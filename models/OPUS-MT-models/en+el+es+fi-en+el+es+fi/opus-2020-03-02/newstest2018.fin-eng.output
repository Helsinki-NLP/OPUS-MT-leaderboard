Camille Auer wanted to fix his sex, diagnosed as a mental illness, and now he makes art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body."
There are dozens of patient reports on the roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Arts.
Every one of them reads Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-year story about how outside people have written their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
They've decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person about my moderate medical history so that the violence of the process would become visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long period of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a transmission of "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
In Auer's case, the process started four years ago.
Even before this he had used the estrogen he ordered through the Internet and was in a very long way in his own repair process.
He found himself a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process so that sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the strengthening of the sex of transsect (563/2002) requires transsect people to be forced into sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
Currently, psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of inability to reproduce are required for each gender to be corrected.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and infringes human rights," says Auer.
The reform of Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary decision which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
The elections came and the Peruvians rose to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
It is about internal political disputes that do not even have to do with this law.
"The government does not want to raise it on the table because there are differences within the government to change the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Finnish Department of Amnesty.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of these is made up of packs and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient facility, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolis psychological interpretation of the University Hospital of Tampere in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on the basis of this, which would define Auer's legal treatment and assistance.
The consciousness of the reality to be investigated appears exposed to devastation.
The concept of self-exploitation appears to be fragmented and the unstable features associated with personality are highlighted in a borderline manner.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these pictures.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," says Auer.
Even greater shock was when Auer was not given gender-remediation treatment.
According to the treatment staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting space of the transpolis.
Later, artworks called Monument for the Excluded were created on that television, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born a woman can increase her breast, but to remove breasts needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you try to be other than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality.
The gender correction process is harder for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its members meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment by appealing to the fact that their resources are not sufficient," Auer says.
Many process applicants have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential temptation experiences.
With these appeals, caregivers may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and assistance can lead a person to a worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had self-destructive thoughts all along my adult age and that's what people usually find hard to melt."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started to use hormones, feeling relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenage age.
Why the wide jaw did not feel fit for your own body and why the breast of the muscles should be round instead of a steady chest.
The most important thing for Auer was that there are people near him who see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using the sound and moving," he says.
Now that Auer is already experiencing being seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stage of the process, a lot of random comments could have been hurt.
It hurts the most when the close ones are sexually abused.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they will not or will be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria or body conflict where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long-term research process, no formal confirmation can be obtained for their own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-age applicant shall make a written application for a new identification, indicating that he or she is experienced by another sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm its application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identification.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition will also be removed from this requirement.
It has not been an artist's therapeutic experience, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes during which politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The Civil Law Agency issued a travel warning to Missour
The National NAACP, which drives the Afro-American Citizens' Rights, has issued a travel warning on Missouri, which is the reason for the state's discriminatory practices and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
"NAACP's travel report on Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been numerous racially controversial events," the organization's newsletter states.
The recently enacted Missouri law makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to the right, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionately directed at minorities, according to NAACP, which led to the provision of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin colour, assaulted or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of the NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of one case before in such a short time."
Missouri's travel information is the first warning to the US state of the organization.
The organization cited the racist comments made against African American students at Missour University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and the Missouri police arrested him even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel release also referred to Missour's report that the police will probably stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white one.
"The purpose of the travel release is to invite people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missour," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare themselves, for example, by taking money for bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015 a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missour, or the sixteenth most of the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also an answer to Missour's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the right to reside and to discriminate in employment relations.
The ACLU civil rights organization, which has recently been guaranteed by the Constitution, issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which the system says adds to racial profiling.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes travel warnings and concerns other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
General: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Mr Mika Lintilä (center) has asked Finnair for an explanation of the additional pension fee received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, Yle says.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's expression of will.
The additional pension of EUR 130,000 was raised this week when the Helsinki Sanomat newsed on the development of the remuneration of the managers of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Journal of Photography reports on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said he was giving up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has set out that additional pensions are not used to reward.
The state owns over half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision on the principle of ownership.
Forces made it harder to talk right away.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting of the industrial countries in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to have a great deal to do with each other.
Since then, the mood has become very cool.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted fiercely in Russia.
So far, the most stunning response has been heard by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the law of sanctions signed by Trump is a "full-scale trade war".
Even if Russian reactions were to be attributed only to political rhetoric as peaks and superstitions, the blackmail between the United States and Russia is the fact that after the short post-Trump choice of the honeymoon.
In the United States, the passage of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
However, the Congress adopted the Act as a significant consensus, but the adoption of the Act to the President was reported to be considerably more difficult.
Trump therefore recently criticized the law that he signed as a "significant deficiency".
President Trump's fist must have been, in particular, the cause of Russia, although the adoption of a law that restricts his own rights must have been resentful.
As well known, in the United States there is an investigation into Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as Russia's connections with Trump's campaign.
The blackmail between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
After the staff of the White House have changed sharply and various scandalous turns have been revealed almost daily, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being done in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the president.
Such a situation must in no way be desired.
If Russia is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies also to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tensioned security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has seen the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least at the top of its Russia policy united, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a much-trading Member State like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the United States' recent Sanctions Act are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects may be felt in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Phennopower nuclear power plant.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the absence of sanctions, for example, of liquid natural gas in the US economy.
Commerce bans are a means of global politics to show resentment.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and closely monitored.
Otherwise, they are easier to harm than to benefit.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Freedom
The lack of statues is the most certain sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, dropped the statue of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's main ideologies, knew very well what he was doing in a raging debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Liberty Statue was subjected to Miller's attack in a vocabulary on the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of Cruise Organizers and by characters that sucked from the Statue of Freedom.
His attack was aimed at the statue and especially the fact that Emma Lazarus was added to the statue in 1903 — 17 years after the statue was completed.
That's how Miller blew Acosta: "I don't want to go more closely into history now, but the statue of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that enlightens the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller wasn't wrong in himself, but it's not just history, as he said.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teming shore."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller did not practice literature criticism, and he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
Controversy over the importance of the statue of freedom is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the meaning of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to his statue, and they knew very well that the act was a strong political one.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American Republicans with a classic symbol, a woman's body of freedom.
Lazarus changed its significance: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
The incorporation of the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a destructive attack against the American Nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a designer who can now be regarded as some kind of prophesy to Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom does not call anyone, but is the early pioneer of the new Conservatives who takes the United States to the glow of darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty is stepping up.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The tone does not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and challenging journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and better life.
His statue of freedom comforts by giving hope and welcoming him.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their flares do not show the way, but they incite the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Sports Competitions 2017: Neil Black praises the British country team for Scottish members
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the British country team
The Executive Director of the British General Sports Union, Neil Black, says that 16 Scots participating in the World Championships are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the MM competitions in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland "there is something special going on" from which British general sports need to be learned.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it so long that we understand what it is," Black says.
"I met with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Association for Sports again believes that it relates to the activities of the Association,
and the British General Sports Union believes that it is behind their activities.
And the ordinary streetman thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely awesome, which is why it is."
Many Scottish athletes in London are seriously competing for measurements, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre run. Eilidh Doyle, in turn, was elected captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is in vain modest.
His captain's speech was amazing," Black says.
"Employers left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a real feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver star in the 400-metre round of the World Championships of the League, and these are his fifth world championship race, and he thinks it's "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the country team.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
In the course of the year, the average travel runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records.
He competes in London at 1500 yards and 5000 yards.
Chris O'Hare runs in London for 1,500 meters. He also deserves to be watched: he has an excellent season behind him, including the winnings in the British World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship contest, when the only scotch in the country team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the Earth Team says he's "indulgently proud" of having so many Scots involved, some of which are really competing for finals and medals.
"Acknowledgement is a great honor, but even more special is because members of the country team voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the scots that entered the country team.
It shows how far we've gone.
They're involved in earnings as athletes who compete for prize winners.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have a home race.
It is important to enjoy home support and that we are again at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Prevent critics on Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics always in his political principles.
I'm sure the critique was irritating.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led by stupid and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and his attitude was also de minimis online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it's important.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of the state dominated by the Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to hotcake.
He has led the state firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication for his voters and published there a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax resources.
Hogan's informant Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions in his interview with Washington Post, and he said it was only about commentary moderation.
However, tagging commentators as trolleys, spooters or haters is too easy to solve.
Washington Post interviewed Hogan Facebook users.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with their chosen leaders; they were not trolleys but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, considerate and relevant.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his remarks; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland Bowi was not hostile but asked about hate crimes.
"I remarked politely that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in Washington Post's comments.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately viewed as an organised group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The Governor's staff called the comments "centralized as an attack" and someone else could call it to promote important things.
During the Facebook era communication is easy to control by preventing a critic or by removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It is, however, really the same issue, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him to court.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of Alexandria, the government of the county of Loudoun violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution in preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation visited Kentucky's Republican Governor Matt Bevin and the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had a similar effect to that on the Internet today.
The number of words was fourfold from 1776 to 1800, and unnamed writers mocked Washington.
There were trolleys at the time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers calling for Washington decisions.
The President's office was subject to appeals criticizing Jay's agreement on cooperation, trade and maritime cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington's network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the fundamental stones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
Birds should be stopped immediately.
Samplings have come from about ten places, plus online announcements from two or three.
Most of them have become from South and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also individual from Haapavede and Seinäjoki, Specialist Marja Isomursu Evira tells.
The green peppers are dead called tricomonose.
It's caused by a scientist named Trichomonas gallinae, the original animal.
It has previously been known to strike the doves, and especially the doves.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in the mirror poles.
In 2009, it was a very good splash.
At that time, trikomonosis caused a great collapse in Finland's green pea pond, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green peppers, but at least not on a large scale yet, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of the University of Helsinki.
It is fearable that the previous epidemic of green peppers will renew unless something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the summer meal of birds immediately.
Add on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the Renaissance Club homework
For the next three days, Ronan Rafferty, former European electorate, hopes to benefit from the home representation, when the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian hosts the 25th Senior Open tournament in Scotland.
Last year, the Northern Irish Rafferty led a tournament in the Archerfield Links area before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has enjoyed a new place and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will reach its full splendor," says Rafferty.
"Players see the field at their best, it's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great show for this field."
For the first time, the British Eales defends the championship, although he has won his 32-year career both for European tour and for European challenger tour.
"This feels like a very special opportunity," says the player who lives in Southport.
"I couldn't defend Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own soil and went on a tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing at home is always more important than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The third will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament includes six Scots: Orr and former Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All revenues are donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems were solved in the shaft
At least there have not been any internal air problems in the pori private's telecommunication company so far, the private was told on Thursday.
Internal air surveys will continue.
The reports began when the man who interrupted his service for health reasons thought that his health was weakened because of the poor indoor air in the body.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other shipowners.
It became apparent that this was an individual case and that other servants of that unit had no health problems.
Each report is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment it is not known that we have any internal air problems, Holma says.
The Private report states that due to the arrival of the July batch, goods had to be transferred to the armies, and therefore dust could have increased temporarily.
That's why the air may have seemed dreadful, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Golden Country
Bardina Degei doesn't use soft food in the kitchen.
It's just that he rarely uses the roof.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Indonesia in Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a bataat – locally "not" – directly into his fireplace.
In half an hour, the battalion burned on the karre will be eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dege's home, and he sits on a muddy painting floor where he usually takes care of his daily ashes, such as the washing of the close wool in the same water.
The office of the toilet will deliver a bucket in the indoor room.
Degei is one of the four wives of his youngest husband, and he has not been appointed to care for the fields.
Multi-marriage is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare stumbling block at the top of the ancient Papuan colony in the former Dutch colony, which was joined to Indonesia in 1969. The controversial referendum preceded the accession, where 1,026 villagers were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement that opposed the Dutch power quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which firmly controls the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights monitors from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and Western Papu. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and a corner. The trip there starts on a 15-hour flight from the capital of the province from Jayapur to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the abdomen on a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
Some 19,000 people in the city are surrounded by wooden houses in the bamboo, where the rust of the waves has become yellow rusts.
Only a few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the people of Papua Mee Pago worshipped the god of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," says Degei. "He means his colorful, hand-woven wax, dark tooth and bright-coloured sweater.
"Before we had only magazines covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden country.
Paniai is about a New Jersey-sized upper area with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 miles from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most productive gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced US$ 3.1 billion of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, it is estimated that Papua has $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans because they mean the suppressing presence of the strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million in 1998–2004, with up to $150,000 being paid to individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater self - control threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has since 1969 killed over 500,000 beans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres at the tops of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were associated with genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 people in peaceful demonstrations in the region.
Brisbane Archbishop's report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of previous year's brutalities, such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electronic attacks are particularly popular means — and unspeakable attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases per week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch organization.
Ruvia has been blackmailed when Papua's natural resources attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing when the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes, the people of Indonesia, change the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javascript warung food cakes sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The converters have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than the local ones," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the province capital after work.
"The local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former wooden chapel won the vote in 27 areas, including in Pania, on its way to the Jakarta President's Castle.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our hopes and restore justice," You says.
Pania had some kind of wave base only two months after Jokow's October official appointment.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in motorcycles.
The scared children told the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man came back with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers captured and assaulted children with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the state election board, located near the event site, was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
Approximately a thousand beans — young men, women and children — gathered on the football field before the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They were accompanied by the hunting armies for holidays, and they began to perform the traditional wait dance of the Papúa Mee Pago family, which dances in the ring and tracks the bird song.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed up, soldiers received an inner radio system command: "If human forces resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that has not been published on the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, perceived the situation to be devastating and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the military lines.
"A number of shots were fired in the detachment."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times.
"I ran to him and made sure that it was really him," Yohanes TIME told him as a sad one. In the way of many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a police informant of Papua in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The next day, the information about the killings came to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it will never happen again."
In October 2016, the Minister for Security Wiranto said that he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speeches immediately.
"A great part of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The United Nations is accusing Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". Crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the 1999 referendum on independence in East Timor. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of Paniai victims are obsessively disbelieving about the allegations.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He tells me he's still alive in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians dare not discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me in their hands after the victims are buried," he says.
The shots aren't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighbouring Paniai area in Deiya.
One died and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the construction company's leader, which began when the leader refused to take the man who lost consciousness into the hospital, and children were also among the injured.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Hated villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the mobile police unit of Indonesian military police opened fire to the crowd, killing a villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to care.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyan Parliament has called for shots of police officers to be held responsible and the removal of a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem with the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the wheat of Papua.
Many have joined the liberation movement of Papua (OPM), an army of rebels, claiming to defend the rights of the beans by occasional attacks and by kidnapping the soldiers of the Indonesian army.
Some of OPM's leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and arresting thousands of people in Pania in the name of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "surprising, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There's only a little rice to sell in Enarotal, and that's too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batatics and some fruits and vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility can be four or five battalion fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over the period, differences in the livelihoods of local and immigrants have increased and the number of immigrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to locally better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Only a few beans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of Paniai's Family Council.
The distant Papua remains a little of the world's attention.
Moreover, restrictions on international news are still strict.
Previously this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not held his electoral promises, and he has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news.
"Indonesia's most restless eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papu have new risks: denying visas and blacklisting," Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that only the neighbours of Papua are pressured by the Indonesian government.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numbered and widespread violations", including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the liberation movement in Papua.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informant Arrmanatha Nasir challenged the allegations and told the journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want the foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the Human Rights Envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapur on 4.5.2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports an anonymous source.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections for 2019, but the beans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in Paniai's shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the Family Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Paniacs: they live under the power of the greedy and unpredictable army in lack and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the other beans, hold the voices they gave to Jokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of Paniai's shooting attack once again showed a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country of the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says in the press.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora retrieves Robert Helenius' replay: "Edes their own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora, who were going to fight a heavy series of boxers in the Hartwall Islands on 27 May.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a fresh IFL TV interview, Chisora gnaws the reason for the failure of the re-entry match to Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland flocked, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fighting because he's so bad, Chisora's making a fool.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full Hartwall in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score sentence.
The ticket sales of the re-entry match went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was moved to autumn.
There's nothing new about the fight.
However, the withdrawal no longer harms Chisora.
In any case, the fight would probably have to be cancelled after Chisora got sick.
Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up in hard pain.
My tyranny was blown up.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's currently in a 45% condition.
He's not interested in the replay with Helenius. He's aiming at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered the loss of Whyte in December.
It came to repeat your power in Dubai of the Torch Cloud Drawer.
The Lieks took over the world's highest reading residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants had to flee 337 meters from a 79-storey building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building whose name happens to be Torch, ring.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were sleeping, and we woke up the fire alarm loudly and in people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George's resident told Reuters.
According to Dubai's rescue authorities, fire extinguished at four in the morning local times and remained cooled out of the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outdoors of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch Building carried out a study in which it found that the most damage was caused by the discs used in the curtain and insulation of the public pipe.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower insulation and versatile plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire in which 80 people died in June.

In the United States, more than 20 per cent of air passengers take prohibited items into the aircraft, reveal questionnaire survey
A survey of air traffic traffickers reveals that more than 20 per cent of passengers in the United States had consciously or unknowingly exported prohibited objects to aircraft through the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints, with at least six per cent of passengers having knives or other objects equipped with steel that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only later learned that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey and implemented by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
TSA's rules were clearly violated by 19.7% of passengers who were representatives of the Y generation and under 15 % of the X generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and fluid into the aircraft.
More than 3% admitted that they consciously took the goods with steel into the aeroplane. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had consciously taken the prohibited drugs into the aeroplane.
Passengers from across the United States participated in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of them had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to take out smuggling goods — consciously or unknowingly.
But as the company that asked the question states, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what fluids they can take to the plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also the thought that books should not be taken into the airplane.
You can take liquids on domestic flights but not on international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay Obama's decision to reduce emissions during the period
The day after 15 Länder had challenged Scott Pruitt, Director of the US Environmental Protection Agency, to the court, Pruitt withdrew its previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions of smoke from Obama during the management period.
According to Pruit, the change demonstrates that the Agency which he has led will better take into account the needs of decision-makers responsible for environmental issues in the Länder.
Pruitt did not mention, in any word, an action against his previous decision brought before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should begin to comply with the level of requirement for land ozone as of 1 October 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he will postpone the implementation of decisions over the year, so that his agency will have more time to learn about the plan, because the Agency "does not want to intervene in local decision-making or hamper economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
After coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against chemicals and fossil fuels.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the last setback to Pruitt's plan to mitigate regulations.
The Federal Appeal Court in Washington last month adopted a decision that the EPA leader exceeded his authority in attempting to delay the implementation of Obama's decision on the administration of oil and gas companies, which forced the companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In the opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full translation of the ozone rules only strengthens EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in line with the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to challenge the right to agree on timetables," said Pruitt. He challenged the environmental law more than ten times in his previous action.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and take it seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and its powers for us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt may continue to exercise its "authorities to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are driving a wider change in ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
This week, EPA's general prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the state consortium, told us that the group intends to continue to exert pressure.
"The mental change of the EPA as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed in their communities to the direct effects of smoke," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia were involved.
The earth's ozone arises when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
Such a smoke - foam can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive human groups, which is also a part of thousands of premature deaths each year.
People's health promoters and environmental protectionists rejoiced at the surprising change in direction of Pruit.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing air use of sound sense," says Lori Ann Burd on the Biodiversity Centre.
"We have to fight against Trump's regime, because its ideological objective is to act on the conditions of contaminants and other groups of their own interests."
A street turf from the super-car manufacturer "is happening in the Ferrari style"
It will also contribute to hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in the Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the briefing session on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All cases of East Savo ashes vaccination of the same virus type
The infection of the ashes of the swamp is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, informs THL.
On Thursday, the laboratory of the health and well-being plant has ensured that the fifth ashes vaccine infection in Eastern Savo is the same level of virus with previous infections.
THL has ensured that on Friday, 28 July, an ash vaccine infection has the same type of virus as previous East Savo cases.
On the basis of this information, all infections in East Savo relate to the first ash in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't brought up any other types of ashtray virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth diseased follow-up may still occur until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for infectious diseases in Soster.
Since the fifth confirmed case, there have been no new ashes infections or their suspicions.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds us.
More on: In Pirkanmaa, three new ash vaccine infections were confirmed - "Infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a permissible scream
Pontika's soup was not even considered legal.
In the background, the reason is that the process produces, in addition to wine, methanol that is toxic.
It's legal next year to make a kilju at home, but the legalization of pontika's soup is not even considered.
The spark is made by fermentation, the pontic again by distillation.
There is a reason behind the regulation of the distillation that the process, together with wine, produces methanol that is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the soup of the pontika as every human right, commented by the Government Adviser Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Law, the pontika distillation was not considered legal.
Nor was the matter brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, Mr Outi Mäkelä (Code) states.
He is a member of the group of the Groups of Parliaments of the Governing Parties, who took the view of the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Promise to distillate the pontika at home cannot be granted in any future.
Commercial manufacturing is also maintained as authorised.
Importing tells us that the domestic manufacture of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol is allowed to be produced at home by use.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can make a legal yell.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavour and aromatics and allows for the production of a kiln, Mäkel to be specified.
The preparation still needs to be done so that the ingredients or flavourings and flavourings produced during their use are clearly visible.
According to the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as they want, and selfish alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on sale.
The act of a squirrel is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Importing believes.
Much greater change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under scrutiny by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcoholilaki will come to the House as soon as the September season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law shall enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like the House has already taken a stand, Mäkel is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was escorted to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspicions of heart attack.
Pistorius has already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
The Pistorius family informant, for his part, said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the six-fold gold medal of the Paralympics for six years in prison for the murder of Reeva Steenkampi's girlfriend.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
Interrupted telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The lithoids of the telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia's leaders have leaked into Washington Post.
Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to end his public talks on 27 January 2017 that he will not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto that this had knocked down the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build a South American border at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a littering of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call there was a tight exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia must be "bad," "bad" and "bad." Trump said that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugee settlement in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgian massacre: Activists re-arranged racist lynching in the hope of justice
Ford Mercury's branded car crosses the crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car arrives on the bridge.
The leader of the band, a middle-aged man dressed in a raven, takes a deep breath of his cigar and tires through the windscreen.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man's talking.
"Get out of the car!"
Screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a replanting, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the shocks are genuine when a hang-eyed eye is put on the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-start events in 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live among us and many people need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps replanting arrangements.
"It's the shame of history, but above all it's the burden that weighs our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
For him, replanting is a shocking invitation to action, and it also reminds the residents of Monroe that iniquity has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice. We want things finally to be completed, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation before we get justice."
The Investigator will cover the body of the victim killed in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI's records of the NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching from Monroe and its surrounding counties.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have always been known by locals: politics and sex.
In 1946 the blacks of the state of Georgia had the highest court decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the elections where a black farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landlord Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently touched the wife of Malcom, Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI's information, Loy Harrison, an influential white landlord, paid the $600 guarantee for Malcom, which was released from prison.
On the way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford bridge.
"It has become apparent that Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. The authorities were involved in murders and lost evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks's pointing it out more closely.
"It was a voter murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to communicate to the blacks that they would be the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the replanting of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The proposal is extremely realistic and incarcerative, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States.
It is difficult to look at the proposal, but it is even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
"We do not want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and twenty whites — met to listen to the routine Greene presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
He has been presenting a local Ku Klux Klan leader in replanting for years, but the role is always just as difficult and resentful.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history also be brought up so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's angry that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear?
Rascona or Hester is answering.
Then the hit goes.
And then all (at least all the black actors) squeeze into laughter.
Greene's laughing harder.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too fast?" he asks.
"Not," Greene's beating.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n---u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the power of the room is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are outrageous.
No one's laughing.
The replantation will end quickly and violently.
Hurts, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral house is standing next to the bodies and singing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks in every other word.
A few ten meters away, 50 viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the population is black and half white.
There is a couple in the crowd who have come to see the show from Ithaca from New York State, but most of them are local.
They have been guided by Brooks by the victim's grave in Georgia's pressuring moisture.
Murders have turned from the story to the truth, and the sensation at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
The children are engulfed to look at artificial blood and unmovable bodies and whisper each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutizes like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actresses who played Lynchers stripped their wits and wiped tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then she tears out after a hard show.
"It's okay," there was a woman involved in the show to comfort.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altanta is discussing the performance with the black couple he has just met.
Denise Duplinsk is difficult to find words when describing the performance's emotions.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch the terrible deeds that people say and do, who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"The performance made me realize that lynxes are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Replanting is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also a teaching experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Depletion of plants in stores is shocking: this amount of "over-the-counter" removal actually saves
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower cabbage already in the store before weighing?
What about taking the big hat out of the pineapple? That's how much it weighs?
The answers share the opinions strongly: one of them is a sign of extremely stiffness, others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go home to the trash.
The phenomenon will be identified in the stores.
For example, there are cartons in the K-Citymarket Vegetables Department of the Helsing Crowd, because many of them, for example, rip out the leaves of the flower cabbage.
From the box, the magazines are taken to the bio-waste store.
According to the news published by the Economic Plants, the numbness of the vegetarian is a wonder for the merchants.
But how much extra parts of vegetables before weighing really saves money?
How important is this really about numbness?
We women test how the price changes when they take off the leaves or stocks from the pineapple, latva-artizoo, delicacies, parsley and flower cabbage.
Flower cabbage: €2.10 the price of the flower cab was €1.80 when all the leaves were shelled.
Ananas: The price of the total pinnacle payable by EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position turned away.
Latva-arthioka: EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Delicacies: Two of the delicacies cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Parsakal: The medium-sized parsakal paid €1 and without a load of 80 cents.
Outcome: If magazines and stocks go off, it saves a few dozen inches for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
It would therefore have saved a total of EUR 1.20 from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brazilian star signed a five-year agreement with the PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP News Office.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the football league to FC Barcelona for 222 million euros.
The amount of transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League brake the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment firm of Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the League, the buyer company cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which takes place by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money to Barcelona through the league.
Neymar's supposed to be coming to Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to the new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines details
Barcelona also informed the European Football Union Uefa when informing that it would provide information on the payment to enable it to determine the disciplinary measures that might arise from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that PSG is violating the rules of the fair economic game of Uefa in its financial use.
Uefa can punish the company that will make more than EUR 30 million loss over three years.
Uefa says Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economic stalls.
Neymar's transfer to PSG affects the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be evaluated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players with significant sums, Uefa was notified.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, was severely damaged by the lightning attack. The seal was stored on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was working on an airplane at the International Airport of Lounas-Florida with a couple of working friends, when suddenly the rainy sky hit the airplane.
The power of lightning threw the plane into the land of the Dann near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and said that his brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
That's not what you can expect.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells us.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on time and the transport movement itself decided whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business dividends by cutting
The British Educational Group Pearson announced on Friday that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it started in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already decreased 4 000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
In May, Pearson announced that it would again cut expenditure by 300 million pounds as part of its third savings programme, aimed at reviving the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it maintained its view of the year, which increased its turnover in the first half of the year and amounted to £2.05 billion.
Attack to a convoy in Kabul: Nato's soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber hit a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, according to authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers were injured and interpreted.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in the suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol of the NATO-Afghanistan army was attacked by a "person carrying a personal explosive device".
The opinion stated that all injured were stable and treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20 per cent in the capital city.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, in an area that mainly lives in Shiiamuslims.
The Taliban reported that he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, over 150 people were killed in a bombing attack in the centre of Kabul, which was the most devastating attack by the militant group in the country after the U.S. troops raided the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA cancels its decision to postpone the implementation of the Smoke Smoke Regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, overturned its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions of smoke in Obama's management period on the day after 15 Länder had challenged the Agency's court.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "ozone assessments" in 2015 late on Wednesday. According to the Agency, the decision is a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," President Scott Pruitt said in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone screenings by one year until October 2018. The definitions indicate that the smoke flood rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 states dominated mainly by the Democrats, including the District of Columbia. They claimed that the postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to alleviate Barack Obama's environmental provisions. Trump says measures are part of a broader economic growth programme.
Trump's measures have been opposed by democrats and environmental protectionists who are concerned about the health impact of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA websites, air breathing containing ozone "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person of father's leadership characters had also sent to Sydney bomb builders.
The suspects said the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell you more exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas excretion device and to take the device into a filling place in public, for example, a public transport facility.
Assistant Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
Nesteen Managing Director: Renewable Fuels Successfully
The result of Nesteen oil refiner before taxes fell, but it hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievosen, the company made good results in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products increased to the record level and the development of Marketing & Services' business profits was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profits improved the tax relief of US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievosen, this year's operating profits for renewable products remained at a good level thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the press.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of less than 66.7 kilos, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports stations in Los Angeles until WBC's unsuccessful champion Mikey Garcia walked along the hall to greet Lomatšenko, the master of the WBO's top feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the showtime by a unanimous decision by Adrien Broner of the former four-class world champion, after which Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the top five of the matching list of different grades.
Garcia gave her right hand and asked, "How you doing, Master?
Good luck in the fight!"
On Saturday at 7 a.m. on the ESPN channel, he defends his title against Miguel Marriaga.
When the two had the photographers, Lomatšenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the fight between men would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm a former feather series," Garcia reminded me.
"I went up a series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small one, 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight series.
He has to go up to a series of lightweights [61.2 kilos]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
"Let's fulfill their wishes."
The holidays were in agreement.
"Fighting needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko, which says that Lomatšenko debytoi in the lightweight series later this year and will fight Garcia (37–0, 30 wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will play in the lightweight series at the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else gets that much attention.
It's okay with me as soon as we get a deal..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatšenko as a "unbelievable fighter" and maybe he was going to go see the game Saturday.
The holidays interrupted Garcia's rejoicing on her goat and said that this three-class champion from Riverside looked "too slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed it to crash."
Garcia said she focused on showing the force of attack first and then on boxing.
Men said they felt that the fight between them was wanted to take place more and more.
"This is the game we're expecting.
No other match raises the same attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
"Mikey is a legend.
It'll be a great match."
Average wage EUR 5 300, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Lastly, Helsing Sanomat told Ritvasta, 68, to whom bankers' investment counsellors spoke full bums when selling investment products.
Investment advisers and various rules on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The proposals are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will be implemented from the beginning of next year.
The current assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define knowledge requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that the investors perform their own APV1 or APV2 degrees.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for the APV investment firm called Oy, which is based on experts from both universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 study points, and their experiments are produced by Aalto EU, the Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website states that, in general, both tests are "a fairly wide-ranging in terms of requirements".
The study materials include 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of the Oy, reports that the pass rate of the tests is roughly estimated at around 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose staff appear to have maped the completion of qualifications, says Savikko.
He says there are "others" of these bankers.
According to Saviko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has been conducted by 13 000-14 000 persons and some 3 000 persons who are more demandingly recommended for investment advisers.
Some bankers think that graduation is an advantage.
In the other sectors, there are considerably more stringent skills requirements.
The Savik says that the Financial Recommendation requires that APVs be completed, since then the investment-related skills are ensured.
According to the Statistical Centre, financial and investment advisers make on average a number of thousands of euros per month, including natural resources and income premiums.
The average monthly working time is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in tasks make an average of EUR 5 900 and women more than EUR 4,500.
On average, the most profitable decade deserves about EUR 8 100.
The tenth of the most earning men earns more than EUR 9,000 per month or more, the tenth of the most earning women make more than EUR 6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act may only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, the level of employees and duties has been relied upon in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, individual cases in which the professional qualifications and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the advisory activity were received during the audit.
In principle, the salesman of investment products can also act even if the skills and qualifications are weak.
On this basis, the situation has been wild and free.
In several other sectors there are considerably more stringent skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, the new Financial Market Directive (MIFID II) will make this more stringent as of the beginning of next year.
It requires each undertaking to be responsible for having sufficient expertise in the provision of investment services.
Financial supervision, for its part, may be empowered to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva Market Manager Marko Hovi reports that one of the clear changes to the present is the legislation on the knowledge and experience of investors and vendors of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both the staff of investment firms and related agents selling products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that according to a proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
Whatever they are, they will be decided in these prospects during the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to provide necessary training and, where necessary, monitoring and complementary training.
All this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The court states that in practice, for example, the company must map the personnel's actions at individual level.
This will certainly come from different standards, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a certain time-consumer who meets the criteria.
According to the Court, this change will make the rules more tight and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger machine "drawing" a giant aircraft over the United States
The route flying the plane was drawn above the United States in the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday 787 Dreamliner, when Boeing tested the durability of Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
During 18 hours and 1 minute, the plane left Seattle, which is longer than any standard commercial route in use in the world, flew 15 700 kilometers.
The flight stayed all the way within the borders of the United States.
It flew a total of 17 states.
Imatra's steadfast coastal bathing schoolchildren do not have a moment of rain or sun toast - Iines Kaikkonen polski steadfastly with the help of a swimming pool
Iines Kaikonen moved forward at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra Beach Swimming Schools are going to Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though sometimes it rains and then it flies again, young swimmers aren't even moxis, the swimmer of the swimming schools boasts of Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children will be charted, next week's tenth.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that then school and the Eskari began, evaluated by Itkonen.
The Imatra Coastal Swimming School will organize a joint exercise project with the city of Imatra.
Thursday at Liette's swimming pool there was a nice atmosphere.
The sun baked and the young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with the swimming pools, someone already without it.
They also enjoyed smaller sisters in the water.
Iines Kaikos, 5, thought he'd go deeper into the water first.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to hike towards the beach.
It's good!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that he went to a lot of swimming this summer.
She's a good swimmer.
Like Iines Kaikkosen, swimming with the swimming pool practiced vigorously with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You'll be happy with the achievements of today, too, the swimmer's cheers.
Jami Kallio, 4th, wanted to go to water wars at times.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 baths on the beach, holds the coastal swimming school as a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes we had to warm up.
Swimming schools packed up on the dock.
The boys had enough work with a frog found on the beach.
Million Luukonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towels to the pier, grabbed fruits and baked the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but there was no rush on the dock.
It's the kind of thing that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "Here's a combining story."
Everything you see.
Manufacturer of cleaning products Blue product lanseered a few days ago from the unknown military product series.
I mean, dishsticks and washing machines, and "wc-brush with edgebrush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film that he receives in the fall of his first night and to the marketing of a movie.
However, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been discarded in social media: When do Unknown Health Links come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does the Vice President of Sinituott say, Aino Määttä?
We're a partner in the movie.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult movies, Määttä says.
He says that the products come into a special showcase, and that's how the film gets visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this... often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is such a combining story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic values of Finland, which are supported by those who have seen an unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to the military culture, Määttä points out.
Other partners in the unknown military film are Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwallin Vichyt has been introduced to the market, which is named Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been récorded to the blogger Kalle Kinnunen of Finnish Photography
There are also coffees and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's first night, so the continuation is still under promise.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen have not yet revealed their military products.
The new results of Swedish asylum applicants' age tests were published
The latest results of the medical age tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published, and the results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be more than 18 years of age, but not all of them are considered reliable.
The Swedish National Medical Agency began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be evaluated in more detail than the age of the asylum seeker, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Immigration Agency has conducted 6,880 tests so far, and the Office of Legal Medicine has now published 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the 80 per cent tested in 2002, the asylum seekers were found to be older than 18 years of age, and the legal medicine agency determined 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the asylum seekers are "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson's Office of Legal Medicine reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. Large differences in previous months' statistics are not visible," he told The Local magazine.
Although a large proportion of applicants were found to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that applicants had lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 results of the test and reported that 442 cases had "references to the study being 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it became clear that in 243 cases the applicant had been openly informed that he had completed 18 years this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and magnetic images of the knee vein. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, endocrinologist of the Karolinin Institute, whose work involves assessing human biodiversity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure how to determine age, we should not pretend to be able to do that," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Office of Legal Science defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can be commonly said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the greatest situation in which the test will soon be completed for 18 years, and then the risk will be about 10%."
Jolonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par results in the third round took place in Mikko Ilosen's 30th sections, downwards in the European golf course competition in Scotland.
Jolonen left on Saturday's day in place of 11th, but found at the end of the round to share 41th place.
In a difficult keel, there was a double-bog accumulation of three bog.
Others were having trouble, too.
The Englishman Ian Poulter rose up to split the corner of one in less than a couple rounds, although he said there was enough work to be done in holding an umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I stuck with it and finally the day was good, Poulter's point.
He's sharing the headline with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of Western Virginia will exchange the party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of Western Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that Trump's campaign would exchange the party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflections... "Today I will tell the West Kirginians that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats."
The audience came up with the raging applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican party," added Justice.
"I'd like to tell you, as a preparer, that it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support Hillary Clinton as a candidate for the Democrats.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father's mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published an opinion that "the exchange of the Party of Governor Justice is a new blow to the democratic party, which prefers to build obstacles rather than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest backlog to a party that has no leadership and cannot find a positive, human-combining message," RNC's representative Ronna McDaniel said in his statement to the CBS news.
The lightnings sowed damage from Thursday, even the summer's very rough day.
In the end of the week, more thugs will also be made available to southern Finland.
Over the past week, it has been thwarted especially in the middle and north of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suome.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the lightning strikes lit a number of fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a very busy summer day.
The old deaf have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, it has been lightning especially in the middle and north of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suome.
The lightning hit the line house's power center, causing a little fire.
The rescue facility received a report of the fire at about 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
The electric centre was located in the sauna room at the end of the line house.
The rescue plant bottled the roof and the wall to find the fire shells and turned the fire off viciously.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
On the shore, the lightning set the outfits of the outfit in Harjuland before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could only prevent the fire from spreading.
About 50 square meters of the building was burned to the ground.
In the direction of the deck, the lightning hit the house again.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a striking flash of lightning.
The rescue department was there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire early - only a few meltdowns went off.
In transport, the bulk caused problems on the railroad between the Wall River and Vaasa, when the lightning damaged the traffic control system.
The information on the fault was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be solved shortly before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with a large range of tracks.
Lightnings have sown destruction across Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively small this summer.
These things of this summer have been completely unfinished! evaluated by the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is the emergency friend of the Institute of Air Science.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mainly moderate, but the summer's small wave of lightning also makes it feel even powerful.
This might feel really tough, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the country secrets ramped 1,700 times, and there has been potential on Thursday for even the hardest day of summer: by about 16:00, there were 1,790 land secrets in the plaque.
If the lightning continues on the early side of the evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, the prediction of Tuovine.
The previous récord weakness was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning in the year was approximately 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning had increased to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something interesting so that this year does not break the record two years ago.
However, the Ukkoskir can expect to continue.
According to the importers, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and wet during the end of the week, which is an acceptable birth environment for males.
The main weight of the Ukkos will be shifted from the northernmost parts of the country to the south for about 2 000 days of lightning on both Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the earth, there is a more unified saderity.
That's what Tuovise says. It's just a few of them.
Coe praises Russia's open-minded apology for doping scandal
World sports manager Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as openly described by Russia on Thursday because of the doping scandal, but he added that it was not time to terminate the Russian ban on participation.
Russian sports director Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken away from the competitions of gold or silver."
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from the sport competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA report presented evidence of State support for doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straightforward, a very open-minded presentation," IAAF President Coe told the journalists.
"The Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Sports Union had admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said that he was "happy" that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has taken place, but Congress supports the recommendation of the Working Group that it is not the right time to stop the ban on Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize our situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the position of a neutral athlete in London at the World Sports Competitions beginning Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, the IAAF Task Force leader, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before it can be restored.
"The test is still inadequate and the trainers who have been banned are still working freely," he told the reporters on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The film Tom of Finland did not come as successful as the authors wished, Yle says.
If honestly said, I am disappointed to acknowledge the film produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle at the interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached just 100,000 viewers, which is the budget of the film, about EUR 5 million, compared to little.
There was no lottery gain in this, but now it's important that investors get their own back.
If the movie had succeeded better in homeland, they would have already had their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football euros do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive transfer of football players ever.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the UEFA regulating European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Masters League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million after the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's colony sum and joining him in his star arts, as it follows to finance the wealthy ruling generation of Qatar's oil.
The clubs will be able to use large sums to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that football business is not lossful.
The fair game economic rules were drawn up at the initiative of the French Michel Platin, elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Plattini believed that the pursuit of success by debt was a deception and led to serious problems if banks or owners took their support.
In 2011, the priority of fair game economic rules was shifted from the debts of the series to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich purchased a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair game economic rules will last until 2018, during which the company will be allowed to make up to EUR 30 million loss.
Although Platin was forced to leave UEFA's presidency in 2015 scandalically, his successor Alexander Cefer also wants to curb the uncontrolled use of money in the clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in place, and we will also apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the fair game's economic rules at UEFA, told Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a single compensation, it may period the amount in the accounts for the duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so that the transfer amount can be recorded for EUR 44.4 million per annum over the next five years.
According to fair game economic rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The main sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi, Manchester City.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the company was ordered to limit its League of Masters to 21 players for the 2014-2015 period instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors joint ventures that may attempt to circumvent its economic regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the company's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari Tourism Authority's support for PSG was over-limited.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by payments available from the World Football Arrangement Commission for 2022.
However, the PSG and the Arrangements Committee have banned Neymar from making an envoy of the GM competitions, which would be very easy for UEFA to reveal.
As a result of the previous sanctions of PSG, UEFA follows more closely the rules for companies.
On Thursday, sources reported that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press Office on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542,4 million and operating profits exceeded EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and to increase the sale of company products and jerseys.
The company estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % under the Neymar agreement.
Since the departure of the best player in the world, a clearly irritated Spanish league tried to hinder the transfer of Neymar, allegedly violating the economic rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic case of doping for both the company and the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state's financing of the football club's activities. Arsenal owns an American sports pool.
"The term is the result of ownership that has changed the football environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
Compliance with fair game economic rules will be extremely difficult. There are so many interests related to the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Now it's busy: Finnish MM athlete coach stuck in Helsinki
Length jumper Arttu Pajulade and Trinitarian Kristiina Mäkelä Coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train at the World Sports Games in London.
Christian Mäkel may have to compete without the advice of his coach.
The bakery will compete tomorrow at the length of the jump and Mäkel on Saturday at the trillion.
However, two Coachs, the Armenian Ghazaryan, have not received a visa for Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British embassy without any results.
The coach has an invitation to organize the World Championships as a documentary, but it hasn't been able to get a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first of Brexit's symptoms, or what, the coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always managed visa matters successfully before, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone is looking at the steps in the stadium, Artu Pajulahti said that his coach might be left behind.
MM-Mitali to FinlandLontoo requires a miracle
The World Sports Competitions will begin in London today on Friday and last a fair week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
General sports, land skiing and hockey are the species in which Finnish bench athletes can take passionate attitudes from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other measurements.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes, from value to value, where experience is made up of the athlete's performance to the level that adults' World Medal is genuinely possible.
Now, there are no such young athletes in Finland's small MM team, nor even conkars.
The MM Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glue to track the races, even though London's medals are solved due to the time gap only at night.
Of the previous World Sports contests 2015 Finland received one bronsimital.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Even now, the bold ones are waiting for the Long - Sea dimensions, even though one tells the results of the last few days of his and the other throwers, and the long - Sealing of the Long - Sea races in the last summer.
Either way in these races, Pitkämäki remains a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish athletes in the races or making a record of their own is a good performance.
To hope and believe in the realistic medals of Finnish sport in the coming years will give a good success in the youth's international value races this summer as well.
It is more important to improve the talents of young people and to support their work than to maintain a small number of elite athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweat work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finnishs can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London races will remain in history in the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, for example, fear of terrorism or poor attacks.
The former Rukajärvi, second in Copper's big air, "but it's too bad."
Snowmaker Ennis Rukajärvi has been placed in the second big air race in the United States Colorado.
Copper Mountain's second in the Ruka Lake is the best big air in the worldcup.
The women's race won the United States Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump of cavalry 1080 for the first time in the races, and it was very close to success.
It's a good feeling, and it's a good fiilis now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go well.
I'm going to try it again in the races from now on, you know, the Rukajärvi.
In the big airs of snowfall, the competitor jumps from the jump for the species.
Viking Line's new speedboat left in the port in Helsinki
The shipowner Viking's new fastship FSTR is badly late for the schedule.
The quickship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6:00.
There was a loading on the ship in eight countries.
The ship's already late for Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for you to get on the ship.
Now the car line moves slightly, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, waiting for access to the ship at Helsinki port, told me at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipowner had brought bottles of water in their cars to the ship.
The Viking Chief of Communications Christa Grönlund tells IS that a technical defect is being put in place.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late from Tallinn's return journey for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disturbs transport on Thursday night
42 meters long special transport moves from Mukos to the port of Mustola during the Thursday evening.
The transport leaving at 9:00 should be here by 11:00 p.m.
The police are conducting traffic on the 6th block, and traffic may be stopped on time.
The transport is on the road to the port of Mustola on the road 13.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, both the days of the glory of the 80's characters and the gringo of the 90's (in those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to bigger cases in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant memory that we have been stuck with during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already lived.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (e.g., H. Jon Benjamin's voice told the background story of the vegetable socket).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors are acting as full-aged, enthusiastic teenagers, highlighting it makes it impossible to reach the past for a part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotionally based, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodiates, for example, stalking films in the 1990s, such as the scary picture of the Hand that coils.
In one point, one of the characters excavates Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet reached Katiesta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one of the crazy people is involved in Ronald Reagan (or Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (who is well played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in series like this, the best sideways are.
Especially fun is to see the ikinuori Paul Rudd, who has underneath the barbecue of Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles. Rudd played by Andy, the king of the camp, begins to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may raise this series as a sort of retractive Seven Up! until it makes its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a team of friends will take their first night of Wet Hot American Summer movie.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again appeals to another sort of nostalgia: the spirit of the cold war series The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie and even the GLOW series, where the east faces the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has become a Romanist police drama in the 1980s, where a bucharest cop fights for truth, atheism and markism-leninism.
In the main, as a hard-faced Gregor and idealist Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulisi. Their turns have been dubaned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police spending time watching TV chess as Americans watch football).
There's a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too attached to the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama, for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not high.
As a whole, the series could work better as an agitprop satire, including when Gregor and Iosef go to the U.S. Embassy and the lobby, there are always two fat men in hamburgers.
The message to the communist public imagined is that Western culture can make all the consumables and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our people were turtles of our own near history and their history.
The Kouvlaian Toni Tauru will rise on Saturday in Macao, in front of the former UFC host.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau, because the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC organisation last year.
Brazil also has a black belt of jujutsu and a world championship of the species.
For one time, I'm fighting myself against an older man.
That's a funny thing. 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvla was supposed to get up in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled because of logistical problems, but three struggles were reached on a short schedule for the Chinese self-government region in Macao.
Tauru hasn't faced that before.
This was the first time my game was canceled.
It was annoying, because preparing and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has been given to the struggle.
Waiting for the week is not much to do with preparing.
The transfer doesn't work because it doesn't improve a week.
You know, the fitness can get worse if it's too much practice now.
In his previous struggle, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are upright.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come in the first round hard and try to get to the mat.
He's won the world championship of the Jujujujuju, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last Kouvla fight didn't go according to the plans.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye corner.
It really hurt for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the freelance fights once a year, some get up in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought for the last time in September.
Tauru, for his part, had three games last year.
Now there's another fight this year ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been practicing in the last few years, and I've been in good condition all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got the joy back.
We got really good training when there was one guy in Sweden.
Practicing was a great help, because on Saturday, the Kouvolian will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a standing fight.
Fighting is a 32-year-old's main tactic.
We have to hit it rationally.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the land myself.
Low exports must not be delivered free of charge, because they are consumed most.
Macao has been attracting Tauru in China before.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great evening in front of you.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to report that it maintains interest rates when economic growth has been unsteady and the slowdown of inflation has put an end to speculations of interest rates.
The central bank of England has warned that economic growth is continuing to slow down, and the Bank transferred interest rates as the income level of families is increasingly under pressure.
The decision makers of the Central Bank's Committee on Monetary Policy decided to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent by 6-2 votes, and this month the consensus received less support because economic growth has been unsustainable.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank dropped its 2017 growth forecasts to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%. It also warned that the income level of households is increasingly under pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to curb Brexit's accelerated inflation, and the Bank also stated that the borrowing costs may have to be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began to take place a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit national vote.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide cheap funding for banks over 15 million pounds, a total of 115 million pounds.
The Protocol to the Bank's Interest Decision states: "According to the Commission's forecast for monetary policy, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years when the decrease in real household income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that "a certain degree of tightening of monetary policy" of market expectations is needed to reduce inflation.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank emphasised that any increases are "steadily" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted 1.9% growth for this year and 1.7% growth for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The price declined over the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound declined by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. Compared to the euro, it declined by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was made after the expected weaker growth figures slowed down the expectations of increased interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to last by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, but it will take a little while at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation report gave little hope for accelerating inflation and low wage increases for households, and the Bank says the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" the fall in revenues in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a low GBP, reversing part of the decrease in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rate was calculated at 0.25% following the EU national vote, which fell to a pound drop.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to be seen in prices and in the economy only four years after.
Before the Bank's most recent decision, interest rates had started to be demanded more and more loudly when inflation was pressurizing domestic pressure, and three decision makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate in July.
Inflation declined to 2.6% last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank it was expected and inflation will be tightened again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2% target level exceeded was due to a "total" low GBP.
"With regard to the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the housing loan market would appear to be further tightened by creditors applying for hot customers and wanting to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is nearing completion. Renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unconsumed options available."
NHS prescribes 10 000 contested HIV medicines
From September onwards, patients may be prescribed a "reversible" HIV inhibition medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute regarding the funding of the medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court held the Supreme Court judgment last year, which states that NHS is able to pay the PrEP, even if it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, leader of the British NHS, called the declared decision "a new major intervention" on Thursday, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are first to receive registrations for the experiment that will be extended to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) should be used prior to co-administration with HIV that reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
The medicine to be taken before intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take this medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, and people with HIV-positive partner who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics choose the conditions for testing from male, female and transgender applicants and from those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered for general medical treatment may also apply for experimentation with their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and this week the NHS of England signed a contract on medicines following an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the test is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and carrying out treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"This is another significant achievement in the struggle that has continued for more than 30 years to resolve the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted for those in need and at risk groups, it may have a reversible effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive a drug funded by NHS that they can decide to use independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect that will improve very many people's lives.
This was a welcome news."
"Now it is most important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group will be excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"PrEP has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people from HIV infection."
"The beginning of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that lasted in vain for several months because of the government's slowdown," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get closer again to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: the intermediate layer and smart decorative solutions have made a small home for the apartment of Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leigh, an enthusiast of real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment at Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's old-fashioned house. The success of Remont tells me that Joanne hasn't packed her stuff yet and moved.
"This before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something like that in my price class.
I went to the apartment show and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment there.
I fell in love right away and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 squares of apartments have experienced a complete change in form.
It was a two-room room where only the kitchen got into the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate layer to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired a job from Erfan Azadin Notting Hill's Duck & Shed Planning Office. Erfan was assigned to use almost four meters of the state of the high rooms and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale destination but a home.
The room elevation was not quite sufficient for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it was able to stand.
The solution required Erfan's creative thinking.
"Territorial structures are pretty complex.
The premises had to be arranged overlapping so that they didn't have to ride.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just suitable both on and below them."
Erfan was able to overlap two full-high rooms with fascinating details.
The intermediate layer opens Retrouvio's copper cross window to a stylish living space.
The mirror-gold furniture, silver decoratives and Serge Mouillen vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, sense of state and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look real farther.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window from which the view opens to the other room.
There is a storage space for Joanne's dining rooms and glassware in the mirror surfaces of the entrance.
It adds to the style that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens equipped with a back door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it's unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of design," Erfan tells us about the steel reinforced MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it's a solution when it's very easy to put up."
With a reasonable use of space and storage space planning Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better bottom solution.
"When selling the apartment, the area is determined – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the main case, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was added using quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the material of the apartment, and the emotional side of the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one sticks to the electrical wires in the walls.
They're important too, but not the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and additions can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
Then it can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of residence hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at the Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a fine pink dress.
Sofia represented on the occasion as a smiling person.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Sweden this week in Båstad.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow Seminar in a beautiful blue body-benefit dress that she wore wonderfully the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue habitat.
This is the last event in which Sofia is represented before birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style crowned big earrings and a stylish little bag.
The Pastellin blue dresses the princess.
Sofia has been in Sweden's Båstad this week.
Sofia filled her suitcase with a small suitcase.
Sofia was just radiating in her very nice summer lodge.
Sofia was enthusiastic at the event even to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to the end of her pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, the Lahti market saw a hoop that sold Thai food.
The Gulfs did not dare to taste, but walked past.
Panya Suamsri-Penttilä was sold in a bowl of food between the familiar Panja.
He did not know much of Finnish, nor did the Finnish at that time yet know of Thai.
Because people didn't dare go to dinner, Panja offered free tasting.
This is how he taught the lakes to eat Thai food, a spring curve at a time.
Taste the countries, he said.
I got stuck from the valley to the hook.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai food fish in the Lahti Trade Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 places.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat next to the plate with a dictionary to learn from Thai.
Two years went by the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spices made themselves said they smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the hall.
There's room there.
Now we swear to be able to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congestive times will we be shy to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows her client.
They'll tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the stages of customer life vary and the food company changes.
He remembers what name I went to eat my first spring round with.
He remembers me as skinny and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit down on my own place next to the kitchen door and change the memberships with Panja, who is in the dish.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has also opened our senses of taste to our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people talk to him about thaita, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's busy.
She goes to the fungus and mustard.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated the fulfillment of two decades.
We customers got dessert of strawberry cake.
Without alarm or attention went this important day, at the edge of the job.
Finding an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
From the beginning of the year, security authorities received a significant list of counter-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 information from the Isis fighter who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, there are 173 persons and the document also contains pictures of each of them, in addition to their personal data.
More than 130 of the people listed in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikstan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening Words told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when investigating the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. Intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpoli.
The list was distributed by Interpoli to all European country security authorities in May.
The background was feared that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists after Father collapsed in the Middle East.
Die Welt says that the list has not only the names and images of all people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the country of the person.
The list also specifies the special areas of terrorists.
For example, the 27-year-old German Sami J. reads the name Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to join the ranks of Daddy.
A special suicide bomber has been written next to him.
There's no more information about the fate of a man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe, with no certainty of fate.
The man fell below the surface at the Tokoin beach in Helsinki.
On the basis of the interviews of the rescue agency, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even the bucket can save the drowning life.
In Tokoinra, Helsinki, a man underwater was rescued on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, Ville Estlander, Helsinki's rescuer, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after notification.
The lifehouse's diver found him underneath the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the first treatment.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
On the basis of the interviews, he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mr. Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the dives excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in the Eura car nine people, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, tells the emergency firemaster.
There are men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at the crossroads of three roads at four hours a day.
The crash happened when the other car turned into a warning three in front of the other car, tells the emergency firemaster.
According to the rescue facility, there is a 80 km/h limit on the crossing area.
Brothers fight for property of over $500 million
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, which is related to their Italian family 40 years ago as a family company.
The former president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis of Carlton's soccer club live only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court over the division of property and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
Brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The family began accruing property when they bought a store at Collingwood Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store, which extended 160 to a chain of movements.
The trade chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as pre-urban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the wealth of the company and Paul about a third of the company. Paul describes his father as "family power and central character".
According to the court's documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns property for about $316 million and Paul for about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first jury certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the highest court after several conciliation companies.
The brothers are now also denying who controls the existing business. Paul argues that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the claim is not true, and he's accusing Paul of the miscarriage of some property.
Colin writes together on his first jury certificates that he would like to come to a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin says in his statement.
The costs of the case are increasing continuously. Pledging statements, e-mails and reports are hundreds of pages. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as insurance when a family purchased a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jean shop.
Colin tells us that he has established a shop "in the last few years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi died in 2012 wanted to transfer the real estate to his sons in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he does not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
Two other boys in the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in De Lutis's business, and Colin said Mark got $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "deep out of economic conditions."
Colin has maintained a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian football league and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to this lifetime in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he told me in his text that it is not right to comment on it because it is dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to court and draw our family's name to a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue this way," Colin continued and said that he was still hoping that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff intends to limit the President's media use.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the use of President Trump's media and the monitoring of the news so that the boss will not be in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new head of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management on his first working day, he spoke of the key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information – whether printed or heard at briefings – must be passed through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If the candidate for President Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was in favour of showing that compassionate media handled things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, a adviser to Trump's campaign, told the Politico magazine in February.
Politico's journalist Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "in the control of Trump's use of Twitter, according to six former campaigners, it is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady flow of cheers."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to argue that Trump's use of Twitter would never have been controlled.
Maybe these campaign workers know something we don't know – maybe Trump's twitches would have been even more gruesome without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems for at least a few times, their work has not been useless.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from being a coward.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views.
In May, Politico wrote that counselors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former workers say that he can get terribly angry at the newspapers that criticize him, especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, and then he must know exactly where the information comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone misleadingly gave the president a copy of the news from the GotNews.com website set up by the online promoter Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of several White House information leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and canceled them later. Nor did he present concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started the story after reading the question about Walsh's staff."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of Staff of the White House, Rob Porter, "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving their own things.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP News Office.
Previously on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the football league to FC Barcelona for 222 million euros.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to move to the Parisian association PSG.
The amount of transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The company is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar's supposed to be coming to Paris on Friday.
Successful writer Raija Oranen said with the hypnosis of alcoholism and flight fear, "I'm okay with my life."
From the TV series Rose time and Puhtaat white sheets known as the successful writer Raija Oranen just celebrated his 69th anniversary.
Hypnose helped Raja Ora.
Five of the grandparents keep grandmothers in such a way when they were writing, that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after the 18th winter.
First they sold their houses, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In the light and the sun, out of the old circles Raijan once took depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
The outer being is 20 pounds lighter than that.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mentally low.
I used to get help from hypnosis in alcoholism, which also worked for flight fear, I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes people, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, also working in the tourism sector, has spent more than 40 years together.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a dramatic queen she's always been, she's done with that, Jyrki's laughing at her wife.
Oranen, a large writer's career, remembers only in good 44 parts of Pure white sheets of a TV series that touched and moved the time of the demise in Finland.
I finally decided that Raikka's family company would be an industrial clothing industry when I read the 50-year interview of Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the sewing daughter myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I used to act as a mannequin, Oranen remembers.
He thought the series was plotted and the story changed the attitude of the Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and the thesis revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as an active writer for an active time, he has many manuscripts under the work - ideas of hundreds.
The Circulars returned over the gate to the Millionaires' Alley.
The most wealthy owners of the West Midlands are once again in the hairstyle with the self-sustaining circles who managed to cross the city's shore and return to the adjoining countryside of the houses.
The circulars parked their twenty trailers near the street called the Millionaires alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they succeeded in crossing the city's fence, which they wanted, and brought with them children, horses, and the army of vans.
The circulars succeeded in crossing the passage block that had been left unprotected because of the path.
The angry inhabitants have accused the municipality of Solihull of "the complete inability to solve the problem".
An unnamed resident tells us that the circularists came on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers by stones.
"The city must be hardened to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulars were here in May, then they left, but they returned again.
They came in more tonight and probably even more today."
The town of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them before, and they have even landed the horse to grazing into the park."
According to Solihulli City's reporter, the municipality is aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are about to take the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to get the campers out as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible notify the police of disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help form a picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
The angry people surrounded the Portuguese crash machine.
In Portugal, people on the beach full of forced landing men have been questioned today in court.
As a result of the forced count, two people died yesterday.
Two men flying the aircraft may be charged with death.
For the longest time, you can get 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, because of a technical error, a small machine that were flying by men was forced to land on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the events, some of whom ran off the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
First, the plane hit a man who was on the back of the plane.
Afterwards, the machine rose up and landed again, hit the child's head, told Philipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small machine immediately after the accident.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started to beat it up, told the case witnessed by Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle there's no more people dead.
There were two men on the machine who didn't get hurt in a forced bill.
The tragically lost Finnish star won the World Culture again: "I wouldn't be a world champion without an accident."
Matti Great-Hamari celebrates early Wednesday morning in Finland's time of MM-kult banked in slalome in the competition held in Canada's Big White.
The Great Hamari won the cross MM in the races before.
All of the MM accounts have now accumulated three.
It's pretty amazing, you know, world races!
Two times we treated the gold, a pretty good beat we pull, the Great Hamari was happy by telephone.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
Great Hamar says the number of challengers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralum board has grown and evolved so much lately.
The gaps are falling, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
He always wonders if a black horse comes after him.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had zealously counted with his friends since he was young, and he did not want to get to the brink.
It's time-to-time that it reminds me of what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to untie.
The cards are played, which is shared, the Great Hamari emphasises.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and lose the border to a lucky break, and the Great Hamari will not do it.
But he turned the terrible difficulty in the interest of him.
Yes, I'd say the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-fold world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest boarding site of the 23-year-old Great Hamar was already underway.
Duni went to the top of the road, and he really did it only after the accident.
When I was young, I was training with the guys, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that were dizzy with some time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the start of X-Games.
I wouldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I was wondering if this would be a very long life if I stayed here to bite and mourn.
I decided to pull the hammers in the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very happy with the choice of the Star for a year's athlete.
The four-fold Olympic winner was awarded a prize at the sports gallery held in January.
Great Hamar says Star's victory is an important signal for the sports people.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open eyes to the sports world.
When is it time to launch a two-fold world champion Matti Great-Hamar's sports campaign?
We'll see about it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari hasn't conquered all the tops he wanted.
Next year, there's a big target.
In a year, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We're going to go get the medals!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey explored the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Fathers from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's government does not see a change in Syria's conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency chain, clarified the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the views and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey explored the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, the study consisted of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think that they would return to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the most affected are the war in Syria and the presence of Fathers in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war as the most impressive factor in the permanent return, while the fourth thinks it would be important for Fathers to leave the country.
Only less than one-quarter places the most important factors in the decision on improving the economic situation or leaving Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action does not resolve the conflict alone
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in the end of the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter of Al-Assad's presidency is an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half experience the need for political and military solutions to put an end to the current Syrian conflict.
The resolution of the conflict by means of military actions alone does not believe but a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see Father's power deteriorated over the last year, while fifth is experiencing its power strengthened.
According to respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Fathers, and generally against terrorism, is that the media should provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures and education reform as a priority.
A fair tenth believes that the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
Asking about the impact of Trump's regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's period.
The opinions are divided into two with regard to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the internet in order - the database he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the database of the "most growing world" open source code.
The main product of MariaDB, created by the coding company Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not pay users anything, and it can be developed via the Internet by any leading programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are Finnish database users, but not necessarily paying customers.
Through databases, huge data masses remain in order and rapidly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"Every information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time encoding.
A man who does remote work from beautiful hands will contribute to ensuring that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with MySQL in conjunction with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun purchased MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later Oracle left the software to squander Sun for a total of 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle trade took place, much of the developers of MySQL reported leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the best 20 developers from Sun and ensured the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The Foundation was established to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"Those assurances were not made during MySQL," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar store, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"The last few years, our growth rate has been around 50 per cent a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, focusing on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is a few words from the company's figures.
In this amount, he reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are ready to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may be a more than one year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The MySQL exchange to MariaDB will succeed in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest DBS bank in South-East Asia are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest teleoperators, gaming companies, banks and even a bank," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP on their closed databases.
Even Oraclelle MySQL is modest in comparison to the company's traditional closed database.
According to Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, however, in terms of turnover, gamblers like MariaDB are still negligible, although rapidly growing sines.
About $50 billion in the database market, the open source code databases do not uphold even a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for openness at that time or at least the transition would have been initiated.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most of them will choose the following open source code.
This has led to commercial database licensing fees jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they did with a smaller number of customers," Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, most of the customers have swallowed price increases in a sound manner.
"There are a lot of customers to whom the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are locked in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is getting full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer moves sooner or later to the open source code database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies face major system changes when transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many people exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth financing ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now going to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalen.
Widenius is upset about how money is spent in Finland on closed health care systems, such as when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that it itself cannot or can do.
The 55-year-old Widenius belongs to the promoters of another Finnish, Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, and the most well-known open source code.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models on an open source code.
I still have 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy's strong attitude to non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that will rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they are committed to complying with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities," said the Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in the interview of the Thursday La Stampa newspaper.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the vessel of the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of cooperating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
For a year alone, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives for us is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that at the moment we are unable to act in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in its opinion in the social media.
"We can only evaluate the accusations after we have gathered all the necessary information and we can assess the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had monitored the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees directly from human smugglers who have re-used the boats by boat.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the coast of Libya, and the information is reflected in the prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors the rescue operations in the area.
According to the operating instructions, ships such as Iuventa should be involved with an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the instructions: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who declared that he considered new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct are Nobel-paid Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for its part, said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy through rescue measures has been sharply lowering over the past few weeks, which he considers to be a sign of the fact that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local city leaders are beginning to produce results.
"The last few days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He highlighted the plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan city leaders on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The seasonal offender is suspected to have killed his open mate at Enontekio, the suspect was found in the country, a case to the prosecutor.
The suspect's crime took place in Enontekio's Kuttases last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish single-family.
Previously, they've been told that they were both seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have fled to the ground with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found cold on the ground, and he did not resist when he took it.
We'll have to file charges in less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in Lap District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and All Hairy My Friends, is dead.
British actress Robert Hardy is dead at the age of 91.
The actress' death was announced on Thursday by this family.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his career as an actress at a 24-year-old theatre.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the All Hairy My Friends TV series based on James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was described in a total of seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages that led to suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years for text messages and calls that she was considered to enthusiast her boyfriend to the suicide of Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy sweater, listened to his sentences on the cross with a weeping look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown regret."
Carter's lawyer said the case was because of "the disturbing circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that "the age or maturity level of Carter and even mental health problems did not have a significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. read Lynn Roy's statement of Conrad's mother, saying that "it's not a day before I mourned the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I get through all this. I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that he's "only" thinking that he'll never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born. It's never sore," Camdyn said.
The case appears to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car to be intoxicated in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had induced his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Shut yourself up, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy over the two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter called attention to Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knoxi's opinion statement, stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Interferences with Russia the worst since the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented the Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that the NATO relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the illegal accession of Krimi in 2014 and due to the continued instability in the Russian East Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not shake its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's remarks, President Donald Trump was able to say that the US-Russia even went to a dangerously poor level.
Trump called on the country to thank the poor congress, which last week adopted new anti-Russian sanctions.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the backlash experienced by car manufacturers
Day before Aud's announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
BMW's leader said that the company believed that "there are even more reasonable options than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including the home town of BMW, Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a re-call.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve carbon emissions targets.
Diesel engine emissions of nitrogen oxide are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for emissions-neutralising equipment are rising, making cars difficult to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been charged with the sympathy of large car companies and the neglect of problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen installed fraud devices in cars that reduced emissions to compliance with the regulations in tests.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director responsible for thermodynamics of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Previously this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, which was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the proportion of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela's vote began a fraudulent investigation, big demonstrations under promise
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election outcome, said Tibisay Lucena, President of the National Electoral Board, to the journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a representative was elected in a controversial vote on Sunday to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they will be in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began to take over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday night.
Forces are meant to ensure the safety of the appointment event.
Climate Change Threats Provencen Laventel
Laventels have become a symbol in the Provence region of Southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventeli had declined due to drought and disease-borne insects. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventeli is directly threatening in the Provence region, because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, leading to a sharp decline in the number of rainfall in spring and in particular in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This shortens the lavender's lifetime.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small bags in the area that spread microbacterials."
The stakes are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient of perfume and cosmetics.
"Instead of small stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are completely missing," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are less and less elements containing essential oil."
Solution is sought by increasing watering, slowing soil moisture evaporation and injecting plant-protecting clay and water mixing. In addition, the development of drying varieties that are more durable.
The murder of a journalist presents a growing threat in Mexico
The publication of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the State of Sinalo.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which one is safer: leaving children home or taking them into the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names for each group. No evidence is needed, no observations and no knowledge is sufficient.
The table includes names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on government or drug cartel paylists, who are criminals who make Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of the Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. In the past year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The popularity of the building of Riodoce covers a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice." Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have dressed in T-shirts that are decorated by the smiled face of Valdez. Valdez has eye glasses and a panama hat formed as a brand.
The meeting will be held less than two months after the death of Valdez, and the journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoidism of their excelled fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established, particularly for the treatment of journalists' cases, but the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has stated that only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, as do thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, but only a few end up in court.
Riodoce's journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little benefit because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the reason for the event."
Valdez had left Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan in the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had driven in his red Toyota, only a couple of blocks away, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposed to be related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove out in Valdez's car and hit it a few miles away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn his wife and two grown-ups.
The rumors are moving fast and they're floating freely in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a rat.
Sinalo has been the most bloody battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey graveyards of drug barons that are larger than many households.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published the interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a competing group that goes to war with the Guzman boys.
The case may have upset Guzman's boys: the suspects who were members of the gang bought each issue as soon as the paper came to the sales points.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another publication of the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had done a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The newspaper shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the paper began to feel courageous and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard - study journalism without fear of censure, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for the courage to follow the Mexican drug trade story without delighting.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received a journalists' protection committee prize.
The drug trade is "the way of life" in Sinaloa, Valdez said at the Rompeviento TV interview last October.
"The performer must accept a fallacious task for him — or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
The staff of Riodoce need Valdez – a joker who cursed like a harbour worker. They need a friend who always got a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always used a panama hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and sat on the same table all the time.
Now they're asking if the routines came into his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to wonder how they can best do their work and stay alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking trails.
They were left out of business," Bojorquez says.
Even in the best case, it meant strong self-sensitivity and self-protection,
trusting your own instincts.
If it feels like it's not all right, we have to stay away.
According to Riodoce's reporter Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the impression can be deceived, and so was the case with Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive routes of smuggling, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
No mobile phones were allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only spy programmes sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had been picked up in the shade of the tree for protection from 40 degrees of heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four - blocked building in the middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some of the reporters thought half of their playing whether these two policemen belonged to the 50 percent group that the state governor did not consider to be reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by the drug gangs.
In this week's number, Riodoce's delivery made three main cases.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinalo.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's use of money had focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to move forward with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was both popular with drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the powerful Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has ruled Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases of widespread publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of them "El Chapo" son Guzman managed to escape and avoid the military ride.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would have received reliable information from the Valdez column about kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says Villarreal, 46 years old, who has received the name "El Flaco" because of his body structure.
"Now all connections to our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse that preserves signs and labels against persecution of journalists. The newspaper workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become journalists who drive the freedom of the press.
On leaving the next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took along a few signs for a demonstration by the local prosecutor's office, which was the reason for the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests performed by the authorities, by Adame.
The journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country. The "SOS Press" texts appear in the foot corridors and buildings.
Today, President Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from the government cases, because he is concerned that he cannot be objective with anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico surrounded organized crime, authorities that allowed crime and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also being killed by the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Article 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were caused by police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a depressing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of Tamaulipas border six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas cartel at his body, "I'm here for my writings."
There was a computer keyboard and hearing aid next to his cut-off head.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in northern Chihuahua border State, correspondent Miroslava Breach after the March murder.
Some will continue their activities, such as New Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 the Journal de Ciudad Juarez published a message on its front page for drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their states or from the whole country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and we have to keep an eye on it all the time.
Sometimes the criminals are looking for the journalist, as apparently was the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 three months after he had escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who once had to become a poet, admits that the writing of a drug deal is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, on Friday night, Riodoce's journalists sat in front of the delivery with a footway beer when the newest issue of the magazine had been completed, and suddenly their phones began to color as a sign of a message.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed at Mazatlan's beach site.
The war aggravated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website on their smartphones.
The front page had to be reset the next day.
The sirens burst in the vicinity — another shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked at the delivery of guarded cops:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued with the tradition of the murdered founder under this massive picture where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider stopping the operation. "How could I shut down the paper when our interns asked us to go to the street to do a case on the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project started with a huge backlash - "Nice place"
The Hannu Mannise party, who was 39 years old in April, was short because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympics season.
However, the practice period began catastrophicly when Manninen became ill with flu.
It began a long period of sickness, which ran almost five weeks.
May went practically completely ill.
First there was a flu and finally a childhood disease like an ear infection to which I had to eat an antibiotic cavity.
I was only able to do 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't use the practice, Manninen tells the Night-Sannis.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was shown in the KIHU roller-free test of the Competition and Top Sports Research Centre of 12 June.
At the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet with speed growing every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the rug stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingernails on the needle.
Last fall, I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I'm only 28 minutes.
A fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In the Better Direction
After the initials, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have done several peaceful aerobic exercises in which I have sought to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week episode behind us.
It was also a 15-week vacation for air-training.
I was able to go to a cabin with my family, too.
Last year, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Households.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition when Manninen rose on top skiing to the 18th.
Guideline drawn
Manninen and Country Team Chief Coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
Now we're looking for a different rhythm compared to practice last season.
After the first race, Ruka would have the weekend of three world cups.
In December, it was meant to be part of at least one of the weekends of the World Cup, perhaps Ramsaus.
At the end of January, the plans would still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be found on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be Manniselle's sixth winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, Salt Lake City 2002 gold at the team competition celebrated the nummel underline.
Dinosaurus was protected from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first research results of the sarviculum-size creature found by a Canadian mining worker, which had been so well maintained that experts call it Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that scientists were even able to define that its fiery skin was red brown and had had a "problemful past".
According to the current biology magazine, it has been the best preserved armored dinosaur and representatives of its best species in the world.
Recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which was in the mid-East period 110–112 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the best preserved fossil has been in its species.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to look into his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's royal paleotological museum.
There the beast was excavated for six years from a quarter of a hundred kilos.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you shine your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science the dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies found that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and it resembled a walking tank.
Its red-white armor masked its predators, and it also protected a darker and lower-white color, which continues to occur in many animals.
Experts say it was so better able to mix up with its environment and avoid its enemies, greater dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the titles in May, and is now exhibited in the royal paleotological museum of Tyrrell.
The researchers have named it "Borrealop" by Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig the dinosaur out.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the team of international researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's reservoirs and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring in which the body is lighter and lighter.
The observation was a surprise, however, because Borealop is significantly greater than the present animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs who eat meat preyed it to the extent that evolution favours survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
Of today's animals, for example, peuros, zebras and armadillos have similar coloring, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier catches, indicating that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The catch of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the union period were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaurus veins reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions of its life, including the content of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
The researchers believe that it fell into the river when it died and went into the sea where it sunk on the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as Florida today, and the rivers and seas were likely to reach far further than today.
"This nodosaurus is really important because of its flavouring leather has been preserved and it has also remained three-dimensional in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early season
It doesn't require much imagination: if you shine a little eye, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
The period was the age of the teropodes, the huge two-foot dinosaurs that eat meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years before Borealopel, its mighty predecessors have captured this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus predecessors of Rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11.5 meters long six tons of monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe that Borealop was washed into the sea after his death and mutilated into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has been the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with leather and armor to the trunk.
Nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
There were two half-metre spikes from their stages.
Researchers believe that this armoured vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has kept small details in the underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains have been maintained so well that its skin remains on the armor's holes along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "as rare as lottery gain.
The more you look at it, the more astonishing it feels.
There's still fossilised leather on the holes of its skull pocket.
Its right front leg is on its side, five feet up.
I can also count the flakes of that foot base."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: To whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment in bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
Confusingly, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The name of the user belongs to a rapist living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old Black Brown in Ferguson in Missour State.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later the same night, people were told that they were collecting their phones to Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police lockdowns and screaming people, and of Brown's man who claimed to be his father, who was carrying a sign, saying, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police were standing in front of the demonstrators with a dog who snatched.
He says he also saw a video where another policeman turned his rifle and yelled, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalls.
"It wasn't a murder we've already used to and could be called a typical one.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 p.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets?" was made. It received its first night at the cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson's flower dress and its matching crown with his daughter, they reverted to the discussion of "they have to live in black and in what circumstances." They had spoken of it innumerable times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have been forced to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave her with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of this day are the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow up to it.
He must have the capacity to act and organize, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of black living, and he must know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect him from gross racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists, waiting for information about the case and eventually found out that there would be no charge against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughters went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in the bags and distributed them to the demonstrators.
Ferrell gradually began to view activists in a new way.
"Activistmini changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at Missour University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Nursing Students' Association of Minorities. He then focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "they simply wanted to tell," what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
The background of the suspicion was those innumerable times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folaya recently told us in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folaya had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity in the case of death sentenced prisoners.
The involvement of Davis led Ferrell to go to the project together with six other locals, and the shooting team followed the events that followed Brown's shooting in the years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis says.
"The most important thing to me was how local people are presented in the movie, because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was intended to show that the movement "is not a charismatic leader, but a community."
That is why the document shows surprising private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story once and brings back to the centre the role of black queer women in the larger Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement matches the queer identity.
"Mustien queer women's leadership has kept the whole movement up," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything."
Folaya agrees: "The black women who really maintain the movement, among whom are many queer-women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for documentary "self-intended" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folaya says.
"But it is no coincidence that he was in the front line. Black queer women live in the cutting place of many things, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted from white cloth."
The news groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole, and he was convicted of blocking the motorway in the demonstration.
His description of the social political atmosphere of his home corners is short and central: "Confusion."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned out on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our solidarity is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable resemblance: an artist creates shape pictures of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has hung up in the middle of the exhibition space with white, black and brown faces that can be seen in more detail.
These 30 works are pictures made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair samples.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison where he performed his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of bleeding diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks site.
The Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and uranitarian opponent whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his office to the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Manning's DNA algorithmly and created 30 formats based on his genetic data, which are a sharp, though slightly theoretical, position on DNA data editability, multi-interpretation and underlying causal consequences and identity.
Chelsea Manning, named Bradley Edward, has been openly told that he has been in contact with women since the break-in. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning convicted in prison: a granular, black-white selfie, where the troubled Manning sits in the car driver's place. He has a platinum ball wig in his head, which became his sign.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a big popular Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
There he created pictures on the basis of technical data, and he received DNA data from, for example, cigarettes and cigarettes, and he created pictures of what people could have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their case," Dewey-Hagborg told me at the new exhibition.
He couldn't come to Manning and he couldn't be filmed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA screenshot.
The artist and his incarcerated music suddenly became comrades of correspondence, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Suppressed Images comic book, which Shoili Kanungo imagined, depicting a future in which the President would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven years of imprisonment.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump visits his own war against data spillers and transgender soldiers and is still finding new ways to strengthen the powerful chaos he had to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everyone has his purpose."
The gallery wall has an artist's statement and under it Manning's great autograph, where the name i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been founded".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA cycle: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a lead pen.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to see how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are identical from our genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also presents his Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them here."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: page of Manning's and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, in his hand a megaphone.
"If they make you quiet, they have won," says the picture.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning hasn't seen the exhibition yet. When Manning shows up, he was greeted by his own genetic data as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like all the others in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA episode is written with a lead pen at a height that is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
"The plants were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them when they felt," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to take a picture of Chelsea's mass movement, which was also behind his release."
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are wanted for murder as suspects
Police report launching national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The documents of Cook County Court show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, and arrest warrants have been issued for the first degree of murder without the possibility of bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he had been stabbed several times.
According to the local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Service, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several cut-off wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and stabbing was investigated as a murder.
Lathem has been working at the University of Nortwestern since 2007 as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology.
Deputy Director for Social Relations of the University, Alan K. Cubbage, said by e-mail, in his statement, that Lathem is now on a free administrative basis and has been banned from accessing Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University helps in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent as a financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement sent by the University and Somerville College by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Mr Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Mr. Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Service, said he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The politicians have an idea of their whereabouts, and we keep checking our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the searches of suspects.
He reported that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene as horrific.
Guglielm says it's unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published to the residents the following press release: "It would be necessary to investigate the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill the Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the library staff alerted them on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had been "happy to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events in the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in bookstore events, the police reporter said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the cops in interrogation.
As a penalty, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay £620, or approximately €690, legal expenses and £85, or approximately €95, compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's reporter, a number of hate crimes are not reported.
"We will finalize WADA Roadmap activities in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, has said that Russia will soon complete the WADA road map of the World Anti-Doping Office to restore the powers of RUSADA of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"A part of the road map measures have already been taken and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in this respect," he said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the roadmap was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mr Mukot, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been reported, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the points of the road map requires that the Russian antidoping authorities accept publicly the results of the investigation by WADA, a Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, and McLaren investigates the alleged state's share of Russian sports doping.
That is what Mutko said: "The investigation is under way because our antidoping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we cannot admit that there was no such thing."
But there were echoes in the words of Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian independent public antidoping commission.
Previously on the same day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media, admitted that there have been problems in the Russian antidoping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA's leader Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow. After his visit, he found that the organization was on the "right road" towards restoring powers.
British Sceptical Association for Finnish Dear Innovation: The Health Benefits of Mother Packages "There's No Evidence"
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust organization that fights against hidden deaths prohibits the use of its own brochures in the UK from being distributed in motherhood packages.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women begins this month in Scotland.
In England, the packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package would reduce the risk of hidden death.
Hidden death means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust serves as an expert in British health authorities in the field of children's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because it would make it understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland is one of the lowest child mortality readings in the world, only two dead per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is a result of a number of different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that a box is given to every family there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure, said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
Motherhood packing is a Finnish invention and has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
Packaging contains various items such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The pack itself is a carton box in which a child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes that it has distributed meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cartons.
Lullaby Trust suggests that the package may be the best place to sleep if there is no frame or surface bed available.
The organization recommends that you use the package only for your sleep and stop using it at the stage when your child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä konna escaped from a Japanese zoo again
The Japanese zoo personnel are looking for a runaway turtle.
As a giant turtle, the staff have been surprised at their speed and have already escaped to repeat in two weeks.
Shibukawa's zoo in Western Japan in Okayama escaped on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the conna left the zoo through the entrance.
It doesn't die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we're very worried, told by Yoshimi Yamane working in the zoo.
Karannut 35-year-old conna is female, 55-kilometre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and mild.
During the opening hours, the conna is free to travel in the area of the corn.
The zoo hasn't received eyewitness findings from the tortoise.
The last escape of Kona happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in their online business startup, but the questions did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were unnamed, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," Errett explains. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on online trade. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on outside aid.
The market has become more and more new types of staff management start-ups that help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure the commitment of workers; companies can ask questions and target them to certain teams and population groups and offer unnamed notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the government.
"Your own health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO Jim Barnett of the Glintstartup located in Redwood City. Glint offers business analytics software for measuring employee commitment.
Errett has been using Glint software for three years, and he says he's gained a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map that can be seen with one eye in which departments the workers are more unhappy and which of the leaders have received the weakest assessments, based on which Errett has been able to get into the core of problems.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of employment so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has been overwhelmed since a former worker wrote on his blog about culture where workers are being harassed and punished by problems.
For startups like Glint, such neglects are an attractive business opportunity.
Business management, regulation and conformity are a global sector that can be valued by Let's Talk Payments website to more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent misuse. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation hit a collage.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It has recently concluded a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make tailored surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may inappropriately report the unresolved behaviour by means of a text message.
And if there's a reason to suspect the leader of misconduct, the complaints will go directly to the company's government.
"The general opinion has excluded the authorities," says Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees poorly or acts unethically, the consequences may become expensive even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start booing the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged to justice.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 establishments. The company has used Convercent over a year because it wants to ensure that workers are aware of policies and procedures and are easily contacted with the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that he was able to report to the main office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's lawyer director James Vitrano. He said it was difficult to track complaints made by workers.
Previously, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and handled faster.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the worker," says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from working relationships.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take a more serious approach to ethics, values and employee commitment after Arthur Andersen's audit firm collapsed as a result of unethical activity in the context of Enron Scandaal.
Only through social media did companies understand that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly cleared.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethics control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and possibility accepted by capital investors, both Glint and Convercent have capital investors to support.
In February, Convercent collected $10 million of funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has collected a total of 47 million dollars.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected funding totalling $60 million.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers are expecting more of their jobs in the past.
In competitive markets such as the Hidden Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely beneficial company.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of the LinkedIn company responsible for workers' remuneration and well-being.
Investors will receive profits when companies succeed. Enterprises will succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen workers' commitment, so it's no wonder they're interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, information on the commitment of workers is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken.
If an undertaking asks its employees for feedback, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of the management company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on simply collecting information.
"If the company does not take action, workers will start to wonder if they became heard.
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated workers on the slowness of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands his employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help him to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in the industry known for the high variation of workers.
"If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no businesses."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of encrypting his naked female mask, reports TT News Office.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed her cell phone hanging outside her window at the end of the rope.
The woman says the cell phone camera shot the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon thereafter counted back into the window.
A 20-year-old man who was suspected of being encrypted has admitted he's taken a picture of a woman.
However, he claimed that he only photographed the face of a woman.
The video on the phone had been removed, and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In interrogation, a man has admitted the act, but he has denied that he committed a crime.
The man who described him had reasoned by saying that he loves his neighbor, "Aye crazy."
According to the TT News Office, a man is charged with the case.
Teachers demand more liquid in the autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than the export industry, for example, but the difference should be reduced, said Olli Luukkainen on Thursday, President of the OAJ.
The temporary surgery of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he notes.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would in some way not involve any holiday cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be made after the private sector documents have been signed and the rates of increase are clear.
It is predicted that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luke hasn't revealed yet.
It is also chaired by Juko, a publicly trained negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday-money surgery increases earnings differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is decreasing while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the plutonium, periodic holiday surgery is a major factor in earnings development.
In Finland, how many pupils per teacher can be
In addition, OAJ points out that equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the system, learning results are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of Bruins' players was my last day when NCAA reduced daily exercises for two together
It's about 11:00 p.m., a bunch of UCLA football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus.
Some of them have stripped their game shirt, and their backs are shining out of the sand in the practice camp after the first day of the raid.
For a lot of them, this talk talk for a few minutes is a noon break.
At the university's summer courses, players who study will return after three hours of rehearsals to the apartment room to read the final exams. The next morning they will meet at 7:30 in the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days will be hard for these friends," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The Overschool Sports Agency reduced the number of daily exercises to two in one. The change was intended to reduce the number of players' work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That's why the three first exercises in UCLA started over 15 nights. It was difficult for players to find space from the full schedule.
The limitation of training reports in one day means that the days of exercise are more than ever before. The camp began this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Mora has spent six years in the Westwood training period, while the exercises are held at the same time with the summer courses.
Exercises are to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening season begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported NCAA's rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We really load them a lot for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think it'll make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view of the exercise camps to the nearby parking area and the Lusk Center, a flat hotel that has already been bombed with overflying footballs.
Bruins players are meant to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"It is a matter of concern that people can book a room and film there exercises for the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
It's a lot of money to pay for the video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and parking area.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, in Central Africa, Presidential elections will be held, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking for his third period, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
At that time, the RPF rebel group ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was RPF commander.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to seek, as the constitution of the Presidency has been amended for two years.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have taken place and international investment has flown.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in combining the land of genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether a liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom since the earth has been lifted up.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by stepping up fact-finding
Facebook intends to send possible false news to more and more independent fact-inspectors and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news will be sent to the fact-finners and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the largest disseminators of false news. Many believe that the false news influenced the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with false news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to finite social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the factual checks are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what stories do not pass the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share," Facebook's Product Manager Sara Su wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the articles related to the topic and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Birth of a series book: The story of a castle
The Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known as Squeeze's music video and as Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppis-haired writer of old documents.
"It's great to be able to study the text written by more than 300 years ago by a dead person," Rhodes says incredibly.
"I know a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian period. Each story has imagined a different artist, a promising British comic bookwriter: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes archives. In 2014 he appeared Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved into tears when I saw a thumbprint in a letter, and the letter had written a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time the light was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Arts Council of England, which felt too good to be true.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarenesses, such as hyenaheads hanging on walls and bottles of centuries of whale.
He circled over the ruins and premises of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also record the pictures of artists.
At night, he "taken whiskey and started writing."
The closest history of Scotney is quite unknown, as the castle completely moved to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were just beginning to pass through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years with the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
There were newspapers in the archives, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that the land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here, however, families fought even for a single squirrel.
It came to mind that we might already be allowed to be."
Some of the stories of the book are moving from the castle to the history of England, as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon joined the castle after graduation to the British homeless rebellion in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mention that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"England's peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could start from a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a story of the priesthood that Darrell's family hid seven years during the cleansing of England's religion.
The Smuggler again tells the smuggler of Arthur Darrell's story from the 17th century. He is said to have set up his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been a lot of slayers, and they kept on getting into their debts and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by marrying the wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who could squeeze the heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Lifemäki, a healing facility in the early 1900s, where only an honest land remains.
Scotney's castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this damn thing yet."
You're the worst in Russia since the cold war.
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented the Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that the NATO relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the illegal accession of Krimi in 2014 and due to the continued instability in the Russian East Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not shake its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's remarks, President Donald Trump was able to say that the US-Russia even went to a dangerously poor level.
Trump called on the country to thank the poor congress, which last week adopted new anti-Russian sanctions.
Vladimir Klitshko stops the re-enactment against Anthony Joshua will not take place.
The long-term champion Vladimir Klitshko of the heavy world series of professional racing ends his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Klitshko, who hit gold, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64.
He held various MM accounts in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit her score in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and lost after the fierce fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rerun in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the fight.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitshko told me when he spoke.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and unbelievable successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's arguments for its decision in the video.
Klitshko's manager, Bernd Bönte, reported that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has dated the American actress Hayden Panettier since 2009.
The couple have one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former world champion of the heavy series.
During the years 2008-12, the brothers ruled the MMs of different alliances at the same time.
The weather breaker in Finland follows the following conditions: "Stick out of the fiil"
Minna Nikkanen, a sewer jumper, has suffered from conditions during the summer's outdoor irony season.
Minna Nikkase has had a problem with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have been taken from a woman's file.
There are unstable conditions in London's World Games.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been this supreme wall jumper against Minna Nika.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was unbelievable that I couldn't even get the little walls to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here in the way of how many times and have never experienced this place as varied the wind, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardisation of the jump has been very difficult, even in the exercises there have been such unstable winds, Nikkanen said in the Kaleva races.
The weather was talking in London on Thursday.
Time has been challenging to get the technology together... whether it's a cold god, or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the fiil.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He got his control jump 455 thanks to the MM contest.
It's gone 445 outside.
We don't all have the same relationship in London.
We have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The objective is to exceed Friday's 460.
Why don't you just train abroad?
That's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got a jump together and technically standardized.
I guess I should have done the same right now.
Normally he's gotten into the hall to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would it be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
It's a little wind as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-efficiency scolded politicians up, "We don't have any room for distribution now and for many years."
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in the hat and warn the government's budget to be squeezed with debt money, warns the budgets of Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for distribution.
In 2015, Yle interviewed retired from Power in Wednesday to 9th in the morning.
The construction of the next year's government budget is just beginning.
Recently, proposals by politicians on the lifting of the guarantee pension, the calculation of the car tax and the support of electric bikes, including Mr Virtanen, are being held as an election speaker.
They mainly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by an additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the dividend when you owe me, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts owed to children.
The current has a long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started as Secretary of Budget at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Budgetary Head.
The last time he retired, he was the head of the Ministry of Labour and Industry.
In the Yle interview, Virtanen noted that the forecast economic growth of 3 % is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a spike from which we will be going to the submarine next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase for decades.
Washington amends the rules of the permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump reported that the rules of the permanent residence permit, namely the Green Card, are being amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to sustain themselves and have beneficial skills in our economy," Trump said according to the media.
The Danish queen's wife doesn't want to be buried in the same place with the queen
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaretha.
In the picture Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree were shot in April.
The Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and his wife, Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried next door, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, sovereign couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's Room has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the prison of Roskilde, the court observes when he communicated on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family is the reason for this.
There is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, commenting on the newspaper by the Court of Justice Chief Lene Belleby.
The prince's decision not to be buried alongside the queen is the natural consequence of not being treated equally with his spouse.
According to Hov, the queen has long been aware of the desire of her husband for the burial site and understands the decision.
The moment of terror on the road: the car was coming on the motorway
Tom had an open mate and two little kids on board.
They didn't get hurt in an accident, but they won't get the money from insurance if the other side is not targeted.
The accident occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
File photo from the building site of Kehä III.
Vantaalainen Tomi tells me his family survived on Tuesday at a miracle store in a car accident.
Tomi, her open-minded wife Riina and two little children of the couple drove on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vantaella Hämeenlinna.
A white car that was driving to the side of the family's car, Tomi tells us, was driven along an acceleration band from the connection to the Hämeenlinna.
Without the fugitive movement, the car would have gotten onto Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tom tells me.
The family's car was hit by a heavy speed on the bench.
The parents and the back seats had two little children that were not injured.
One of the children is slightly under 3 years of age, the other under a year of age.
Looks like it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed by didn't even drive us, even though there was a vibrant traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at around 5:20.
Tomore said no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own strength.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue facility came in, and the family's fitness was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tom tells us that he and a single mate have small incomes, and they received assistance for the purchase of a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family won't get the money from Tommi's insurance.
That's why the family hopes that witnesses will find out about the car that led the family to the bar.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the garden and work without it, Tom says.
Tom saw that the car was white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 2000s.
He thought the car's registration number was the start of SIG.
If the perpetrator doesn't get caught, I don't know how we're gonna manage financially, we're gonna have to count every inch nowadays.
Tommi hopes that what happened or what they know is connected to the police.
It is confirmed from the Eastern New Country Police and the Central New Country Rescue Agency that they have had a mission at the accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and case were corrected at 21:15: Unlike the case originally reported, the other car did not come from the front line, but was driven from the acceleration band to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppisen's directed performance deals with human relations by means of humour - A self-developer sees what? at the theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-time guidance to what? Theater.
The revealer himself is a music theater of misrepresentation of past human relationships and inadequacy.
Director Lotta Jäppisen says it'll still be a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
I don't think you're gonna stay in the way of the bad feelings, he says.
The tour of the summer theater has been carried out with a spicy budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges to consider what a person reveals himself to a new person when he meets.
Maybe he's pulling a role, or is he approaching another coat open?
Juoneless performance mixes fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatically dramatized the show.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the Working Group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that even though the performance arouses the thoughts of young people, it speaks of all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the self-developer does not directly tell about his own or the human relations of the working group.
The fact and fiction are mixed up.
I'm sure my own world of value cares about the show.
I do not think that human relations would be bad, but I do not think that the human relationship, especially the relationship, would be a happy condition.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland, who are 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned much from their parents' relationships, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay with a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka play.
The task force also includes the costumer Ella Snellman.
The music arrangement is Yappisen and Roka.
Love in the theater burned in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, 26 years old, studies as the theater expression director at the University of Art of Turku.
It's two years behind, and there's another mokoma ahead.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun over the years of Kouvolan.
The educator of music classes has been an assistant to Kouvola's theatre and played at, among others, the High School Theatre in Helsinki and last in the Linnateatter in Turku.
Guidance has become more and more interesting.
Last week, a self-developer received his first night in Helsinki at Narr's scene.
A 45-minute show was also seen in the future, at least in the city of Jäppinen, Turku.
Self-developed at Kouvolan What? Theatre 4.8 at 19:00 and 5.8 at 14:00 and 19:00.
The Finnish Olympic Winner recovered for a year from the terrible motocrosson accident.
Few athletes in Finland are the same unstopable nature power as Janne Lahtela.
At the collaborator's landing, he traveled the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream about the Olympic Gold.
The dream was realized in 2002, but the Lahtila movement continued.
He was not only an untiring practitioner, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably no many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtila tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahti completely.
In 2014 Lahtila was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neckline and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds at my house for a year, Lahtila says.
The lake had bad luck.
He also admits that age could have been a part of the misdemeanor.
You know, driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't get the limits on it.
It's just as a species so hard that it's not worth doing too much of this 40-year-old!
After the accident, Lahtila was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind it was a long start to the Japanese freestyle country team as the main coach.
Lahti started in the bait immediately after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtila tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtila often challenged its protectors in the chest and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that even my own thoughts didn't seem reasonable.
Not even with a species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtila as the principal coach in Finland.
Without a stop, he's afraid he'd be burned.
It's easier for Croatia to find places that have been cut apart than intact!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtila started the Finnish freestyle country team as a coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby instead of speeders.
I switched motocross to frisbeegolf!
It just got out of the way right now.
The worst I ever had was seven hours a day to throw.
Although the Lahti itself has always been a superintendent trainer, he does not demand that he be trained to be similar to him.
I'm not gonna force everyone into the same fashion.
In our species culture there is room to be one's kind and ways to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtila says.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on technology developments in the sex robot industry – just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer become weirder.
Yes, I do.
The sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within 5 to 10 years.
"We must begin to take a serious look at the spread of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and the robotic and artificial intelligence emeritus professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the type of color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the fingernails.
"Sex-robots are being squeezed, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them more," Sharkey said in the publicity report.
Sex dolls have evolved from blowing dolls to robots with warmest-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human use.
The user can also adjust the robot to his own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and color of the fingernails.
It is also more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedommakers.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shy.
The Roxxxy Gold Robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is an adventurer and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", advertises the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different areas of mind:
It may be tired, with the wind of the story, or with the wind of it.
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the submissiveness of women and direct rape fantasies, when the user approaches, for example, a shy and opposing robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development tells us of something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where submission is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to generalize at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and in the White House there is a president who has been harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying of its powerful illustrative language, for example images of the hanged bodies and the excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprising short journey there.
Sex robots are attempted to do as much as technically possible with real women (measurements of porn stars).
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
Robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They have neither their own will nor their own history — nothing to indicate independence or to violate the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasing servants.
A slave.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the team was led by the Chief of Fathers
The Head of the Issis Extreme Organization led the group of Australian men who are suspected to have planned to take the bomb into the aircraft of the Etihad Airways company.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person of father's leadership characters had also sent to Sydney bomb builders.
The suspects said the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell you more exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas excretion device and to take the device into a filling place in public, for example, a public transport facility.
Assistant Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney show a healthy sense of life
Since the Trump season, it has already been repeated that the strong caste of voters has also broken up families.
In the course of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of the American newspapers guided how to get along with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to blow up our information bubble.
Lower attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was in my house this week in New York, and he's a poet of leftist spirit living in Chicago, who's been on the right side with the Republicans in our family for a long time.
He recalled that the common enemy could have a strong connecting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all know, including the republican-supporting sister with whom he has been discussing politics for decades, are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
On the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more widely thought of, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation," we talk about the scary chance that one day we will no longer scare his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more horrible chance that Trump will normalize the right extremist Republicans who suddenly seem to be reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney's controlled version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and at least his tax returns we have seen), compared to Trump, they seem very mildly breaches.
When Trump's season is over, the next candidate for the Republicans needs only to be clear-minded, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best we can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
Karusell's horses are huge, middle characters — loose clowns and animals looking back on terror — are evil, and the sounding music on the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's symbols become disappointed over time: the sights of the high buildings are getting bored, the city's siluet becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not matching dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I've been completely out of the way that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large traffic circle in Northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it's not counted.
Rather, the carousel of the Central Park is still a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two of the two, one of the eleven, and two of the fourteen women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full scores if someone had asked for my assessment, but I'm glad no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the grocery store to evaluate my "experience of payment" scales from one to five stars before I put my credit card in the numerature.
The same thing in the cafeteria in my home corners, but there's also a chance for me to join the estimate of 15% of the service money when I go to get coffee from the desk myself.
This slows down the ark's interaction and pressures the customer server to put his or her person into a game in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman of the goods house smiled sorry for giving my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from Inter.
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's company from the role of coach.
Fabrizio Piccareta, former assistant coach, took responsibility for training.
The other training team will continue its current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as assistant coach in, inter alia, English Sunderland.
In January, a 51-year-old member of Interi training group, Piccareta, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
President of the FC Inter Government, Stefan Håkans, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the company's management, when there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the Society's communication.
The Piccareta agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to the News of the Night, the team's been shoving all the way down Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the company's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccaret strongly joined Inter's fight against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of youth in the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violin artist, Linda Lampenius, published a young picture in Instagram.
A number of constituencies have been added to the picture, which can be found to be a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's been communicating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful subjects.
Just a year ago, he posted a pair of pictures himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, they see him 20 years ago, in the other he possesses now, as a mother of two children.
In his illustration, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered when he was younger.
Twenty years ago, and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags of life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already 14 years old in the hospital because of his anorex and orthography.
A little later he also became ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing started a little slow.
In addition to therapy and peer-reference, Lampnius helped with new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital due to chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for the wristwatches he had in prison, according to the prison authorities, when he fell into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder for the original death sentence complained of by the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkampi during the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the WC door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to think his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the WC.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to retrieve, because they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too mild.
The U.S. Attorney intends to complain to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the sentence of Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the BTV channel.
The police arrested a number of unpromised camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced its release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and have already imposed substantial fines on all those camping in non-purpose areas.
The inspections shall be continued until the end of the period.
The Ministry stated that the court may impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinks - already declining -7.7 per cent
The oil processing company Nesteen's share has declined by 7.7 per cent at around 11 a.m.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate may relieve irritated intestinal syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare of the gastrointestinal system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a high diet containing meat protein and milk products may facilitate irritated intestine syndrome.
The irritated intestine syndrome is an unhealthy disease, suffering from about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or blood diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophane containing protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerability.
According to Marco Colonna, the immune cells guard the veins and ensure that the harmful microbes that are hidden in the food are not reached in the body.
Inflammatory cells balancing cells that strengthen tolerability, protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance decreases too close to inflammation, there may be an irritated intestinal syndrome.
Tests found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a certain bacteria in the intestine.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to begin to develop immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We have found a connection between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerability. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of normal intestinal microbiomy," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mouse diet had tryptophane, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a rich diet containing tryptophan may strengthen the intestinal tolerability and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In the study of tolerability-reinforcing immune cells, researchers, Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of rats had such cells, they did not have the same type of mouse that was kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to mice's intestinal microbiomes, that is, the normal gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, sensation and viruses.
When mice's intestinal DNA was investigated, six bacterial species were detected in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to sterile mice with no intestinal microbiome and no immune cells developed, immune cells began to occur.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and moved small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – to insulated immune cells.
Immune cells developed into more tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was cleansed from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in the diet of mice, the number of tolerability-consolidating cells increased by about 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal channel.
It is not yet known whether triptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cells develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritated intestine syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate intestinal inflammation on intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
‘The high level of tryptophane combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalisation.'
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "neeron" in line after a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United received a "neeron" in line after a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle-field player debytoi in Manchester United rows in a fight against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea at 40 million pounds, started a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last United race before the UEFA Super Cup tournament on Tuesday. He was impressed as a defending middlefield player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the tour of the blues in Asia before the beginning of the season. He managed on the field only 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there is a change to be made before the beginning of the season of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the incoming Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cool down its starting assembly for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the company has already done "splendid work" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four – it must be thankful to the company," he added.
"I'm more happy if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Aeroball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish Women's Balloon Country Team lost its fourth MM-Cursing tournament to Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level of playing is high.
Balanced their game was in every sector, Finland's main coach Tapio Kangasniemi told in the newsletter.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we were played patiently and in certain places sufficiently aggressively, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective of Finland was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three of the four defeated matches, Finland will meet again on Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: The Grand Jury already sent challenges to the Trump Jr Russia meeting
In the United States, the grand jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The great jury called upon by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump, a Russian lawyer known as the Kremlin, and Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information previously revealed by Wall Street Journal on the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr and Kreml, known as the Veselnitskaja, held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's then campaign leader Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current adviser to the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a major jury in Washington means that Russia's investigation has increased.
Sources add that Mueller wanted the grand jury to assist in an investigation that seeks to investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his neighbors cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify juryly.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence investigated by the prosecutor's investigation and decides whether the case should be brought.
The British inventor microcircuited himself to get home and into his car with his hand rolling.
The first British inventor in the whole country has micro-circuited himself so that he can open his home to the outside door, get to his office and start his car with a wrinkle of his hand.
Microchiru is 33 years old between Steven Northam's thumb and front finger. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with Northam BioTeq's technology.
Northam cooperates with the hospital consulting doctor Geoff Watson of the Royal Hampshire County in Winchester to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as for cats and dogs in microchips, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also change the locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microcircuit technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House Exhibition Exhibition paid thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The recent decision of the White House to fly the Marine helicopter to the southern lawn field of the White House into an American production event came to pay taxpayers $24,000. The information is reflected in the TIME magazine's military documents.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on its way. It was a bet for the event in the White House on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were acquainted with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the exhibitions included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The military office of the White House had requested the helicopter's location by mission order only about 36 hours before it landed in the southern lawn field for an "exceptional" event, which is evident from documents on the HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote the day before the event in an e-mail to his supervisor, who is the Deputy Commander of the Marine Air Force.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive in the southern lawn field at 17 July in the morning and the event began at 3 p.m. The helicopter would leave the site only after the lawn field was emptied at night between 6 and 9.
In addition, the message stated that if a helicopter left from the White House delayed, a second crew would be needed because of the limitations on hours of service.
The original crew was on the helicopter during the event, and the unit security personnel were at the helicopter when it was in the country.
The documents obtained from the TIME magazine will not make it clear whether another crew was eventually needed.
The United States Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 investigated whether the event was in breach of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this Hatch Act was violated. We were told that we were not being violated," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," replied the Deputy Commander.
Made in America was an official event in the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At that time, the president spoke in favour of the health reform at the Senate's hearing and of the weaker state regulations.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents shall use them on their journeys,
But their use for photographs alone is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled behind the President's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of its predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented the products produced by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," said the White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern lawn field to bring the president to the White House with accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 rehearsals for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the monthly training quota for the crew.
The unit's helicopters also flew on that day for 11 hours "non-Presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, the event did not result in any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's informant said that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to assess the exact costs of the event.
According to the 2017 hourly allowances of the Ministry of Defence, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24,380 per hour of flight.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the base of Quantico from the state of Virginia to the White House took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
‘The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called immersed costs, which are taken into account in annual appropriations.'
According to the RAND research company's 2015 report, compensation levels do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to present American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and probably employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence supplies for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is absolutely appropriate to bring it to light."
It's not sure if Trump was on the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down on the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

Venezuelan Public Prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of Venezuela
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative from the country.
President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has announced that last Sunday's vote was to appoint a representative on Friday.
The controversial vote elected a representative for the country, which could, among other things, change the Constitution of the country.
According to the Chief Prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent the elections has been called for on the grounds of misconduct.
Ortega has also started the vote on the polling poll.
He appointed two judges after the British company who held a representative vote reported that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the Allies of Maduro were candidates for the delegation, and the elected 545 members have, among others, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representative may break down the congress led by the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers that the reform of the Constitution is a means of strengthening Maduro's position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have indicated that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro argues that the new delegation is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, restlessness has continued for months.
Many people have been wounded and over a hundred are dead.
Venezuela fell into economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medication.
The opposition is also expected to show its opinion on Friday, when the new representative is to begin.
Russian handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court in the United States condemned Maksim Senah, 41 years of age, for nearly four years in prison, from being involved in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US demand.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was coming home.
Finland handed over Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, reports AFP News Office.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah got 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Finland loudly after the arrest and said that a man must not give up to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used the computer virus called Ebury, which was seized by tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish user names and passwords.
The scams then used the information by continuing to guide Internet traffic, which led to clicking and disseminating spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Criminal Department of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently published trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning as Javier Peña, who is recruiting US and Colombian police officers to war against drugs.
The new faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production season of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional artwork in Paris
A Joensuu illustrative artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional illustrative work in honor of the first day of light set by the UN in Paris next 16 May.
Kola is doing a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.

Timo Soin's question-marked article: "Afterwards there was a flood"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post that has been addressed with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that the flood came, now everything is rolling, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to France in the 17th century.
It is known that King Ludvig XV or this mistress Madame de Pompadour used water flooding.
Depending on the interpretation of history's books, the phrases "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood" have been left.
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are representative only if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN Afghan mission on Wednesday.
Mr Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Grant Mission, said that hundreds of women are on the nomination of the provincial councils, three women are seeking to be vice-president and more than 30% of the recently registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women participate fully in them and involve them in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential Elections shall be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to elections at the same time as the international forces are moving to a consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that the power moves peacefully from democratically elected government to government.
Haysom said that women's contribution strengthens Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Board, 1.2 million of the registered voters are women.

The flood of certain tourists threatens the region's culture
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the target is only a few hours and it is raided through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is stifled by rapid day trips to tourists to the city.
The narrow streets are hard to move and the fine openings are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre while in place of homes they have become hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon a poor-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours will be allowed.
You follow the flag guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes the tourism that prevails and causes problems for the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of the Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
Saint Mark's tower also belongs to the most popular attractions of Venice's historic centre.
At the tower's side is the church of Saint Mark.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to 50,000 locals.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians showed their minds against massaturism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years' time, there are no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe of the demonstration.
The same is difficult, as ships bring their earnings to Venice, and create the need for a number of different sectors of work.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been formulated for the cruisers to go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Venice, where Venice is also located, were to have more power to decide on its own matters - unless the full autonomy.
Around 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving in the Kuopio?
Bad congestions on the motorway
On the north-west road between the Kuopio and Siilin Lake, there have been several miles of traffic from work on Thursday afternoon during the return journey.
The area is carrying out motorway surface work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For roads there is a limit of 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h speed.
However, even in the 50 km limitation area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoons at practical walking speeds.
The roadworks went on Thursday afternoon on the side of Siilin Lake in the statue of Revelation, or the golden oatmeal.
I'm doing well without such attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of himself in the Grand Canyon landscape, among others.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Nordic athlete, has risen in his current home country in Norway as a popular athlete, not least because he broke the record of Norway in March 26 years old in a 400-metre run by roaming at the time of the round 51.81.
A month later, he healed at the time of the Norwegian record of a 400 - meter fence.
Shortly after his record, Iuel, who used social media, found that fame and publicity had its shadows.
Men around the world began to send pictures of their sexual body to Iuel apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account outside.
I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
In the VG interview, Iuel didn't want to accurately identify what pictures he got.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm doing well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, a Danish-Nordic father.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her father's job moved to Namibia, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than in the United States.
In the United States, trainers are not asking for anything, they are simply giving orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 meters and 400 meters in the fence.
The leg injury took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the risk of the entire career now in the MM contests: "It's nice not to hurt anything."
Now it's been nice to count when you haven't hurt anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, of the most successful snowmakers in Finland, has been able to enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the career continued at stake.
The pressure wound on the foot table had forced Korve to cut down in January, and the leg had no desire to heal.
The hand had also been hit by a rally.
In summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether or not the board went on.
The sponsorids were cut and a lot of things were open, says Korpi.
But that's what it says, it's the way things work out.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling back into the chest.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that no later than the first time I was in the snow.
I was like, hell, yeah, this is so funny again, let's pull a couple more through.
The corpse was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long bill, it's a big thing to do, just in painless training.
Kissing Korpi's only been around a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in the fever that week.
I can't think so, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi is racing at the half-pipe of the World Championships held in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Even though individual races don't like him on board, in hard company, he always burns up.
According to Korva, the appreciation of the races organized by the International Ski Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, I always think that appreciation depends on what kind of conditions and the level of races are.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-year-old team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to follow the way you're going with younger friends.
I remember when I was at the time that everything was new and was so sick about everything.
It'll bring you a new power, too, Corpi's thinking.
I'm still staying on the chest somehow, but by the way, no, that's enough for friends to flow!
In the background of the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sporting career.
The pilot legenda Pekka Korve son is glued to nutrient sports: the steward has his own nutrient horses for which he performs training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, it doesn't have any more time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at least the food results and usually some departures, says Korpi.
Rawling and nutrition training are, according to Korva, a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed in due course.
I'm not planning that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I'm going to experience it like I'm studying it with this snowfall.
I'm trying to stay nervous about time and develop, maybe in the summer I'll drive some departures.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already finished inside the species.
Ravine stories also include the Elitloppet ravilist organized by the composer Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will be heading towards the Elitloppet Ravine Competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Korpi and Linnonland decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has gone to a great deal, and people have been excited.
Now we're at the point that at least there's no bankruptcy.
A few months is more, hopefully full, says Korpi with enthusiasm.
Attendo's nursing project for Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-located nursing home for Kitee.
The building of over 1,700 floor meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the health center next door.
On the crystal, the general subject of wondering is the need for a new care unit for customers, because now, during the wars of You, many private care homes are popping up customer shortages.
The regional director of care services Anne Flink Attendo commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, even freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private care homes from Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The trade concerned business, but there is a five-year rental agreement on the properties.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to transfer functions from these premises.
More on the subject today later.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union will seek from the directors of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer to strengthen a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Department of the GMB of the UK General Trade Union, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products factory have over 500 employees.
The company owned by the McVitie's brand, Pladis, reported investing in the factory in over five million pounds in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives "will certainly be listed as the first ones" if changes are taking place.
In its letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company to "response to the concern that there is no funding for modernisation of production lines".
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is extremely concerned about the lack of clear information from the director of the factory on the needs of Tollcross' business and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from one generation to another, and the labour force has focused heavily on the local community and Glasgow's major city area. The factory is a major employee in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the point of view of jobs, salaries and livelihoods, and Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the continued reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production."
According to Platis, the director of the factory had received a letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with workers, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain companies on the market, we are constantly evaluating all our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the informant, the company has invested over 5 million pounds in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and in improving its operation.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and we will certainly tell the workers and trade union representatives first if we intend to make changes to the factory's operation."
Did PSG Barcelona warn about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar's pursuit after paying a transfer sum of £ 189 million, but did PSG Barcelona be warned about a record transfer three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most popular case in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transfer sums. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer sum of 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, since PSG offers him over 500,000 pounds a week's salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the activities of PSG and the way Neymar has fled from the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players of the series.
"I am not worried, because they know that if they seek our players, we will become their opponents and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the seuros.
But if they seek our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have committed just this: it expressed interest in the PSG's middle-field player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its star player Neymar.
Liquid brakes on the upturn of the stock exchange - Exchange news - Night-Sanomas

NYT: Trump's inflamed calls were invented - the White House informant: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's misleading calls with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the scouts' organization have proved to be invented.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there were no calls.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of patrols spoke to Trump personally, and with President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had discussed at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard charge.
Those conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders justified.
Speaking to the patrollers aroused resentment
On Monday, Trump reported that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump's successful illegal migration to be destroyed.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few will come across the southern border of Mexico anymore, because they know the trip to the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release stating that the call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That was where Trump glittered his speech at a large meeting of the National Patrol Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the patrol boys, he said it was the finest speech that's ever been made to them.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the scouts' organization reported that it is not aware of the call of any of their managers to Trump.
According to the news, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, the leader of the organization, in which he had asked Trump's apologies to the patrollers, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the patrol organization was astonishing, as it was an exceptional policy in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, glittered the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
