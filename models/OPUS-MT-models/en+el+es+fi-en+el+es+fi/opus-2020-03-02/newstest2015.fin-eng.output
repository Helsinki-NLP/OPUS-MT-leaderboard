Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists.
At this moment, the leadership of Kyoto does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said the news agency according to Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and West claim to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian forces further away from their moments where Putin said the Ukrainian army were shooting civilians.
The goal of militia activists is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they will not be able to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjajamo.
It was a surprise that the crowd came from the very beginning of the night.
Visitors were expected in two days, Promotor Tom Kangas reports.
The Hiphop Festival of the Wall River was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop festivals, so pop's not on promise, Kangas says.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law restricting the acquisition of explosives.
During the continuation, individuals shall apply to the Police Administration for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitrogen acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the concentrations determined are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is found in cleansing and detergents, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, during the acceleration drive.
However, prior to the entry into force of the Act, the procured primary substances may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioliiga: Super Raheem shined - Mario remained in shadow - Valioliiga - Night-Sanomas
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday, when Mario Balotelli's reinforced Liverpool arrived at Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field in quite a different attitude than in Manchester City.
The ballottel was still far from the top.
The Italians lost three high-quality targets and fed only half of their sixteen inputs to their own team.
The Pool supporters who have already taken the player's favourite will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers set up Balotelli to Barcelona, who took Luis Suarez's role as second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star, Raheem Sterling, instead of the Balotel, shook the middle-field diamond tip of a 3-0 win over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine in power.
The Englishman, 20 centimeters shorter than the ballet, is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The property is not common to a player who thanks at his best for about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
Since the match, the Northern Irish told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a single, more comprehensive player from the northeastern London root of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the champion of the Helsinki City Orchestra, "I'm happy and proud."
The Helsinki City Hall has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next major champion of the Helsinki City Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers up to the Los Angeles Times have asked what orchestra he's taking next.

The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for over 100 years, including by portraying a large number of Sibelius music.
Orchestra has led the best Finnish capital masters and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I'm looking forward to our future cooperation," he says.
Administrations of Employee Organisations in Pension Consultation - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen

Thereafter, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The labour market organisations have, among other things, been hampered by the dispute over the commitment of pension age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a working career solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created during this week.

Lidl takoo wild figures in Finland
The company's turnover in Finnish stores increased by almost 25 per cent in the end of February to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company published its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 shops in Finland, and enlargement will continue.
Lidl also reported that it paid taxes to Finland for the last financial year almost EUR 14 million.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in rarely populated areas due to late diagnosis and handicapped treatment access
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video to honor her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed more than 1100 patients with ovarian cancer diagnosed in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after the diagnosis.
The main researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rarely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the research than women living in urban areas.
MINIMUM RESEARCH: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the chance of survival.
In older women and with cancer, the likelihood of survival during the diagnosis was small.
Women living in rarely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during research than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that possible causes of delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"Gynecological oncology specialists best handle this disease, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming widespread and the importance of distance is diminished, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-olds in the Gold Coast family mother Elisa Neave identified malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to reinforce the stationary stationary parking activity in the Friendly Park, located next to the hotel in the Northwest.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for the status formula for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be placed on the public service point Osviittaan.
The draft formula will be asked for opinions from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the change in stationary patterns, the city wants to allow the continuation of tourism-related motorkelling activities in the area.
The site is intended to form a park that keeps within it the existing Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
In the period from 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 motorkels shall be available on site.
The area may also be equipped with tank points for a specified portion.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Friendship Park for motorkelling companies during the winter.
The rental agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid for spring 2018.
Even a loud voice of opposition has been raised by a keel parking activity and change of patterns.
The residents of the neighboring floor houses have been in anger as much as they are concerned about emissions.
However, the emissions of the region have been examined and no findings have been identified above the guide values.
The upgraded equipment is even lower than the old ones.
The friendly park as a parking area also supports the fact that if the destination was to be moved further away, the hotel's safarians should be transported to the safari departing places on buses that would be estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and the surrounding environment are also sufficiently large, better than replacing places of departure, such as the east side of the river Ounas.
The Friendship Park is good for its location because activities can be expanded in the future, for example in the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the aim of the city is, inter alia, to create a good framework for business activities by providing adequately high-quality areas for logistical and operationally affordable sites.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point of motorkelling for the centre's sub-general, which has not yet received legal power.
The landing of property dwellings is seen in garden hamlets
The decrease in the number of dwellers, especially in the group of under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of gardening plants by tens of millions when young consumers today reach their age on behalf of the "principal target group" of gardening. Financial Times reported on the research of the UK Garden Trades Association (Horticultural Trades Association, HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, only 55% of the amount of money spent by dwellers in the gardens are used by tenants.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings without gardens. Furthermore, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking space, and these factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be about £5 billion a year.
In the Greater London region, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and there the least money is used for garden products per household in the whole country.
According to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), however, the increase in renting housing or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS's leading garden advisers Guy Barter says that "e.g. plants to be raised in breeding containers are particularly popular among the tenants, as such breeding containers can be included as necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of blooming in the garden sector as the ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will grow this year due to better weather conditions, which are worse than last year's March and April weather.
Turkey is questioning the US diplomat on account of the spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to present a report on the espionage carried out by the Americans and British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden by the US National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy of the United States and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news offices, President Tayyip Erdoga of Turkey has reduced the importance of the report, saying that all major states have spyed on each other.
The previous report on the espionage of the German primary intelligence service in Ankara led to a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze shows up in the new Finnish film
In several successful films, the Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze has been attached to the female capital in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in the film of Mikko Kuparise at 2:00 a.m., which will start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Women's Capital Award for his role in the Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has been featured in, among others, Steven Spielberg's film in Munich and Julian Schnabel's film in Perhone's glassboard.
Two nights in the morning movie, Mikko Nousiainen, is the main man in the movie.
The film will take Finland's first night in September 2015.
Major Majorca Magaluf Police Chief accused of corruption
Evidence was provided by the public prosecutors in the Office of the Attorney-General of Mallorca on Friday by the police and officials of the city government in Calvia.
The chief of the Calvian police station on the Majorca Holiday Island has been arrested as a result of the charges of corruption filed by the Magaluf movement and bartenders in the area of the wet celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several Punta Ballena street owners filed charges of corruption against him. Most of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located on Punta Ballena street.
According to Mallorca Journal, the newspaper published online, the complainants presented evidence of the extortion by police officers and officials of the City of Calvia in the Office of the Prosecutor against Corruption in Majorca on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police in connection with charges of corruption, and they are being interrogated by the judge in conjunction with Navarre.
ABC, a newspaper in the whole country, wrote about the impartiality of the hostile authorities of the club owners, which significantly hampered their business.
"The question is no longer about money, but about survival," one of the business owners said to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines of newspapers this summer, when on-line YouTube video, where an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men, called pub crawling.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the numbers of participants of the insolent, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the night club and the pub crawl organizer Carnage were ordered to jointly pay a fine of EUR 55 000.
Above all, among the young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol use when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the area of the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday's summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and grenade throwers bombed their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombings in southern Israeli communities, but the tracks of battles are still visible.
In the south of Ashdod, Pashosh Day House, the workers removed traces of chips from the walls and slipped before the children arrived after the rocket hit the Day House.
"We're a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area are in an arduous need of routines.
The 11-year-old daughter of Bart, Shani Bart, thinks it's going back to school in a long time, it feels "a little weird."
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbuts near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of inhabitants of communities in the border area of Saad had stayed in indoors or left their homes in safer areas from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the community near the Gaza Strip, Nahal Oz, are suspected of return after the killing of a four-year-old Palestinian son in the Community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, near the Gaza border town, which was subjected to a heavy Palestinian crisis.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the current ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to remove the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in the war from the weapons of Hamas.
Egypt is expected to start the new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they have not had any supportive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
In battles, Hamas and other Gazarian soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people escaped under protection from over 100 UN schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
Tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and school authorities moved the beginning of the last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old school in the city of Gaza.
According to the generally used measure, housing prices have risen most to seven years in Australia's winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Price Index for Australian Capital Housing Prices increased by 1.1 per cent in August, as shown by the RP's data on Monday.
As a result of the rise in the prices for summer, July and August, prices increased by a total of 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily around the country.
According to RP Data's research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 11,7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin's housing markets are now the hottest; the average price increase is from 5 to 6 %.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of apartments sold over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Bearing in mind the increase in sales of auctioned dwellings, the overall high rate of sales and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the rise in prices of housing will continue in the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to the Mäntä
This summer, the new museum and photography have drawn record audiences from Mäntä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been, among other things, pop art classical works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, Mäntä's photographic week told me that he had made a visitor record when 14 500 interest had been visited this summer at the One-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A
These figures have not been used to.
People have stopped from doors and windows," says the director Pauli Sivonen Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that all year round, the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums will come this year to bring hundreds of thousands closer.
In previous years there have been some 40,000 visitors.
In the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11 000 inhabitants in Mänttä-Vilpula.
The museum director, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always opening up phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the period of art will continue over the long summer.
In the autumn, the art museum will open new exhibitions.
The police are investigating the last four days of thieves in Kajaan.
Sunday night, on the North Street, they broke into a business property by breaking a window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Deep Street was stolen from a truck tank of fuel.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its rear engines had been taken from the port of deceit.
The enclosure boat was marked by Kalapalta with a bright exterior and yellowing inside.
On the inside, the text "OIVA".
A couple of suspects stolen from the police already got caught.
Sunday night at Tikkapuronti, they broke into the commercial property.
The policeman got a trace and a 20 - year - old Palestinian was found in the woods from hiding under a moon.
On Monday, the police captured another man from Paltamos, who is also suspected to have committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of an amphetamine lot of less than ten grams brought a murder charge to a Kayan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, a man had gone to the apartment with his single wife and another man and shot a gun at the drug exporter of a 34-year-old Kajani woman who was suspected of being an owner of the apartment.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that another man was a shooter.
The case came to the police's attention when the police stopped a passenger car with a crew burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, there was a cut-off shotgun in the car.
The court of appeal shall issue a judgment later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Institute, the same warm August repeats on average once in ten years.
The statistics of the Institute show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
Most of the country's deviation was from one to two degrees.
Because of July and August's hells, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Port, where the measure showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a migrant family from the seven-year-old Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing Rudy's Rare Records for a comedian show, which is partly based on his father's visual discussion and developed on the basis of a radio 4 channel series.
The sound track is a mix of reggae and rap at the upbeat pace.
Henry has been forced to go through painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His face never showed up, just a voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer chair or the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
Most of my life he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal insulate in Dudley and was thus given the impression of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are now better than at that time.
The meltdowns are now slightly lighter, but they are practically dark, smoked, labyrinthic depths, with flames, smokes and rusts flowing, and reminding me of that.
Father used to go to a bath and only to land in a bathtub, and quietly he began to sing himself by squeezing the dirt of the melting house out of himself.
As I walked around the meltdown, I realized that he had done that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite that, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness offered by parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
Until my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter, Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love that she cared for as a child.
Do you have to say, "I love you all the time"?
Stop that hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, with whom he's been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one reason that led to mother's death.
When I started to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I started a lot of exercises, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during the construction.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics on his role as Othellona, he has sunk into making a theater.
The next turn was the comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making a theater offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done all his busy career.
Henry started in the field when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A dishwasher spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-1970s. "How long I was the only black fan and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I had to grow up in the lights of publicity, I had to learn to produce jokes from slip belts between 1975 and 1985, while I lived staring and I was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to the The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black machining, so Henry ended up a comic book for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgraceful, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to treat the public.
Yet "the award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program of British TV" was at the same time "a fierce parody of black people".
Henry worked in the '80s in a second series of comedys in which both the black British culture was ruined and admired.
The first episode of the Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
That's what Henry spent the next decade on ads, documents, TV series and movies, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.tv show at BBC, he said to himself, "What you're going to do next, Len – now it seems like you're just on your way or on sideways."
The next turn was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us at school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wore stockings and had money.
That's why Shakespeare raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
See words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your word, do a little background research.
So the practice process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The show was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part in the comedy of Errors.
All of a sudden, I was at the British National Theater, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once the play had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to make it 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me came out of relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it for the rest of us.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
The Henry "Fences" show at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn about the "Fences" show.
Panic is a good thing, it makes man more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was as a sign of the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is, of course, what Henry says with a loud voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comicist: small humour boys are constantly interrupting our conversations when he switches from imitation to imitation.
Retention of Stand-up comics is a question of will, because receiving immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theater when it feels like it, but in general it doesn't enthusiastic me anymore as it used to be.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on a new stand-up tour again.
It gives me real joy to sit with the director who helps to shape the whole journey at the beginning, the middle and the end, and I don't think I ever want to give up on that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like to act...
It's really fun.
The show keeps telling the story, and I enjoy it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenia draws up a register of officials to eliminate the "family workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in attempting to remove the "family workers" from government paylists.
Employees who did not enter the register during the next two weeks would no longer be entitled to wages were reported in the government notice.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid wages after they have left office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to crack public sector corruption after entering office in 2013.
Previously, this year's inspection showed that wages and other financial abuses by "fiction workers" cost at least one million dollars a month.
The Government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his or her official mission, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials shall report to the register during the following weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric form of registration, as reported in the government's notice.
According to the bulletin, all those who fail to do so without proper reason will be removed from wage lists.
"This measure significantly rationalizes the public sector, as it defines how many people actually work on their tasks, as well as clearing wage lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of "development workers", says Anne Waiguru, civil servant of the Ministry responsible for decentralization and planning.
The results of the 2015 financial year of the Seinä River may remain at EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adapts to its activities and expenditure development in a difficult economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual period is falling to about 9.4 million deficits.
The potential means of enhancement included the scope and level of services, the purchase of services, the sale of property and subsidies, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
Of the EUR 10 million in investment, 8.5 million is totalled.
The situation of municipalities is not allowed to be relieved.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in government shares further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the strategy objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Government returned the presentations made for preparation by the Management Group.
The proposals of the City Government are the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Council's Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the Council Seminar, the proposal for a budget will proceed through the committee process to the municipal government and to the municipal council.
Ten Turkish police officers were arrested as suspects against the "juon" government.
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "the anti-government plot", reports local media sources.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers among those arrested.
Some of the police were involved in last December's corruption investigations of government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested on charges in Turkey for organising a large crime unit and following telephones.
President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that period) said that police activities were part of the planned activities against him and others in power by the Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer breaks.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took her daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the vast Ukrainian border, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, who is the leading teacher in Slavic school where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day include traditionally children's written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry in Texas, the whispering tweet was unauthorized.
On Sunday night, a striking picture of the democrats' constituency was sent from the established Twitter account of Rick Perry, who heard allegations of abuse of power.
Tweetti was removed later, and followed by a new tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent out of my account unauthorized.
"I do not accept tweet and I have removed it," said the later publication.
Perry's background forces did not respond immediately to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the image.
The first tweet included a slanderous pile of Travis and Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a racing drink in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg's office from being financed when it refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was charged. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times permissible on larger proms... But when it does, I blame Governor Perry for showing his finger."
I'm the most drunkest democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonia, who was assigned by the Republican importer.
Perry has said he's innocent and called charges a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge to dismiss the charges and said that the law under which the governor of Texas who is the most long-standing is being charged is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut State aid of $7.5 million to a state non-injurious entity operating in the district of Travis and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision was formally appealed by the left-wing Monitoring Group.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After entering fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to end the game by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself sneaking on the lake with the text "Here comes, South Carolina!" with the text.
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's main builders has warned that the South-East-England housing market has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London has troubled enormous demand and sharp price rise while fearing widespread credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to set restrictions on housing loans in June.
On Monday, the founder and president of the high-level construction company, Tony Pidgley, said that since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal after the 2013 spike, adding that this has enabled a "stable operating environment".
During the decline in London's housing market, foreign investors sought the capital by flock.
According to the Land Register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley increased by around fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423 000 by the end of April.
However, the reinforced pound has made London's property less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric of possible "kartanover" before the May general elections.
Last week, London's real estate intermediary Foxtons warned that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth, both in terms of sales volumes and prices, in the second half of the year.
On Monday, recent data from the Bank of England showed that the number of approved loans fell in July, referring to cooling housing markets.
The real estate broker Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast on the prices of London's real estate. According to this, prices fall by 3%, as the price index of the dwellers' opinions on the prices has already begun to deteriorate.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen to four years ago, reports the real estate broker WA Ellis.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing to Berkeley, who raised revenue from the property sold to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that ‘the demand for a well-planned, correct product at best locations has remained stable and therefore the sales have remained steep'.
In June, the company reported that it sold 3 742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than the peak of the previous economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent to 380 million pounds a year ago and turnover increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley told us on Monday before the company's annual meeting that the earnings of Berkeley's year correspond to the current expectations of the market.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is £450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock market sold steadily 23.96 pounds in London.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the net.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards Awards.
A hacker who claims to have a hundred other stars' pictures leaked Oscar's actress Jennifer Lawrence's delicacies on the net.
The star of famine confirmed that the pictures are genuine and condemned the hacker for "abusive violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will get the charges.
The images that were originally published on the 4chan photo publication page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to Apple's weakness in the iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other hacking stars claimed to have dozens of other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed, told.
We do not know how much of the pictures are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim against World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at me and my husband's home in privacy, pictures taken years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, the Victoria Justice series of "iCarly" and "Victorious" of Nickolodeon denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "the so-called naked pictures of me are WORKED, don't you understand".
Let me make this end immediately at the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late on Sunday that the representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only we show up for Howard Jacobson's new novel of love and j-kirja.
They slipped, it was the best picture of what happened, gradually they split apart like a carton left out in the rain.
Only then did he hear from a woman that she was too serious, hard-to-be, intensive, untied, and perhaps a little bit squirrel.
That's when he rolled his hand.
He recognized the stingy.
Yeah, he was squirrel, like a brick.
The last victim of his spikes had been an early relationship, but it had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought to his life even some content.
Ailinn Solomons had unbearable hair, and he was a delicate beauty with a joyful heart, from the village of the north, which was even cramped and farther away than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with his older traveling partner, who Kevern assumed was his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house that was located in a moist but paradise valley, and the valley's name was appropriately Paradise valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the stains had left their marks in the windows keeping the whole place their own, and in the garden there were rich grasses that resembled giant cranes.
The cottage was like a child's harvest, threatening and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
As told by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" will be nominated to receive the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailin on a broken terrace in the middle of a long hill, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to the dispersed reception through which the whole earth heard calming music and calming news when Ailin's crosses, the sun browned feet brought into the mind of Kevern's song, which had long since been sung by a black performer and which his father had often listened to at the bottom of the cottage.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive, and were no longer played at the receiver.
They had not been banned — nothing was actually banned — but were no longer called.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word itself.
The general opinion led to what was not achieved by the laws and the proclamation: just as in literature, people chose to read heroes' memories, cookbooks and romance, in terms of music, they favour ballads.
As the day was wild, Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing a serenade to the big feet of Ailin with a fierce coma.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the Jazzpianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was how his father had always done before the "j" letter had gotten away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let your mouth start with J, and you didn't remember lifting two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't it now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard that.
Even Jazzi was not actually declared banned, it was simply not called.
Improvement was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word if.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, the jazz music had become known to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailini, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the recommended singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or forcing here either.
The hearing society meant that each of its parts accepted the principle that each group did natural things to it, as if they were saved by a lucky trade.
Based on its temperament and physical characteristics, the Afro-Caribbean tribes possess people best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that each family had an operating phone used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the platform.
When WHERE THE WORLD WHEREW WHERE WHEREW WHEREW WHERE, they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled in the fear that they would be charged with burning flames and fearing that the flames would come after them, they opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning water pipes, and continued to look at the earth as created and depressed.
Let everyone do their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern just sang could never be dressed as music.
The music showed love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-fashioned.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was amusing," he said instead.
Ailinn fell in his head unfaithful, and his hair covered Kevern's field of sight.
There's nothing else to see in the whole world but Ailin's huge, sloppy haircut.
There's nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say that," he said, "but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm that could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his mild eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose up from his terrace, while pouring down the receiver and sprinkling the wine they had just drunk.
And the wine was made of only breeze flowers, so he couldn't use it as a cause of a crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking, like the palm leaves in the storm.
"And your thick head is that which I am pervertedly attracted to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that appeared in the eyes of this at the time Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in this northern island where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, good sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, though, after EVENING, even more pale and devilier than their smugglers and dispersers, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or cuddle them.
A thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First, kissing had become the most common word of erotic encounter between men and women; the antidote of unimportant ballads that were pumping out the receiver — suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, because it was hostile to be absorbed in itself.
Ailinn's body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's sorrow surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go upstairs from the window — a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Aatami leaving the garden, he wondered.
He had an hour of pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
Turning his back, bowing, shameful, beaten man who had lost all the battle goal — why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen it once before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the general opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study on the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in those areas of the country where the decline, or the end of violence, was likely to take into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that can be levelled with the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote coils, where, despite the transcendent church towers, human mildness is rarely known in times.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it has created.
The nation weeps with sentimental ballads, amidst stories about the victorious conflicts and swears in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the cruelty of the old-fashioned people keeps both rural communities and urban areas in common, and there is evidence of a new, more indulgent conflict in homes, jobs, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put his eyes down.
Besides, I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme still appealed to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of unprejudiced society.
Although some kind of hypersensitivity is in itself completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, as you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil spirit — others usually call natural energies and physical strength.
Doing WHAT WAS DEAD, WHEN I WAS DEAD, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened, will destroy the earth's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamenco light LED declared the direction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the word sung is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum responded with a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will see that we repeat the same mistakes that originally led to SIIH, WHEN WAS WAS WAS WAS killed.
This time, though, we will not leak our hatred and our untrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when depicting the 'fails' of the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they poured out 'their hatred and their untrust to others'."
A person like you should not have to remember that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'them'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group in society can say that he behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, was done, was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk more about this – we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to make them.
But for what, then, is the past, if it is not taken as a lesson...
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and stated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he was working, he was hit by a motorbike driving on the foot corridor, whose driving was described by the passengers as "bad and angry".
Successes occur.
The army of Lesotho refuses to plan a strike; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The officials of the army of Lesotho have denied that they have framed the attack for the invasion of the government and have said that they are acting against the police who were suspected of attempting to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and powered government buildings in the capital of Maserou.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighbouring country of South Africa after telling him that he had a death threat.
The military representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the strike and said that the military responded to this threat that came from "political fanatics". The police have been said to try to gun the fanatics.
"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence information that some police officers are trying to gun young party fans while they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to President Clayson Monyela of the South African Government, military operations seemed to be a revolutionary enterprise.
"Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the defence forces of Lesotho appear to be symbolic to all sides of the revolution," he says.
According to officials of the army of Lesotho, soldiers return to their armies on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government while Thabane is gone.
Thabane says he believes that he is the subject of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Since June, there have been tensions in Lesotho, when Thabane interrupted the meetings of the delegation because of the disagreements of the Government of the Great Coalition.
He thus refuses to deny the authority of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Newspaper: Microsoft is setting up a data centre for Newland
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre for Newland, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
In the communication sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not report the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajania had previously been implied as a centre.
Microsoft completely stops its Oulu headquarters, which takes the job from about 500 people.
On the whole, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff a new data centre employs.
On Monday, the Newland was told about the establishment of the Data Centre.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have a variety of different device options to choose from.
The most advanced option is waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which paid less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be followed.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are sealed waterproofly.
In addition, set camera description settings to match the images or video taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a regulation that optimizes the description conditions underwater.
Also — before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50 to 60 feet deep.
Get to know both our usual and waterproof models in our shopping guide and reviews of digital cameras.
Take a number of pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to tap the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forcing, which means taking several images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when photographing the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This is how you get more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice when describing on the ground, but even more important underwater, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when used when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image angle, that is, the imager must be close to the target to fill the entire image frames up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – demonstrators vow to vengeance
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that the voters of Hong Kong should not choose candidates for elections in 2017, despite the increasing need for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business world when activists start planning and implementing mental expressions only for hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the People's Congress of China actually gives the Communists the power to remove all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still angering," says President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This isn't what Peking promised.
They've lied to the Hongkongilians.
It is clear that we are dealing with self-government.
Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General for the Committee on the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the appointment of a general candidate in the election of the leader of Hong Kong would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised to the inhabitants of the region that it would elect its leader from 2017 onwards.
According to China's leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough because it enabled Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also made it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
The summer before the decision was held in Hong Kong for some of the largest and most attention-sensitive protests in the region for years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which the organizers have threatened to prevent business block operations, was largely behind the campaign if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine public right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement met in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and would produce protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not tell the details apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In the online release, the organisers said that the movement "to hold Occupy Central as the last means that will only be introduced if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been hampered and that the power of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, peacelessness is fueled by the feeling of many that the inhabitants are quietly losing power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has led to competition for products and services.
In addition, there is fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its expressions threaten Hong Kong's vital condition — the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the business.
We do not want you to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state's media has also presented stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the thieves of the Western powers that are stimulating the revolution."
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people — more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the major demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
The U.S. prom tradition hits British universities: for new students private jets
We are excited to respond to demand by setting up the first class of British luxury travel for today's students.
In addition to a private airplane, the company also offers other transport vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 so that the customer can ensure as long as possible a memorable entrance to the University.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy as possible and high-quality transportation to the University.
According to the company's representative, no reservations have yet been made because the service has only been established, but he added that "the students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 GBP annual fees.
Today's students are very different to their expectations and hopes from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, a national student organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the University College, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority".
Many of their studies start this month are shocked at the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the sharp rise in basic organ costs, and only afterward can we begin to wonder where thousands would be used for as simple as a matter of arrival in the campus.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the body of victory in Finland.
He was able to forget his symposium with his US match and rebounded the second half of Ukrainian blood with its standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the honor to the wolfs and did it in the style:
I was going to faint down there at the end of the field, that incentive was so great.
In the eyes, in my mussel, there was nothing.
That noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
The moments of Salin's power kept in it nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball rifts, discs and templing everywhere that happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode that everything worked out.
They only come in some time, now in an unintelligible important place, Sasu shining.
That's my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that others got caught up in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joyful pill and spirit creatures, so it's no wonder that his example put the entire team on a flight that was too much for the big and tough five Ukrainians.
In the MM contests in Finland, after 32 years of break: The previous ones were left with a fierce game of judges
Heikki Montonen (Oik.) was Finland's main coach at the 1982 World Championship in Argentina.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish football team played the last time in the MM final tournament.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Kingdom Kosonen was Finnish second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot fight against France in the first section.
"In the balls of the match, the judge's game was filthy," Kosone recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game went on.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played at the command of Chief Coach Heikki Montose and finally ranked at 17th.
Now Finland is among the world's choices once again, when the Polish World Championship will be speeding up on Saturday.
Many things have changed sharply in the international balloon over 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same class as before, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average players' lengths have also grown.
The game is faster," Parkkali said.
But what happens in Poland?
Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I'm waiting for Finland to move on from the beginning.
Then you can get tight," Kosone assesses.
Seppo Sirk
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victorious fight against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to petrate the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to the corner," Parkkali said.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was a second coach for the country team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkko fanned at the Tunis game.
Sauna and evening exercise in Buenos Aires were part of the country team's programme in the MM tournament 1982.

The moment of competition always leaves great memories, Immonen says.
Finnish tourists saved Cita from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks."
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were troubled on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered courageously to help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
In a public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told me that the Cita dog in the mountains on Thursday hurt his stomach.
The wounded dog couldn't walk in a steep terrain anymore.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried to attract it and pull it a little further many times, but its feet didn't just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no need for help from the police, the nearby hotel or the passengers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation has already begun to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two walkers who were ready to help: the tamperian Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
Men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain breast.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively peaceful in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini will tell him in the message he sent to Night-Sannis.
Soon there was also a German man who had an expedition box with him.
From the mattress to Cita, they got the likes of the bars on which the injured dog was caught.
The German man showed up for a moment after us, when we had wondered what to do with the dog and carry the dog in his arms for a while, Soini says.

The dog was taken down by means of an expedition mattress.
Soin said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on a difficult terrain was slow.
However, about an hour and a half later, Cita was happily brought down.
After the event, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that I could thank them once again.
Soins answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unattainable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have necessarily returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soins were already on their way home.
They'd been happy to hear from Mikkelins: "I hear Cita's feeling better already!

Genetic abnormality is often diagnosed wrong
The British woman was afraid of dying for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years of life left because he had diagnosed another disease.
He really suffered from Charcot-Marie-Toothi's disease (CMT). It means a bunch of inherited diseases that damage the brain and spinal cord's external nerves.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because they are so little known.
According to the estimates, some 23 000 people in Britain are suffering from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes' pain.
Disease can also cause insanity or pain, and it is unhealthy and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was sick of Friedreich's atax (FA), with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and died before he reached the age of 30.
Nowadays, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, "When I was a kid, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the rest of them.
I fell down every day and it took me more than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was performed with several aquilles tendon cuts to straighten his feet. After the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked out the medical information in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I found out about them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and in the meantime I'd lose all my ability.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT disease is, I thought I was postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK arranges the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of immigrants were found in a coal car in Macedonia.
More than a hundred illegal immigrants have been found by Macedonian authorities on a coal train, the Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
Lightning travelers were mostly Syrians and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Movers were found late on Sunday in Veles in Central Macedonia.

They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, Minister of Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about €3,000 each to reach Greece, and another €800-900 to reach Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel a lot through a couple of million Macedonians on their way to Western Europe.

The municipal government showed a fair sense of sport and was unanimous in its decision.

Hull washed the attacker with the record sum of Hernandez's company
The Valioliga Society Hull placed a record of the company in the acquisition of the Uruguayan country team Abel Hernandez.
Hernández exchanges the Italian association with Hulli for Palermos for 9.5 million pounds, or about 12 million euros.
It's a three-year deal.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last year when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the Italian main series.
In the Uruguayan country team, he has made seven goals in 14 matches.
Last summer's MM final tournament, Hernandez came in two matches from the exchange to the field.
Abel is a fantastic purchase and shows how far we have reached in a short time," said Hull's main coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also reported that he acquired a Senegalese country team accomplice from Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
The Russian space test failed. The geese sent on a sex trip died.
The five small gekkos sent to Russia to increase space have been killed, reports the Russian Federation Space Organisation when reporting to Roscosmos.
The Gekot traveled on the photon-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning time in Finland.
The purpose of the test was to study the reproductive capacity and use of gekkos in a non-pressure state.
One male genus and four females participated in the test.
Although the test sounds unusual, it was meant to be serious.
For example, little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geek eggs.
Through the effects on gekkos, we can seek to predict the impact that the lack of weight would have on humans in a situation similar to that of longer times in July, observed by New Statesman.
Roscosmos says the time of death of geeks and the cause or causes of death will be investigated.
According to Interfax's news agency, cross passengers were "sexy" frozen.
Surprisingly, it also tells us that the fruit flies that travelled on the same photon-M4 rides survived uncomfortablely and also received post-growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice airport.
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man was suspected of acting as recruiter of the Yyhadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track a man after this had attracted a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border there.
The airline didn't believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but she alarmed the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely ignorant of the daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radically attracted young people in Iraq or Syria are also a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or books in France have traveled to Syria, returned or are currently planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have good chances of winning
The hopes for the basketball team for the posterity are at stake when Finland meets today in its second match of the World Championships in Ukraine.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine would belong again to those countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have a good chance of winning, Petter Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine hit the races in its first match in the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team trains the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is commanded by Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but yes, we've been played against those before and we have to get our standard defense fixed, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that we'll see a normal wolf floating on the field, "Möttölä said.
Hollywood Stars' alleged desks are spreading on the Internet... part of it's sure to be real.
There are a number of naked images on the Internet that are alleged to present well-known publicities.
Among other things, an actor, Jennifer Lawrence, has become a victim of the "naco-picture campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which would seem to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) pictures stolen by Jennifer Lawrence will be charged, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos that spread him are genuine.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what creepy trouble was seen for this.
I feel sympathy for everyone who was hacked, he writes according to the website.
Instead, the actress Victoria Justice calls the pictures that go in her own name forged.
Real or fake naked pictures are also on the move at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunsti, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka's goalkeeper criticized his own, "They don't work enough to get out of here."
Soccer club FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Veicus League.
The commentary by Walter Viitala after Sunday's VPS game describes the confusing current situation of the company.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," Viitala said after the 1-2 loss ended after the fight.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes, especially in the first half of the time.
The goalkeeper, Viitala, wasn't happy to play a bad defense game.
Gaming in Hong Kong this summer has been a vibrant one, and for that reason the defenders in front of Vitala have also changed to a sharp pace.
With the playground, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"The part does not work enough to get out of here," Viitala whipped without no individual player.
Hong Kong's main coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"I told you after the game to certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a gambler, you don't have to work, so you're probably wrong on the team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players cannot expect immediate success when the gamemates are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the defense heads, people have changed.
That is the biggest reason why we are in this place," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, even with the second TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so the Spaniards still have time to avoid falling into One.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not going to fall right now.
We will certainly not fall from this series," painter Viitala threatened.

Turnover went from EUR 960 million to EUR 1.2 billion.
The growth was 25%.
The company that raised its market shares also improved its operating income from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The percentage of turnover was 7.1.
The accounting period of the German own Lidl will last from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company reports that it paid taxes to Finland EUR 13.7 million for the financial year ended in February.
The company that extended its sales chain has continuously reported its investment in Finland this year in EUR 100 million.
Finland currently has 142 Lidl sales and employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket's challenge from the participant's position of the chin
Britt Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when cold water was poured on him that he damaged his face's bones.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended very badly.
The woman has been taken care of since she cried out for an Ice Bucket challenge so fast that her jaw was placed.
Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when ice water was poured on him that he damaged the structure of his face.
"The water was so cold that I was just screaming, but when I was screaming, I felt that my jaw started to stiffen," he tells The Mirror magazine.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a moment before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to rush the first aid.
The 20-year-old British involved in the super-recommended challenge was taken to the hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video scene has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of vision in the wolf's outskirts (also): How can the growth of fans explain?
Today was a great day.
This was what the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played an EM tournament against France in the Athens Marouss ballroom.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I remember the game when I was there.
So were about a hundred Finns who cried out 20,000 spectators to draw, otherwise to the empty hall noises.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian match of the World Championships?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times a hundred Finnish fans.
The EM contests in 1995 were a time of search for Finnish basketball.
Men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian carnival game in the Helsinki sports house.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Chief coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä's limeline to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed.
Now you can say that Dettmann was very wise, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens's races, the Finns were known to be present in a total of a little over a hundred.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao too, but there are also fans there.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into incomprehensible measurement ratios.
I'm sure no one can say exactly a number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
Whatever number between that time, it's an incomprehensible amount.
Here's to explain to sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies move across borders.
There is still a chance in sport to look at how we go internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and our sons succeed in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
I'm sure there are Finnish people in both Spain and the World Cup of the Balloon in Poland who are applying for a living.
A shared experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Even at sports, there's got to be a lot of attraction.
Weeping raises the population culture of sport.
There's a lower threshold to go to sports games than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, however, masses cannot be moved.
Let's get back to 1995.
At that time, Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
Almost ten years went by.
Then the direction changed and the ground team was lifted to the foot.
Airball people did the same move a little earlier.
Now they're both enjoying the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports where sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the public will also be interested.
And the media has taught what this karnevalist support is, wetconen reminds us.
Can ballistics also transfer this massive interest to home shows?
The basketball and flight ball are played on average for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
Weeping is a good question and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
Another school believes interest is moving.
The other one is the one who doesn't want the sweet skin full.
This group is ready for a life trip to the MM contests, but in their basic thinking, the series of the homeland do not care twice.
There's a challenge for people in the middle of drugs.
To the property of Bottas... almost 1.5 hectares from the lake's coast.
Nastola rewards the formula driver at Valtter Bottas Coastal Household.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment for the land.
The success of Bottas has been monitored in Nastola since the time of this maping.
He's being tried as an ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti and Nastola.
The gift box is located in Koiskala, on the beach of Kärkjärvi.
It has come into Nastola's municipality as part of a bigger real estate store.
The area has seven buildings under demolition, from which the municipality will discard six by the end of this year.
Bottas reached Formula 1 in the Belgian contest of his fourth prize winner this year.
He's in the MM points on fifth.
Bottas is a native Nazi and lived in Villahte.
He lives in England today, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from the forms.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth clubs.
Design smart clothes are coming, but hardly for the poor.
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open Tennis Competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are field balloons, but also an amateur from the tops of university players, Marcus Giron, likes it.
He says that the shirt will help him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven in their nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mop in the shirt and from there still to the smartphone or table computer.
The sensors measure the heart rate, rhythms of breathing, stress, and steps.
Before throwing a shirt into a washing machine, the main unit is removed.
The fashion shop hasn't told you exactly how long to start selling a shirt, nor even hinted at its price, Tech Times says.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothes.
The Californian Athos has brought the smart shirt and the smart strings into sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 per piece and the central unit of thumb size required costs $200.
He also wrote about techno-wear Red Orbit.
A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America is more than $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second study, invented a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system where later yearly students borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books forward at the same time.
"My book of mathematics would normally have paid $180; I paid for its use for the whole semester of $10 and a sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia State.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the Board of Directors of the University, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on booklets and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent books, allowing them to use the book for the whole semester and pay much less than students who buy it.
According to Neebo Inc, more than 250 campus books shops, the rental of student books has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of university libraries in the spring were booklets, reports the president of Neebo, Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus libraries.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Net sales
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay in the campus library store.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but the book of special books in the online shop Chegg.com receives the price of $239.99.
Buy as used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not disturb the other notes and the missed appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used from the Chegg.com network store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year's student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought a book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using Amazon.com's online store for only $0.42.
The new book would have paid $48.
The head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous prints can be used during the course.
At times, the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old print can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for in a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon Bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rental
If you take good care of them, you will remember to return them and you will not need them after taking a course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting the book "Calculus" for the whole semester costs about $20.
Know the rules of the leasing company, such as notes, the use and consumption of the emphasis on the following charges.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting E-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented to pay e-book access to its owners, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store receives the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature are saving the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparison of different vendors is worth whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon begin with Pepperdinen in legal science, recommends that you use the book ISBN number to determine the price, because it allows you to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order the network, make sure the book is safely stored, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from the university library store.

Almost twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, fires have killed almost twice as many people as last year.
According to the Finnish media monitoring (Spek), 55 people have already died in fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the system's fire death statistics, the worst situation was the last in 2009, when 64 people were killed in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in the apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the floorhouses, 21 home and 7 line houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety of the home.
At least the operation of all home fire alarms should be ensured by Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the start-up devices are readily available.
All premises in the home must also have an unhindered route of exit.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people met in Newport city centre at the Nato war march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the City Hall of Cardiff, the so-called rebound meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed events this weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by aircraft from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenagers were raised safely after they were stuck at night in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left for a walk after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
People concerned about young people who hadn't returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent to search for young people, and two were found near the falls of Bridal Veil.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and smashed her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The patrollers were taken by an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
The Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to withdraw.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have rapidly joined Russian tanks in the field.
According to the army's representative, the opponent's gunfire has been so accurate that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
Over the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, the Ukrainian patrol vessel yesterday, representing the South-East Ukraine, sunk in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight marine soldiers have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure where the ship was shot.
The separatists already told me yesterday in the social media that they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that the Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia will respond to potential new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, Lavrov threatened to draw conclusions of our partners' actions.
The severe rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the hard-rooted storms hit South Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flooding may take a long time, even though the rains were predicted to cease by Monday.
The heavy rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and the weather warning was not given in advance of the rains.
Ari Mustala, a climatologist at the Finnish Institute of Air Science, estimated that the saderintama in the region was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "be quiet and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" to the socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not give the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to remain with him," Valls said and deserved applause.
As a comforting gesture, the Prime Minister demanded that the government leave the disputed 35 hours of working week in France, despite the proposal earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, which raised the debate, that the rule should be eased.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to act with the joint government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, gave rise to a divergence by showing different opinions to the meeting of socialists and by criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing France to "relinquish hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, head of the U.S. National Front of the U.S. Right, mocked the socialist's continued divergence and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last a few months.
François Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government since the previous one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal for the disintegration of the delegation and expressed confidence that his party's election won in early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crash in March municipal elections and the extreme right held a list of the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion measurement of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche magazine, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Po-University Political Researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning for Finnish planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Poudan betrayed badly in the recorded portion of the program.
Good morning, Finland published the last Thursday, on Facebook page, a fun video recording on Thursday.
The video shows Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola as well as the meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the morning of the next day's broadcast of the Finnish advertising puffi, but the recording does not go straight.
Alm-Siira is confused with his words when he tries to say the word "budget race", and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their pockets once in a while.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull out a direct broadcast even tomorrow, says Morning in the Finnish Facebook Update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
In 1972, Jorma K. Pouta, 68, was the third in the series of Potters.
The image is the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir.
On Fredrikin Street in Helsinki, a socialist international meeting was held in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and there were huge security measures.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards came along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture four and a half feet away.
The light and the background were in place.
I just realized this time I was successful.
From the point of view of Meir, the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
At that time, the competition was able to handle well-known people or events with images taken.
It is great that other images can also succeed today, as long as there is an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall picture of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Claim: The Aarnio investigation already paid more than EUR 5 million
The lawful operation of the Helsinki police unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30 to 50 years of personal work.
Thus, Jyri Rajamäki Jyväskylä assessed the subject matter of the IT study at the University of Jyväskylä.
The border suggests that the law enforcement of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining information technology systems for investigation and legal proceedings.
According to the border, current technology enables the multi-use of criminal materials.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which data collected to investigate the crime are automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legal supervision.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
General: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Food and chicken foods included in plants"
A picture of a special news release on the wall of the School of Women's Travel was produced in the social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetable foods!
Fish and chicken foods were planted at school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make the vegetable option!
This is what is stated in a 15 - year - old, forgotten wall of the school.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread in the social media has led people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Chief of Food and Cleaning Services, states to Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Every student gets a meal according to his wishes, he tells Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools will only be offered a plant food option with parental permission and a doctor's or nurse's certificate of vegetarian diet.
The danger justifys the solution to the general that young vegetarian experiments may leave food short and the lack of meat or chicken can cause wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to the US$ 3 billion Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise company, negotiates to buy its competitor for US$ 3 billion in Prestige Cruises International Inc. The data are from close contacts.
The Norwegian Cruise company, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would be able to use Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on the potential agreement may be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations are not being held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Middle America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, at $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates mainly from Miami, sails on Oceania and Regent brandim, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The US$ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in developing economies in the coming years, such as the Chinese and Indian middle classes.
Companies compete to become the first option for these new customers in their choice of cruises.
Prestige Cruises registers its first release of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 trade, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in 2000 by its current composition with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) crossing company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in the Norwegian Cruise Company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP's 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined share of the North American crossing capacity of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies is 82%, as shown by the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the invoice.
The Tampere City Government will discuss this today.
Animals are hoping that the city government will have a strong initiative to support.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Director of Animals, University of Tampere, for the period of the dolphins in Finland and around the world, there is a need to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that dolphin-like advanced mammals in dolphins are neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be desirable for Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinaario is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of the Tampere image as a tourist destination, points out Jumitivaara.
According to the danger of judgment, the death of Näsi-delfin confirms the requirements for the declining period of the delphinary activity.
It's sad to go on with the dark history of Särkännieme's dolphinary.
It is time to put the dead at a point, to close the dolphin prison and to begin to find out how the dolphins could be transferred to a boundary sea, to a sort of dolphin shelter, demanded by the Judiciary.
Your eyes did not have time to return to the original habitat of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi had more life than their unspeakable concrete land, Judges hope.
Animal Protection Association Animalia aims to prohibit the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection law under preparation.
The dolphins are also included in this group.
In support of the requirement, the Director of Animalia, Jumivaara, will participate in the demonstration of mind on behalf of the Delphins today on 1 September.
The expression of mind at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the period of dolphin hunting in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2300 dolphins, either for the use of dolphins or for food, are held or brutally killed annually.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new country with Eastern Ukraine
On Sunday, President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" of the different region, the Russian news sources tell us.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory of Eastern Ukraine controlled by separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The request made by Putin to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the beginning of the violence five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists to seize the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorossi independence that will enable it to move towards Russia instead of to the West.
In the State Channel 1 interview, Putin condemned the attempts of the Ukrainian army to regain the territory of East Donetsk and Luhansk, which the separatists seized in March and April, following the accession of Moscow to the Ukrainian Krim penitentiary on 18 March.
The Kreml and the separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of glory preceding the revolutions of the great power of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "illucy" for as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately begin extensive negotiations, not just on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" relates to greater independence, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiev in its attempt to relieve the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There can be no discussion on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine".
The Minutes of the Kremli representative, aimed at correcting Putin's 'false interpretation' comments, stressed that the Russian administration is dealing with the rebellion of Eastern separatists in a different way than in the case of Krimi, when it, in practice, took over an area with an ethnic majority of 2 million people.
Moscow would be much more difficult to join even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russians and because, according to the pre-conflict measurements, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence of which Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums would allow the local governments of Ukraine to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kremlin practically power in the area of a link between Russia and Russia.
In the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, the Russian main fleet is located as well as the ports and historical coastal sites of commercial shipping.
There are also excavations, factories and metal sulates in the area between Russia, Rostov and Krimi, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of regions not in the Ukrainian nuclear area from their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence appears to differ sharply from the view of the separatists of Kremlin and Moscow, perhaps armed and stimulant.
Putinin presented his latest demand to the Kiev Government for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners after last week's rebels made further progress after Russia's tanks and troops invaded East Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk, supported by Russia, is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area to Krimi.
It has led to the reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by massive civilian and military personnel. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a harbour-producing city located between Novoazovsk and a narrow land area leading to the Krimi Peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the European Union's leaders in Brussels, asking for further measures to prevent the coming violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll soon reach a point where there's no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders put forward additional sentences so that they can be put into effect if the Ukrainian crisis is resembled under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armor departments and 1 000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told the journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first Ukrainian 63 soldiers in Ilovask in Russia were exchanged to 10 Russian parachute jumpers, who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.
The Milan opening painter Keisuke Honda made a Japanese artist in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez was punished.
Lazio also received a hard hit at the end of the game, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
At the training debyy of the former attacker in Milan, Inzagh, the San Siro stadium was only half of it.
A total of 39,000 audiences were reported.
Australian publishers and Gabi Grecko in the round of the naked picture scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has reported that he's outraged with the hackers, perhaps stolen from his fiancée and Gabi Grecko, Hollywood's "A" list.
The entertainment world has been stunned since a large number of Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging hacking scan.
Hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked pictures of the star of Hunger Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer of Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actor of Kirsten Dunsti.
The pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsk and Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There's 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, in New York City, reports with his comments on the case in the online magazine "disgraceful" and said that the victims "feel themselves to be disgraceful."
Hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with this previous boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer on the edge of the upper-handed pool.
Palmer's films include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck series, Strahovski and Sucker Punch, Browning, didn't comment on hacked pictures yesterday.
Lawrence's representative told the TMZ that "the question is a bogus violation of privacy".
Actress Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his Twitter: "The publication of mobile stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, just from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as in its homefield and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the World Cup of the Balloon.
Look at the pictures of the fans.
On Monday, Poland's Katowice was white: not a Polish red, but a Finnish blue white.
According to STT, the profit of Finland was followed by nearly 2000 Finns in the Spodek Islands.
I felt like I was playing at home.
So much effect on fans was on our game, Captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already in the game losing lots 0-2, but rose to winning lots 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a marvelous rise six points behind.
Cuba already led a 16-10 round, but then the Finns got a humiliation.
However, a couple of Finnish fans had to be disappointed when a charter machine was unable to land in Katowice because of a heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
The Finnish ballistic fans have conquered Europe at a tough pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, there are over 8,000 Finnish fans in the World Cup of Spanish Basketball.
Just as if every Finnish basket had been a winner of the game, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basket fans after Saturday's game.
