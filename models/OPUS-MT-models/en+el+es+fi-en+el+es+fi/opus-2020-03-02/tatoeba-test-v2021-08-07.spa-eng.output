When we are going to die, we will be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we will be about to leave. The earthly friends - the friends who point to us our position, our wealth or our social qualities, - will leave us when we enter the dark valley.

Although not everything will leave us. There is One who "mains closer than a brother" - One who has loved His own who are in the world, loves them until the end.
