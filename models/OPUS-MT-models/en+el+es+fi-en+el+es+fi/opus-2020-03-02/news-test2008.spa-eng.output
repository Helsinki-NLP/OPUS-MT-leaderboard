European Inflation Slide in Food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is due first and foremost to the sharp increase in the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 per cent of the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced by the Union Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave as likely 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian emitting banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, together with rising raw materials prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to 2%.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "there is a need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the 12-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was triggered in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat quotations increased by 88 per cent and soya quotation reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 per barrel black gold last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will fall from 2.1 per cent today to 2.5 per cent, but by 2009 it will decline to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during the year 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - because of the strongest voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth for the socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit needed to have some parliamentary escene: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure electors there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic in terms of changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population suffers from deterioration and only one tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those consulted, higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government was rather misleading than good at his duties.
13 percent of those consulted trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent do not trust the Chairman of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the experienced discontent against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the disturbances of October last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, at present this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of the respondents to the question about participation responded that it would certainly participate and another 20 percent said that it is likely to participate.
In a comparative way, "a general election to be held this Sunday" would take part safely only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultancy service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the secure participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices.
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent in Budaörs' commercial gold triangle hypermarkets, with the difference that this year VAT has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This anus also increased by an average of 16 percent in Budaörs' commercial gold triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the thousand HUFs.
As in December last year prices had already been "dispersed" in the food supermarkets, no dramatic percentage increase was experienced compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do so even for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish was maintained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey steak, walnut and amapole seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found one kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with redeeming bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased with a 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices listed in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket last year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas prices the increase in VAT was felt.
Just this process was the one that disrupted trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader badly plans the speed of the circulation of a product, it may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi basket reached such ends as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such ends, since the highest price has now been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets the price of first-needed consumer goods grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some foods of first need, recorded an increase in price above 30 per cent in the 12-month interval.
Thus, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases, just a 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose drastic price increases even on multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences collected, most consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large tails ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income is below their plans and not only for food, but also for household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year several thousands of infections produced first by the undue application of antibiotics have been recorded in hospitals.
The conditions of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overloading of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An injured person from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after returning to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection, and since then there has been no major surgical intervention for the presence of bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, there have been 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, medical chief of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, of the rest there is no information.
Nearly two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacilin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria on their nose without causing any disease.
HS-produced infections (e.g. inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once excessively or unduly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and quickly contagious in inappropriate hospital conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia, first to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened organisms, elderly people or people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotics Resistant
"These patients are isolated, nurses take care of them in rubber and mask gloves and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so, infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of training and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes of the elderly, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the diseases that carry the MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come out to the public when MRSA infections are already occurring visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological patterns.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be undertaken to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The taking of microbiological samples is even less common in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
He saves himself with the disinfectants.
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is contaged from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is contaged by drop transmission and direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated for at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - said Karolina Böröcz - that in less favourable economic hospitals it is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate preventive measures are implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the pathogen agent's contagion may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of contagion with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Disease Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is combated.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to have successes, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative of control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of district XXII has been made.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that the since-resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passenger, reported on Friday, Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Attorney General's Office, after preparing the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station in the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle, when he folded to the 21st district Kossuth Lajos Street, hit a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(The latter fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Code of Transit are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way by bending.)
Passenger lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police communiqué, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI) Marta Gajecka signed in Budapest on Friday three limited credit agreements totalling EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures as well as the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund subsidy, of which the parties had already signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, which the budget will mainly use for the Debrecen University's innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalized with the EU the details of the Metro funding, they will revert to the issue that whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this can take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charge for maintaining the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, which will quickly grow?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is no doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slope apartments and beach villas.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favourite, while on the Albena beaches, the Golden Coast, the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, Sofia capital can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, careful investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, they also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them is important the proximity of a large city, shops and usually of a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of villas (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital estates is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent.
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening of negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
At present, there are lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not yet wish to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, greenhouse gas emissions will decline by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is that whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need of it.
A further agreement was reached on aid for developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is prepared to commit itself to decreasing even by 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also ready to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed themselves to decline by 5.2 per cent, in this context the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to comply with a 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - notes the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
Much is at stake in Bali, since two years will have to sign the international agreement on long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2o C of the Earth's average temperature, which, according to scientists, would have countless and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on their actions against the Taliban - BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general operating body of Kandahar, then sent to London to be charged to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers who have been loaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - BBC was told by the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the relentlessly edited and censored recordings, the distributor also shows amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "officiary" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak as much of loss, without yet presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos recorded in real operations have been loaded on the Internet from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only taking this opportunity lately.
Americans use a slightly different way to recruit with video games, free of charge, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put directly instead of the soldiers.
Salt tomb and cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts on the Christmas of the Orphans and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently performing missions abroad will be invited. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the end-of-the-year holiday environment.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected to be around three hundred fifty.
At the party of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also act and there will be tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Theatre of the Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we did not manage to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucía's day on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [hear] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to dress suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-the-year working meeting.
There is the participation of a hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will take only coffee and salt cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply provide with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own conference room with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon time of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on 20 January, and Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, which will be invited only to the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions that are celebrated every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [hear].
In the press department of the environment portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Committees will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last for an indefinite time.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the unemployment will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Committees.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machinery Union will also be set up to coordinate the actions of Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating trade unions will pronounce themselves on strike for indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the Public Health Act, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw their appeal to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on at very late hours of the night, or perhaps at midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways we will stop working for an indefinite time, in the morning we may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volan companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement on even the minimum services, although, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike by the LIGA Trade Unions of Electrical and thermal energy industry, the Educational Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will take a national strike at alternative hours and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and put a new conception into a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions, that occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Rail Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the side lines of the railway and expect another proposal different.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard's risk is increased in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Better Hungary Movement, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from a number of points of view.
The company's "risk warning" writes: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes can occur."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate on the Gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "were significantly deteriorating the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the country's stability and democratic development".
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicized and promoted and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been formed in the country that are self-defenced by "national self-defence associations".
"The common trait of these groups is that they self-defense themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defence, defence of public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State," they add.
They affirmed: all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring States they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalistic political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, thus increasing political risks throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to form the guard, with the argument that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
In his view, in the past 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - the Political Capital recalls.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Bulgarian gypsy organizations have announced that in order to resist they will be their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász to the news agency's question stated: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party isn't always written with red numbers.
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America are parties united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious and historical ephemeral holidays.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on May 1st, the work party, on November 1st and November 2nd, we remembered our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts of the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for long weekends like this, on previous Saturdays you cannot leave work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when you have to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory on the other hand for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country is virtually stopped, since according to experiences, most people "does bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the work party so that workers can rest later for four successive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return on Friday 2 May it will be a holiday day.
The other change relates to the party of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year to come during the end of the year will be able to rest, since from December 24 it will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to bite your colleagues' lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: all of them are part of our daily Folclore" at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know you've been searched at the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
In the best of the cases, he feels sorry and tries to repair the matter, perhaps he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least usual solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bite your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, an office tool or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning he disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they're right to be mad at you for taking away their things.
Don't pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and are exhausted before time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private life?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and who?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his closest secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don't gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiedly?
When you call the office on the phone and you say you're sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others must do your job, your unbearable tasks, your work on end.
Don't screw your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something can happen to you, so you should stay home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are your colleagues' laughs sharply off him?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, chants, conversations in a loud voice (less when you make them above their head), paleos, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent in a loud voice.
All these may be annoying, even though they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the fault!
Ask me how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable room for the house, but is not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disregardful, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm uploading the volume.
Changes the rhythm of music and the previous tones add the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
National music life didn't get us much wrong with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems completely different this stalk when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although again the rock style garage is fashionable, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the whole of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because they cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]kinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The widest audience knew the whole that at first was acting only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they would like to wear this label.
The set reacted how it should react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It's okay the reference to the airy, the flight, but besides the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album on the Millenaris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the Mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This radio station brought to the ears of the radio transmitters the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
So everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what is it that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally for sale only, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can emerge from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between hosting your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: On the outside, especially in the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only generations of fifteen and twenty years of age frequent concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally, I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We do not make music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in the concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and did his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work as a team, trust the music presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that we compare our works with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our album.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disk and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created the choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous manner.
I remember, I was so excited then, but I naturally needed the Divas too.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: At both the concert and the album it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's only brief), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not louder than music, so music does not only accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located at the bottom.
Wisely?
B.Zs: They're at the bottom just because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn't want to distribute solo papers.
The song also relates to it, about forgetting for a while our ego, the one from which he has come and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love raise us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate the most work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing at a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything got to his place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "dropped" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
An unfaithful misleading.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, also owned by the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He intuited long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones that sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, like the Le Monde newspaper, are that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Exactly in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her come in the beginning of the year.
In February, some news about the sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had distorted the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even came to deceive the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in his business.
Risk became a benefit
Were you afraid you'd find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would cheer them up."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position it was necessary to work gradually.
He went to work at Société Genérale in 2000, just after he finished studying at Lyon.
Their annual salary was handled at $51,000.
Two years later he was already a stock exchange broker and in 2005 he became a stock exchange broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as anyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing off a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only, then, the blow came early this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all prints.
When Monday came to work, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file" Kerviel ended.
The Czech Republic has a chance to achieve 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Kronor).
This is almost half of the total amount the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion Krones from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be destined for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the resources the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund that next year will have the amount of Kronor 90.8 billion.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them less.
Twenty-year penalty for the former president of Nicaragua, the court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal decreed on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the $100 billion defalque (approximately $1.8 billion).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his estate not far from Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will be back in jail.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that German created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that it could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's vote of confidence, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, approved the new law calmly.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget heading, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three flaws that by this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as spending of the presidents that are not only pensions but also the social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clockwork pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, meaningless, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
At present they do not have this remedy.
If we only adhere to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, except Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, made much more reasonable savings than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for mass social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have been futilely swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not soon change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, ruler who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians that govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal spending of the presidents' expenses.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials for this reason we must be patient and grant this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks Want to Solve the Crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be received in the Monetary Market through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," he wrote in his report for customers, Bernard Baumohl from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them still when they decided to take this step," said ABN's main economist Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, to use the London interbank rate for the loan of money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates during the autumn several times.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," he told Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to triggering the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' Discussions Are Unbelievable
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that environmentalists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the discussions are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this theme is very important to him and that he is therefore interested.
He also expressed his joy in discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "Many times I only encounter the cartoon of my ideas."
Interested people can now be informed about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main time of the closure, he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor are they potential disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
The same subject was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore failed to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for change so officials can give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads after the new year without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not changed mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in card change, the metropolis offices are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers a day.
The queues wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of the new card.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must necessarily change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall amount to Kronor 2,500.
According to the previous information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to $30,000.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to introduce moderately up to one thousand crown fines.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Enough to bring him or send him by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year the certificates issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty to Berdych's accomplice detectives.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koęařík accused of complicity with the offender David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final expiration the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The Prague department detectives against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
The decision of today cannot be appealed against, only through the revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 persons in the robbery and the higher court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s allegations were rejected by the investigation as they were invented cases.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Koęařík.
The indictment relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permits.
In the home registry, the police found guns, ammo with a steel core, a laser controller and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other accused guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pęt and Maroš Šulej, who have for the time being avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the Czech Republic authorities.
An account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity house the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the Třebič hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve of this demand, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to make an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisory value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," stressed Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jabloh wanted, for every month, that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was developed at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress from different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by men although they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at Třebič's maternity house last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloę.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October as compensation costs for the error committed at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors you must extract from the reserve fund and you can extraordinaryly ask for help from the administrator.
The court has thus far recognized them with relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables that account for hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the litigation about the brand Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The litigation consists that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," he said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
To him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the litigation is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about orienting it towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš thought of editing the Kingdom of Valaquia passport.
From that comic origin a business and a profitable business of which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors of his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for her own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who fully dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration, among the today decomposed parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination came with the overthrow of "the king Boleslav I, the forever chosen."
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, came from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clearly could bring into the dispute, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can show up," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Overcompensated prejudices
To tell you the truth, I never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its driving features were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, exists on the market, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the header space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I move inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the design invention although already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there remain the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the abatable rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber belts that represent an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, it has a basic capacity of 428 litres, which is rather an average value compared to competition.
But not in comparison with the same type of vehicle sold most in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot stays behind with its perceptible 52 litres.
On vacation abroad or when the child's stroller is placed, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after depressing the backings of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how a 1600 should look that despised the family five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škoda then it seemed like the escape tube was taped by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 per 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbag on the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield cleaners, automated back windows...
I mean, the car with all of it, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the team's supplements in the Fabia and it'll reach a fairly similar number.
It is now only for which of the two marks to be decided.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and, therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches among students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two minor girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls hung him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us aside from throwing apples and pears at us, and then he put his pants down and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for labor reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and everything included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American time.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 20s.
He was commanded to build one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, broad avenues run cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can leave your autograph as well.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel you mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 1950s, until today, continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have rusty among these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating dramatically, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and which is highly valued by the railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for tens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brothers' models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The most well-known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not stop visiting him.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone piles and rocks of elevated slopes in the falls of the valley, and in their groves fertile lands are aclimated through which rockdales that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the habanera cigar factories can be found with your final product.
Maybe someone thinks it's interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the saw of Escambray, is such a remote place that still in the 1950s there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and, therefore, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas such as the Ancon Beach or the sugar factory valley.
the night belongs to the Casa de la Música, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city on the west end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in reality it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pure, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Sanctuary, African religion practised by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages of this.
However, as it is said, it's better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to the American Defense Minister, Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, representatives of countries with troops in the south of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone," the defense minister, Des Browne, told the BBC broadcaster.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in the Helmand province to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of whom one quarter are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assisting countries in recent months, there is a controversy over whether all the allies make the most in Afghanistan.
For passiveness he was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans in Afghanistan have a relative number of replacements.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
Sun's sensationalist newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech state, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to SEK 842.7 billion in September.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159,2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic increased to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its debt data in the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Throughout the past year, the state was entangled with more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 900,000 million and the billion crowns," he said to the iHNed.cz server, Patria Finance economist, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, also sees: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we still don't know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, state obligations, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt has now grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion.
The average state debt maturity increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent of what is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it's going to be negotiated until there's a pension reform," said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state debt management and payments strategy for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159,2 billion krona.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kronas thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion krona, the reserve of 10 billion krona for pension payments, 43 billion krona to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion krona in payments of European investment bank loans.
He compared Jartúm before a court today to give a name to a teddy bear.
The British professor tried in Sudan for insult to Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and for expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was passable by a beat-up penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Jartúm Unity High School in Sudan, has been arrested at home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, " says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed. "
The bear he - himself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only for asking children to vote for a name, " according to him, it is only a "innocent error. "
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteacher students who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and last session of discussions on Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement, " said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period, " he added, noting that "evident tensions exist. "
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 % of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika has been in charge of a new mediation by the UN last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, " said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN Kosovo administration, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found, " announced the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last-time negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was a past that has led to homicides and deportations".
" Dominant Effect "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, " declared Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must be ended as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference held by himself on Tuesday to Annapolis in Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a final regulation of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treatment" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush stated, recalling both parties' obligations regarding the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt to " conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three major dangerous problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things. "
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the future negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set the end of its coexisting " two-State " Palestinian and Israeli vision.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plane, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, " says Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspection of the French National Police (GPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
" It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating beam, " explains a police source.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. unauthorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
" He damaged the police car on the left side, after a failure to give way to the right, " says the police.
The control of alcoholemia performed on the occupants of the vehicle was revealed negative.
The state of the car (defoiled front, cracked windshields, bumpers ripped off) bears witness to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and refusal of assistance " to the IGPN, co-coordinated with the departmental direction of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the procurator specified that the investigation of the IGPN, this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-cycle arrived relatively quickly on its left. "
Yesterday, a sort of slot, undoubtedly caused by the frosting of the underwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been in a position to stop the police car.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
Both victims' bodies have been autopsed yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circled through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the cops would have left the site very quickly, not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious fault " in this regard.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which to be very prudent, " said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that just gives the scene.
" Let us come down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do. "
Then he saw "a fully terrified cop, lying.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking to the phone. "
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, in the certainty that people were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the policemen have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, the reliefs came "about twenty minutes after the police march. "
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firemen arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them, " stressed the procurator.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by the tear grenades used by the law enforcement forces, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been tried.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where cops loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been interpelled.
To Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Buthida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " called on the people to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore before Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's Promise No More "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce himself in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, at the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court, " the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer appreciates " after the emergence of the state of emergency, declared on Monday to the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform here as at 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Still today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not planned, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Population Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed better "control of fertility, " according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of pills among women aged 20 to 44 is passed from 5 % in 1970 to 60 % today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair over the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his international space station (ISS) crewmates to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to their duration, their distance from the living modules, from the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday that the astronauts had released the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece responsible for welcoming soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a type of landing platform for the laboratory modules.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module of electricity production with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module that have a size of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, deployed as accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than one metre by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had a checkout of the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters length of the remotely directed arm of the launcher added to that of the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker in the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the torso very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After having inspected precisely the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed "tablilla" types in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second " spacewalker " that had remained near the air lock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey basket wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "chapuceated" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making inventory of its instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon's rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher for the expected return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aviation and defence group has announced that it will tend to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's opening flight.
The cost of mitigating the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "EUR 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, " announced the home of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any further encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to burdens linked to delays in another programme, that of the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, on the way out of the polls: the Russians are going to make massive choices for the party of President Poutine, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs to the voters a televised message about the public chains, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be crushing.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to be transparent in receiving foreign ambassadors, happy to hand over a new burden against the West accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
" We know the price of a true democracy and wish for honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents, " he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denounces a campaign mancilled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is "never such a dirty election, even in the Eltsin era."
After the repression of the demonstrations of the last weekend, the former champion of Jacque Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo's mentality"
Behind these unsurprised legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will happen to Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to get acquainted.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, to the legislative elections as to the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mindset of homo sovieticus, they do not feel the owner of their destiny, " says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historic Nikolaï Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Poutine restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic shock " , she estimates from the Carnegie Foundation, Maria Lipman.
Today the Russians " relinquish by their own will the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why Reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: " What to reflect?
Those at power are not too bad, why change them? "
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or his rightful owners.
The eleven States responsible for its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Reasonable information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, owing to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Just as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
Records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find deported or forced labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents, " said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Search Centre at the Technische Universität of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, intra-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18 % of its external trade.
The European Union and India look forward to signing a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commissar Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union approved the European Commission last April to begin negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18 % of its external trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will greatly dope both economies " and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, " said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services " this week, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential." L' European Union and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the baseline index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected contribution of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, " notes a statement.
The bank states that £10 billion (EUR14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts liquidations on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take further steps to maintain the interbank lending rates " in line with its baseline index.
The daily interbank rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was established at 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had discouraged banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, confirmed by the evolution of the change in the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with more insured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny consideration of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which amounted to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including an increase of 50% of the employment surplus, the re-establishment of the fleeting ITPP (internal rate per oil products), a check-transport or the restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumours regarding the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival Republic.
" For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current festival movement in America, " Charlie Jones entrusted C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 at a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as " the most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
" We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked perseverantly with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia, " says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stalled in low-grade policies because of the current administration, chasing Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will take place recently in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being demarcated in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a campsite festival, while ours are held rather in urban green areas, " says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival to the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event, " says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer for this festival is "very big", as an example of the 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He says invitations have been launched to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
" Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers, " says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues who received the Top Independent Promotor Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywoodian film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions. "
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governer"?
" Be prudent, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best, " he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All Western Coast festivals, which are Sundance's, Denver's, Seattle's or San Francisco's, will have to present the Quebequesa films, give them courage and make sure the filmmakers have interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the poster to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be rally of the end of the year in stock exchange? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more because in the current context uncertainties persist in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the lean stock exchange in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing towards quality values both in long and short stages."
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decrease of the types of the Fed is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it's not a good time to venture to say there's going to be a rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks marked on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new peaks.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that "this year is about the great values."
The expert would include the two big banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Bank, assures that the rises will come from the hands of the banking and the industrial sector.
The builders may also benefit from this rally, if given.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow their own path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be a leading factor in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bassist month.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the pinching of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% rebound.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the time being the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent for the bank a big change.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to take the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated on several occasions that wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not for the public.
The results of the People's experience will be decisive for other entities to target or not this initiative that follows the timetables of the trades.
This is precisely the goal that People pursue with the project.
Capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops of the chosen streets to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but refurbishment of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with more bright colors.
The commercial banker, Ángel Rivera, claims that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, although a higher recruitment of staff, since it moves from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via Street branches of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the Worldcredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero says.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff to the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the value in Bolsa of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.'
In that sentence he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with the closure of the market by Paolo Vasile, delegate advisor of Telecinco, when he found that the chain he run doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect impeded his joy: 'it's what hurts me, not because we've grown more but because we've fallen less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That profit puts his loss in what we've been in the year at 15.66%.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other quoted communication companies is 3,571 million in Sogecable's case; 2,518,53 million Prisa (five-day publisher) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we rent it in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become the first television chain this year to exceed the billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this information was announced, the TV chain would register an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while television net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that they have maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at this time some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is explained that the expected income growth has cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability by dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractive' and business rise.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underpondering in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that they both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best rules in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities in order to ensure efficient functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, means the modernisation of financial markets, while reinforcing the protection of investors, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialized firms as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESISs), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are combined with multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all their transactions, in order to facilitate the supervision by CNMV.
In its passage through the Economic Commission of Congress, several amendments were incorporated, including that securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what has happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that diplomats in Economic and Business 30 years after the adoption of the actual decree delimiting professional functions reserved for economists in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and will be able to provide its marketing and customer-raising services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance in how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only orientative, so it does not necessarily have to match the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise of the IPC by 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has augmented that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged with regard to the progress made today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion) since they entered the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, it had accumulated record deposits over £25 billion, a figure that had progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of the money offered by the Government and which would continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank revenues that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining £18 billion until reaching the target of £30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their preferred to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Detained to the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) today early in the morning for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the head of police in the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the municipality's ruler, last May, and that according to sources of research consulted by the Cadena SER, he could be the 'cabecilla' of this plot.
Agents continue to register the municipal units and the Urbanism Counsellorship and no further arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales's lawyer, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered at the beginning of this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore afortuned, was stopped leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to the sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE's candidacy by Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced in a press conference by PSOE's Secretary of Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on 15 November his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change at university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting on his return to political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "transparency act".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry." and to make it "increasingly resemble the citizens."
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only locality in Madrid where you can't speak quietly and quietly is Congress, the president of the government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good doing" and he has not wanted to see his position already occupying so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "preponderance".
Climate propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to immeasurable persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And moreover, a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach compels him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leadership in non-Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors it has taken place and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain to the Spanish with the utmost clarity what steps you are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be any such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costful, uncomfortable and threatening accounts for companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for electoral campaigns that he doesn't speak or denounce or demand, but he decorates the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend to move by bicycle or cool with the fan.
Detained by the mayor and the chief of the local police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the City Council secretary and a host businessman for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The edil was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units he is currently located next to numerous agents, who have also visited the Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Soil.
These three arrests add to the six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the summary, which was instructed by Totana's Judgment No. 1.
The first six detainees have been brought to court today.
According to the sources, Totana's former ruler and today the PP's autonomous parliamentarians, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current bride of the former ruler, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Vigués lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as did Pablo José M.G., director of Souelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the mentioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been performed.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of requalified land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the viguese parking lots of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focusing on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way in head of the PISA report on the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal disks of less than EUR 400 in the store, it is simply considered to be missing (Article 623(1)).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 from the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains less than the penalty imposed on the store (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains less than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous dispute is punishable from three months to one year (Criminal Code, art. 154) and the exchange would be punishable from six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without authors ' authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting his hand off, a very long hand.

My head doctor takes me one of his articles on rare research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the comrades earn.
The study has been performed through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers noted that if both were successful they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if I needed this conclusion so much science.
The Balkans Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting the war criminals in the Balkans since the Office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a sweet taste, because the principals responsible for the killing of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
His names are on that list from which he takes his title from the documentary of Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla list' (2006, not premiered in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the fence.
What's it for?
Automobile insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, is an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, seniority of the card, civil status, type of vehicle to be secured or used, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is entered into in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for taking responsibility for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account a number of factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, civil status, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use of it, among others.
Insurers set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that more likely to suffer an accident, more cost to be paid.
That is why both women and older than 25 have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinisterity due to their prudence.
Also, by taking the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are in a variety of disadvantages when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the limited driving experience and the old age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well-insured is a safe at all risk, there are other more economic options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer pays part of the amount of the loss.
"The portion of the amount of the loss provided by the client will be preset according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," explains Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection from damage caused to third-party, but not to those caused in his own car.
Besides, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid the accidents as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction over the company's base rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic fee.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the profit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will be possible to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old strip drivers have it easier to hire a insurance, as the sinisterity index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to take a full risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the last time the 'novice'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable that he negotiates a insurance at all risk, provided that his economic situation permits him, of course.
Marriage with children, for their part, is considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinisterity, so the surcharge will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (which may be EUR 300), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of vehicle life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," Luis Noguera judgment.
For retirees, insurance at all risk is recommended with franchise (which is EUR 150), or one extended to third parties when a high level of bonus is available.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point worth the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the 'Champions' league, as Italians serve to be first and Scottish to sentence their rankings.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, who has four points, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan has to contest the Club World in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a square by the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in the eighths.
The whole Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to rank if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because at nine points equal the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to bite the Scottishs at night, who trust in getting into the eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and in a consecutive way, after they were precisely defeated in that round last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after 0-0 on the way.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to which only the triumph is worth, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighths and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and no choice to follow in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 viewers, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that made anger at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out on stage showing some bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham had given them.
The athlete was among the crowd that was packing the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room, at all, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" led to the dissolution of the quintet two years later, he also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last acted together in 1998.
Initially, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, they were expected by an army of nannies.
Between five there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7th).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each spray between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed to paying 50 per cent extra in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be Ukraine to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, said a vigilante.
The recommendation of auditor general Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area following attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the airport's terminal building doors.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bombing in the United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates, to ensure that they comply with qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background controls, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The auditor ' s report recommends, inter alia, that the boards should have the guide to the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
BMA President Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, partly because boards have problems identifying employees who have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely implemented.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreign pre-employment policy and guide in the NHS.
The Health Secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "I had a great interest in this work being carried out as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in the film awards
Control, the biographical film on Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named the best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows the rise to Curtis' fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - with soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But the winner was also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of the album Joshua Tree de U2, awarded two prizes - to better director and better debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film about the Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor took him Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris prize for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Crawl".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, thus named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the entry for smuggling of eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping the Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants to Al-Qaeda to fight the allied forces and to support the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnies.
Al-Qaeda militants look at many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-occidant government of the country - had as their targets residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, for five months of work," said the interior minister's spokesman to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus Climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European orbited spacecraft showed the planet more similar to a Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission states: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two such similar planets.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police seized "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
Cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put in the afternoon of Wednesday November 28 were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one issue, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked an indecisive group of voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas that they liked: the issuers noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchanges of words of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been pointed out in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked whether any candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but they both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the toxic toys of China and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other subjects appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincident with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his warm statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both party wings.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but equally emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They don't seem to have sold influences, nor are these exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor are they sucking off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Government Party, of over £650,000 (1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chapuza.
A threesome of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time employment.
Now they are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, which is not long left, that suspension is more than that: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government puts itself on the defensive and does not focus.
In one part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Even if I wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax on authority are related to Brown's decisions as Chancellor of the Age.
And even though it is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "partner-effective", the investigation of the financing of the political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The irons aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been fraudulent directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not taken by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who told Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fund-raising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making for a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Commission on Standards in Public Life, since he hasn't had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the laborers with the Tories, and perhaps a resignation of the special financial situation with the trade unions -marginal measures for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan acts.
The conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Card sharks
The mortgage crisis subprimes is it infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that loss on credit cards can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprime contaminates other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million positions in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it's too early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3,89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law of people (2005) resulted in a sharp fall in bankruptcy requests, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of moratoriums) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the liquidity flow than the active securities, so that falling prices do not necessarily drive a change in borrowers' credit capacity.
They can even work to benefit issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexiblely to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That, in theory, should reduce the risk of rapid asset retention.
"We're not gonna wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Finance of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America to recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
We have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for collaborating with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, your case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to alert Fastow in 2002 that it was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his crash spiral in bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three British knew it would value upward.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7,3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12,3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two charges of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a penalty of three years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they needed to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed business seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned prisoners in the past years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionary Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the newly wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from caoba crafted yachts to diamond-incrusted car grilles, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks captively at a bright orange Porsche on his neighbor's stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed of fuel by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at a peak.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
In another location in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH's president, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the rich second grade include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank you.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 % of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," Yumatova said, reeled off the design suit he used as a veteran red carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mix brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuts, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables on order, Dubai apartments and Gund's teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly on a stand of Dutch royal porcelains Delft, in front of a wall size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, vendors said that the richest Russians of more career (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousands of people — cash millionaires, millionaires or tourists — fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director general of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski color crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants bulldozer leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian Millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, he's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with a million-dollar fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or packing up a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "chapuza" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the "A little healthier" restaurant window and saw an ambulance climbed over White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car appeared from the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance rise," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at Av. West Scott's 212 house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that has regretted the top ranks of Newark's police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Drink Control Commission, and left two children 14 and 11 years old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house arrived about 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead in the place.
It's been more than a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say if Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marching rosel is located on the front of the house, and a dalmate barks on the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainillina ethyle" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was located at the door of the garage, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this or that one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut the fees to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm the credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the central bank of the United States.
The stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit markets, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "partly invested by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments to the financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by the investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize the credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the US economy, such as the sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labour force, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close to 13,289.40, while the large S&P 500 rate rose by 2,65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 rate rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of Britain's first-class companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit tension in markets after a strong demand in a three-month auction from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, tensioned the credit and rates of the three-month "Libor" loans among the British banks, meant the highest rise since September, of 6,59%, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with judgment
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is beginning to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in one part time.
A failure to get the sixth bat place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments that always end up being subjective are required.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give you the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to set up at the same time who became an important player, and despite scoreing a hundred double against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today's Asgiriya stadium, will follow their instincts of conservation and promote Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his bright and valuable debut test from the beginning of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the Lords trial, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some elan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team is happy to live on swords.
He took on nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not go out, as tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first Iraqi refugees buses from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he states, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that a U.S. ally force helped get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from home in Sleikh to northern Baghdad by a grenade attack, after which he urged citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops established groups of "worried citizens", armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many stated that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave a voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian squads of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting Iraqi visas, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnies have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sarlans lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic bike over themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre education system, which in a study by the German Economy Institute (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
Thus, traditional higher schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
So far students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The Sarre takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Economy Institute (IW).
More than every five young people do their high school in the Professional School. So, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first study of PISA, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to begin as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of arrears in school development declined from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the disgust of the Sarlans, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that Sarlans are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
In Venezuela there will be another time gap different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is currently staying as a comic book in Spain.
As reported in the Venezuelan State Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time will be less than four GMT hours.
Thus the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed the obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be broadened considerably.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla involving the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes a feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions of the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wage threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation calculations, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretch of food and energy prices," he reported to the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of the economic cycles.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance can also be borne by employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to another is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like Earth, something that has not been raised so far. The European "Venus Express" probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and swivels in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like that: if there was ever a life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the Venus surface there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, fluctuating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "devil" twin from Earth, but he remains a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had imagined," reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbit around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble the Earth much, scientists leave the base that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had been agglomerated and on earth remained in the oceans, but in Venus it dissolved into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute effect to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the process of foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of A China's policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his dislike for the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellor's Office led to great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances such as those in France will occur.
Battles with the police on the streets, shooting, burning of cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with guns: after severe riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also note that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It's still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people starred in serious disturbances on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite all this, the performances are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany rather than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to " give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training job faster".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous action until it is necessary.
On Monday night to Tuesday, about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more must be expected from it.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate in the Lower Chamber, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
As for the reproach made to her for having repeatedly devoted herself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that that would be a provincial way, and so he showed that he did not want to understand what the critics are interested in.
In the Lower Chamber, it was very clear to all that this reproach was appropriate.
We could not feel a slight interest, or any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: he praised himself very much for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but he does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford such modesty.
For he is engaged in expressions so that people can gain momentum.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and concern for low-wage workers?
The only thing you do is talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It's impressive how many times you're wrong about talking when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It began to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a clash in a heated debate of presidental pre-candidates from YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions among candidates have already been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he had turned New York into "a shelter for illegal immigrants".
He, for his part, responded with serious reproach: "I wanted to say that his own home was a "door" for the illegal." Giuliani responds to the former ruler of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favourite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the CNN debate, especially to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second small videos, filmed by internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from Vietnamese war veterans, when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding " as torture, a method of interrogation, by allowing a person to drown to simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important themes of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney compunged and apologizes to people and the television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani President made himself swore as president.
Thus ends the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after power was made with an intrusive military coup, the former General for the first time ruled the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the position of Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main status of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf oath, will soon annul the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many supportive jurists of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the North Watiristán region, five soldiers were killed and four were injured.
According to reports from the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are coming back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restar was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written at the best time of the band.
At that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each one of them has before it his drawer, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's passionate people was the fact that the Harmonia band made music again.
What needs to be rebelled here is the following: the questions with precision have shown that the band's name repulsed in people's minds, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the wrong Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to the members of the band Can 2003 of Cologne for their work of life, the hall could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band The Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers' concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are only one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it later obtained it thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in Berliner Schaubuehne's basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf which was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, an association banderin of Ottenstein's Harmony chanting appeared in garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, nearly 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up in esoterism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has been more successful since that time than Harmony had.
The album live recording in Griessmer, that must be thankful to Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company was set to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like Roedelius' work, the Neu! band was discovered again.
Harmonia's presentation as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock on the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently, electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who deepen the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere he coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always an English term of origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genus was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams here "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage you think very well about what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break your nerves or give you a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again engaged in war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At the beginning there were good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch maybe the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he's after" (Why nowadays the titles of the movies have to be so long and triggered?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have already passed, who, as a monument of the ruin of his decadence, so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian sniper from Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm was Cobra 11" without a motorway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about war in the Balkans.
Another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard on two charges), the story about American reporters in the war that are leaving to detect a war criminal Serb called "horse," could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and it is every time a journey in madness.
A reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are presented to Simon Hunt at the beginning, to him who is not allowed to be simply a cynical with heart.
No, the script also envisages a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will later kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters quickly achieved what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinemalogical logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about chasing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that it's hard to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film about the holocaust with the film "The Schindler List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics like the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the slightest reparation (which is necessary to be able) in narrating good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The great dictator" turned out at the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to film a movie.
Perhaps you should be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When they asked him about the parallels between his historic novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed and war in Yugoslavia will always reign.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that it is necessary to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, said on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic site".
Last time no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political momentum, sporting at the same level, could not be maintained."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics would not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Federation (Sportbund) decision expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we so far thought we would have until 2028, we will not have any chance from a realistic point of view."
Despite everything, this dream didn't end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if the plans are now ruined," said Wednesday Günter Ploß, HSB's director.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement made at a reception by the head of the Senate on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities of 2015 not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of higher schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) fraction reproached the Senate that it would not take such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olimpia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU underscored the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes in 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the other "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation in the international art market, are also proven.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museum Moderna Museet were exposed hundreds of Brillo-carton boxes. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but exemplaries (which were just objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of wooden shining boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now talk about almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brill-Boxes" of "Type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased at auctions for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and smelted their tight silvers and then painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without printing the pressed silvers directly. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum Museet and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibition objects."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "great accusations" involving soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had been trapped in a hotel in Manila had surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that she couldn't answer for bloodshed.
The soldiers faithful to the government had robbed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers have been trapped in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were tried on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police who were to monitor him had gone to their ranks and followed their riot.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who used to run the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great government critics called on Thursday for a big demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been reproaching for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempts to strike the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunication company.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
It's only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital subscriber line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the participation securities for a third party.
The United Internet already on the previous day involved Drillisch's telecommunication company with almost 10 percent.
Drillisch, in the measure of capital expansion, placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased from them 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on marketing cooperation for DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," said United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded a joint company MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of 10 percent to Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. they make participation of 18,49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market for Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a complete contract.
So far United Internet and Drillisch's holding had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's participation.
Then they agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
