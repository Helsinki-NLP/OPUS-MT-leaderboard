A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found.
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night in Tampere.
The report on the disappearance of a boy from Western Tampere with his friend has been disseminated in social media.
According to the police station, there's been a connection with the boy, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told him at the middle of the night, that he's been found.
He's all right, and now we're going to start the post-explanatory.
The boy was found in the surroundings of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again in the wild, broke the paint difference to the Mess.
Christiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League on the weekend and continued his factory work in the Master League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo over the league of the Masters was at least a moment in the interest of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the painter statistics of all time when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network two hits of punishment kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his painted aldoon to 80, when before Tuesday with him, the Barcelona Mess, who was reequivocating with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has been struggling in the Italian football team in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Master's League's D section, it started vigorously with 2-1-victims from Manchester City.
The victory hall made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored Sergei Aguero's absence.
Aguero, wounded at the game of the valioliga at the end of the week, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second company United also experienced hard hits in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 loss.
The visit of the 20-year-old ManU, Luke Shaw, took only 15 hours.
PSV's dangerous-looking glitter of Hector Moreno hit the target on the ManU package that was attacked so bad that Shaw probably broke the weather.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's homestadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital care.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41 minutes to 1-0, but the pleasure of ManU took only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before a break in an extra time.
In the second half of the time, the PSV's winning score was made by Luciano Narsingh.
A section of Paris Saint-Germain began in the League of Masters of the Season of Art.
There was an Argentine Angel Di Maria, who changed the PSG-nut shirt in Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball across the back of Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a second half PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been betted on by the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best possible reference point in the League's small series.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a PSG star attacker, first encountered his professional career as a result of Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president made the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Mr Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
MDC's main opposition party called on Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred only at Mugabe's precinct and that the president had done nothing wrong.
The speech of Mugabe discussed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
The request will be evaluated by Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council at the summits.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Mr Merkel, at the table of the Interior Ministers.
The teacher admits that he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
Sounds like a little colorful university teacher Shannon Lamb will tell the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the cops have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contacts of the dead woman's neighbors were found on this phone.
The police inside the house found Amy Prentiss' body and glimpse on the page handwritten message: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said in a letter that experts say is signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe that he shot and killed the historian teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford reported that staff at the University heard a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose one more: Lamb committed suicide when the police surrounded the voice.
The authorities still tried to find out Lamb's motive day after students and staff had had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lambi as a talented teacher, but who might have had problems.
The students said they waited for her hours.
The police of Prentiss' death station, Gautir, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had incorporated Lamb's written book in which he thanked "fabulous people", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them taught at a social science and history institution with a total of 17 staff members, and many students participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambia, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lambin told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 year.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave at Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's wage principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral value, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
University Director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that "evidently there was something in Lamb's mind."
These questions are no longer answered by Lamb.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Mississipin Greenville, said Methel Johnson, the D.C. Investigator.
Lamb's car was still running on the yard.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through common friends.
Hairsto's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, and now he told us about the 40-year-old Hairston who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lambi, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together in some of the jobs.
O'Steen told me his daughter makes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online businesses.
Mike Shaffer, bartender of The Julep Room near Gautiere, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss the last night against September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lipstick show to the rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were screwing and throwing socks at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year seminar of students and specialized in Indians and the history of colonial times, said school teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little kids.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was the chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night, at Cleveland, the Delta State campus held a candlestick exercise involving some 900 people, including teachers and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the show, during which the college choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississip Cleveland.
Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississipin Greenville, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans, participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by saying that the police are now saying that Lamb called after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many workers for holidays as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to make more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, with 45,000 employees employed during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "reffee" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film's return to the future was for Michael J. Fox's professionally important moment.
It was also worthwhile for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I sat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said to be coming a documentary film in the Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and I think it's funny that I'm just a fake shot and a hand stretched away from the date with the Wales Princess.
Back in Time is a documentary of a future film interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "It's the most wonderful time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN leader says that Syria's situation is not solved armedly
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "does not resolve armedly" and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called upon all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban reported that he intends to meet with the ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the General Assembly's week of ministers later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban urged the five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis in dealing with the solidarity and consensus they showed in agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 of the results showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a windscreen.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for a collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to remove Donald Trump from the tip of the standstills, it has not (old) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in the ten Donald Trump has been led by a two-digit chapter, and some have begun to seriously wonder what this means for real estate appointments.
Of course, the election season is only in the early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a candidate for Republicans.
The commentators note that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the emerging Herman Cain, none of whom received any state back in the process of nomination.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation Club for Growth, have noted Trump's firmness and started to use his funds for his collapse.
The following recent statements indicate that the real estate king is not only a transitional phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, Monmouth University's support surveys showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they're negative.
These figures are also true in the first predecessor states.
Last week, at the Quinnipic University's stand-up survey in Iowa, 60% of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "happy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "confused," if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same levels of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent of "inspired" versus 40 per cent of Trump).
Next, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unhappy" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush became a candidate for the favourite rulings.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speech and offenses, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has an appropriate character for the president.
According to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipic, in the state of Iowa's first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has an appropriate character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent believe that his character is not suitable for acting as President, and nearly six out of ten believes that his nature is not part of the White House.
The Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump as the most likely option in asking who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the most brightest possible crystal ball available.
During the last election period, four out of ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry was nominated candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican Party consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as Trump's anti-Trump support has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey conducted at the beginning of September at Monmouth University showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, as well as Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at every 33 points.
He's at the level with Ted Cruz.
The only winner of Trump?
If they were put against them, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that he made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of Trump's voters have decided who their voice goes to.
Naturally, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely certain to say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign start-up speech, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's power of power drives the Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damages re-brand companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The depletion of government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now cover about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa were frustrated at the Republican Congress: 54 per cent were "unhappy" and 21 per cent were "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first meeting at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first meeting at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corby meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will rise up on his first six questions a little later than half a day, and probably both the media and the members of the Labour Party will be vigilant about his performance.
Corby has demanded for this weekly show "minor theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Unions' Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand silent during the national song in the memorial service of Tuesday, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the British Air War, has raised criticism of the conservative party with representatives of the people and has appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has drawn attention
Corbyn's representative said his "sense respectfully quiet" and that he acknowledges "the bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the British Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, told the BBC Twon Newsnight program that he would have invited the Labour Party leader to sing a national song despite his view that the King's House should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's interior, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and initially less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as the leader.
BBC's policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in line with regard to the role of the party in the European Union and the government's grant ceiling have also "grown" within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the NCA that the Labour Party is making a change that would remove the entire roof.
A few hours later, the Secretary of the Shadow Government for Labour and Pension Smith said that the party was "overly clear" as to their only opposition to the government's plans to calculate the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has encountered over the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to the policy and now reports that he has "enhanced" ideas as questions to the Prime Minister and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's questioning hours is too opposite and that he intends to abstain from both clever speech and spitting, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Secretary of Finance of the Shadow Government, Angela Eagle, is in place of his questioning sessions when Corby is not participating - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the lower room, John Bercowi.
When Cameron came up in 2005 he said he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often linked to the Prime Minister's questions, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since they began to be television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the manager's discretion, his sub-room management, and his position with other representatives, even though the critics have criticized the questioning lessons that have become only a slump that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Unhomely young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former streets have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where young people without homes are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and gain from it.
BBC News met one of the first young graduates of the project.

The value of the price rises as the UK increases wage growth
The value of the price jumped upwards after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, British salaries, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring together an assessment of the increase in rates.
The price rose by over one per cent against $1.5505, and by 0.84% against € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed to 6229.21 in an increase of 1.49%.
SABMiller was the most distinguished market share and increased by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world's largest bakeries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after the competitive luxury group in Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and in addition, they showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 per cent after the mine-leader reported that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating the shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the form "sold".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sporting clothing company published its half-year income before taxes: 83 per cent increased to 46.6 million pounds.
According to JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage is raised in Britain, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
Expenditures could be targeted at company enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grass root campaign against intrusion in Ald's area
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and West Australia before the Aldi $700 million attack.
At the same time, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through mainstream and social media marketing and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Dunsborough's ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer tastes in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their bottom customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organizes an annual strategy investor's day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and West Australia total nearly 30% of the Metcash IGA trade area, and there are higher profit margins than the Eastern Metcash State IGA network.
South and West Australia's purchases are well known to be corners, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the west compared to 14 per cent in the east.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two Länder within 12 months of the opening of the first moves.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose 360 million dollars per year on sales and Metcash can lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up in the south of next year 25 and 30 moves in the west, resulting in the turnover of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can pay Metcash about $13 million in profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern Länder, mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA customers were all the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
The director of the investment fund last week and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "well possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash Government had contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and the profits from Metcash's food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA resellers, have decreased by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and marginalisations are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler holds its side and has invested more than $150 million each year in calculating the prices of hundreds of products on a weekly basis to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA resellers to refurbish shops by increasing more rapidly growing fresh food, and by placing on the market a better range of private brands.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of profit growth in 2017, for the first time four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer side by side in a recent storm that has grieved around his friend Nick Kyrgyz. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy.
A two-year youngest member of the "Special Ks" called Kokkinakis was unwilling to be released in a case where Kyrgyzstan Wawrinka was irritated by Kyrgyzstan at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in a fiery carnival match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to twice separate the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have hacked Kyrgyzstan, and I should beat that kid."
Although the last time he was seen to break his bat after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unbeatable defender of the Kokkinakis.
Right now a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth for another place in two games with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into a rag," Healy said.
He broke his bat by losing a cramp at the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently well, also in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves some compliments.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years, he works hard, he fits into the team and so on, he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good condition and he is quite peaceful and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to participate in the important games that start on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still supporting the Canberrian return to the team's regular furniture.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on all polemics around [Cyrgyrus]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as for example Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public in considering these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia by arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of preying on the flow of migrants coming to the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who escaped the violence of their home countries have now set up their tents and settled for an undefined period of time between two inspection stations.
However, inefficiency grew.
As the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and cried offenses against the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary when more and more people arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred after the 28th group of nationalities failed in the creation of a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they wished to talk about the conclusion of a final agreement - by the end of next month or next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will call for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be shut down and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a part of its anti-Roman border to stop the flooding of immigrants across the country.
CBS News' correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and from the other part of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not those who escape under war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the company crosses or damages a 4-metre (13-foot) squash wire built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"As a result of the situation caused by immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring an emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, the government's informant, told newspapermen in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear about this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the military installation expected for the next week, but the Associated Press journalists on the border have seen heavy armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the Orban Homeland Security Adviser, said that 45 people had been captured by the authorities in their attempts to cross the border, as well as 15 people already beyond the country.
They were able to cross the fence by harming the fence, are now being imprisoned by the police, and are charged with violations defined in new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the anti-Serbia border after they had sent a trailer covered with wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Hungary's Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal box for human treatment and the crowds entered.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands were out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership of Bernie Sanders has declined on the side
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues in two-digit leadership in the nomination of the Democrats' race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is holding on to him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the Democrat voters (down from 58%) and the second Sanders supports 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrat voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the preliminary elections, most of the voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided on who to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more tightly than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined in several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's advance in the area of democrat voters under 50 years of age has lost, and he is now at a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading with the electorate.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-numbered chapter with Liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the voters in the country say that they are zealously supporting Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
Fourthly, he says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The opinions are more confusing for those who are not in favour of Clinton at the moment - only a quarter would support him zealously.
Where 48 per cent of the Democrat voters say that they would zealously support Clinton, the first Republican male Donald Trump says that the fewer Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has an appropriate experience (16%). The most popular responses were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President influences the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the Democrat voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagrees.
Asking the democrats who they would choose for the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the nomination of the Democrats, the leadership of Hilary Clinton will grow from Sanders. If Biden leaves, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of the voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
On this scale, Biden will remain far away, but the share of those who consider him the most voting has grown.
When asked what was most important in the candidate, however, they raised their views ahead of voting.
Also last month, no candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues among the voters of their parties.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is the best cop with the triangle in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
30% of the voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When we look at all these issues, about a quarter of the voters say that they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server as Minister of Foreign Affairs still raises questions, most of the voters are pleased with his explanation and say that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March shortly after the daylight.
Most Americans say that they did not have an impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinions on Clinton have deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinions about Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, and only 32% think he is honest and reliable, and this figure has calculated 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters throughout the country do not regard Trump as honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Six of Biden, Carson, and Bush, who are involved in the study, are considered the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion on him, just like Carson does not.
The error margin in a study involving 351 democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national questionnaire
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new questionnaire, leaving others to fight the footsteps.
The Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the survey published on Tuesday, before last month's Fox News election claim, from 23% of the CBS survey published on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, Carson rose from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is in the process of separating Trump's high-skilled Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Governor Scott Walker's support for Wisconsin has fallen the most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, are at the third level in 6%.
The error margin in the sample of the last 376 Republican voter survey in September is +/-6 per cent.
Last week's CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in polls: he has 19 per cent support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32 per cent.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgery for nothing, although Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday in his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died in the Simplification ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, five people have been charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and later delayed his taking to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag of more than 13 kg full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurts, and then he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members didn't call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but they said they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to search for online information on his symptoms, and to contact the national president of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told us at the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically set the brotherhood before Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He didn't get Deng to rejoin, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng has repeatedly hit the head, body and thighs of a boring object.
"Too many families have been forced to suffer from brotherhood incitement, when at least one student has died annually since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step by the authorities.
The grand jury in Monroe County advocated that the first five members would be charged with murder in third grade.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent seduction and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held accountable only by individuals. If there is an organization behind what happened that accepted the situation either formally or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood from delisting their contacts with the local department.
This is what happens when the United States Central Bank raises interest rates
The interest rate rise will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes or how long it takes.
The past hardly helps with the timing, specifically in the economy.
The return has lasted after the first lift sometimes only 11 months, sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the United States Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, the US Central Bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly in the development cycle of the normalisation of the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can find that all interest rate humiliation has been over-limited.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis of the Central Bank is inevitably interpreted in some circles to end the 'wanted money' era," said the main economic expert for Capital Economics in Julian Jessop's message to customers.
Rather, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, levels are such a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that it would not have an impact.
Below is a review of how some economic areas will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen on the market over the last month or so, waiting for a raise of interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It seems that capital gains tend to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent investigation of what happens after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, about 14 per cent higher when the increase is approaching, 250 days later the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2,6 per cent), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with the average return in the last six cycles of 14,4 per cent, is reported in the recent analysis of Bob Doll's capital strategy leading to the Nuveen Asset Management company, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when the returns begin to fall.
Falls are part of the economy, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been present before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product which will be the closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has been only twice below 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will last after the third quarter has reached 1.5 per cent, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
The rise of interest rates in such a fragile economic regulation may be risky and raise the question of ‘is this time different', Deutsche Bank stated.
The market partners have reserved themselves for the increase of the Central Bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategic and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade forecasts only 25% of the probability.
"Our research shows that, since 1950, all increase cycles have so far occurred in a growing leverage effect in supercycles where GDP has passed its peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been overly waiting for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months.
Fixed returns have also been unstable in the expectation of interest rates, and the model reflects some of the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be seen faster in debt books than in shares.
The direction of debt books' returns appears to change immediately in the first increase/cutting cycle.
At the end of the elevation cycle, the return on debt books will drop immediately," Deutche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a convergence of the profits of longer and shorter debt books, thus balancing the return curve.
High-profit bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious with regard to profit-seeking," Schwab's fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones said in a analysis.
Amazingly, Jones believes that the market has already been adapted to the central bank's line-up expectations.
"In addition to the fall in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the more stringent monetary policy perspectives," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is more balanced, the credit margins have increased and the volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly invested in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will get worse when the dollar increase makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable after the first interest rate in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to customers.
Undertakings with strong turnover exceeded the low turnover after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility shares were more successful than low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become a big problem.
"The companies that owe a lot of interest rates are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside the exchange bargaining, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also gain with higher outputs, even though experts disagree on how quickly it feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative People's Representative Andrew Bingham is accusing the channel of "nationalisation"
He claims that its separation from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult.
In addition, he took on the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitated the Brit Awards.
Mr Collins criticized The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims the leading MP to increase the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative People's Representative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "nationalize" its content and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "nationalisation" - is becoming Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Award, which was launched last December.
"Last year, the BBC Music Awards has only appeared to be the Brit Awards gallery under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I remember directly about when in fact you're just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
BBC's CEO disputed the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its trading partner in terms of live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, of the first class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Previously this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory Party MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition purchased by BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, according to estimates of 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way self-significant?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George act as star performers, has been produced "in the style of BBC".
He added that he wants the production company "to find success inside his own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future periods of The Voice, or to prescribe that the money of the licensed payers should be used in other forms of entertainment.
Online sales have risen so far in the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, there was an increase after the beginning of low statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales confirmed the use of mobile equipment to purchase
Experts believe that the Black Friday of November may contain consumption.
Virtue shopping has grown sharply for over a decade and has transformed many of the British shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
The overall consumption of August grew less then the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent of last year's increase.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling of online sales when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalised over time," Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales reporter, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made online purchases and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it's flattening, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowdowns.
Experts believe that consumers will curb the purchases before the last Friday.
Last year, five times the usual average purchasers flipped on their computers to pick up shops, pouring down many merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which led the buyers to argue about the discoveries, can curb the purchases.
The study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using the fashion chains of buyers.
Muslims bury the deaths of Meka's elevation accident, the consequences of Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mekah
Saudi Arabia has partly accused of the collapse of the construction site of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the lift collapsed
29 The dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them; and the victims died when the climber collapsed in the great Mosque of Mekah.
Mainly, the white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moissem.
The sad passage passed through the holy place, where only a few days ago the lifting hurricane fell through the mosque's roof and poured down worshippers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family building group to be responsible for a disaster, including 394 people injured.
The killing of 29 corpses of worshipers of the mechanic's great mob was carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram Bolton, from Manchester, and he was on his first pilgrimage when the climb collapsed.
Akram had been in great trouble with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj-Sacre.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that hajj Meka will continue when thousands are constantly arriving in the city.
Today King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the elevator 15 when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic-language version stated that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it stated that the company's directors were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out what caused the fall of the hummingbird into the courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the hajj-sacre that took place this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the rude collapse and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the group that it did not use up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifting gulls around the mechanic, which are part of the huge construction clash led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruler family for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The fall took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions of people arrive in the Kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities allocated a million rhes (174 000 pounds) to the deceased and permanently injured.
Other injured people get half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind popularity.
The British are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result of Screwfix trades for professionals, 200 more will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q sales around the country
Writer Rupert Steiner, City's main correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and painters, and they prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs.
Looks like if you're sharp with a hammer or a hammer to paint walls, you're in a minority today.
You see, the British are increasingly hiring assistants to take care of the tea-se-self-work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new director-general of Kingfisher's home remodel chain, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a price of mockery.
This leads to Kingfisher's planning to open up 200 new Screwfix trade for workers and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Laury said that she wants more women to work for B&Q shops, because of the eight ten purchase decisions made in the stores that are specifically made by a more beautiful sex.
Nowadays, most of the personnel are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: nowadays there are more than one woman's economies that do more home rehabilitation than before.
Laury said, "The greatest part of the staff in our shops is still men.
We need to find a better balance.
But half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who lead the UK FTSE100's main companies, and has rebuilt its management team in such a way that it has equal men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with just 50% women in the group, including its Director-General and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the diversity is important here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' earnings and sales after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is opening up 200 new moves
The three-Ace government decided to rely on compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
So the visible effects were made quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SGC and other employees' associations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the broad expression of workers' minds.
A lot of people think that's when it comes to making sense, too.
Let's ask if it's good for a strike, when it's bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in the manifestation, but to go to work.
In the old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online where to protest, but openly declaring itself a scoundrel would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of members of trade unions protested by a few ten thousand people not much for a moment, but it gives reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the strong solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, the unions are finally getting involved, namely, the workers' rights to defend, visually and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Let us be of any opinion about the activities of the organisations, so it's bullshit that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still falling and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would make everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduced by 130
The Lappeenranta Technical University begins with a savings facility, which aims to reduce expenditure by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of savings, the University will start all staff negotiations with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, the aim of other activities is to save two million.
In the context of the negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce some 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditures will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university's overall budget is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between Massive teaching and research operations and the reduction of corporate funding with our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks by law.
Yle: Onnibus Wants Finland's Railways
Onnibus owner, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland's rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest UK rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the near traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After nearby traffic, there's remote traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport, Yle, will welcome the plans of Onnibus.
At least Transdev (formerly Veoli) has reported interest in rail transport by other international companies, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow the page when the United States Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they first raise interest rates for almost a decade.
As Reuters asked the 80 economic scientists a little over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, since the central bank cut interest rates to zero is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well and recovery has brought billions of dollars to balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore less rose global perspectives.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lifting, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleague later on that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "unhappy" for the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississip Gautir police told me that Delta State University's science and social science teacher Lamb called emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his house.
He said "he killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that the house has a "sold dog", which "doesn't bother anyone", but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for shooting.
When the police arrived, there was a 41-year-old body of Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb's handwritten message saying, "I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who's ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers into Delta State, where he killed historian teacher Ethan Schmidt before eventually killed himself late Monday when the police surrounded him.
University Director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that "evidently there was something in Lamb's mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb had believed that Prentiss was related to Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any "trimelodrama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
Couple divorced 15 years ago, but he remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "exhausted."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughter were "all best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online at his home, and Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had dated Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lamb that he called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that he's not going to prison.
When the cops reached Lamb's highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and went running into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education science in Delta Statesta in spring 2015, reports a list of earnings on the university website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
He also had drug problems, according to rumors, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of the double-burning.
Luke Shaw got a double burn on his right foot when Manchester United lost PSV Eindhoven in the Master League fight.
Even though the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury caused by Héctor Moreno's uncontrollable attack at 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had landed in the PSV area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his feet and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and now it happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double franchise, and he won't play in the block phase.
I hope he'll be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a punishment shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian journalist made a mistake.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot coupling.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you all for your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out for this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played against the Dutch Van Gaal in the 2014 World Championships team.
"Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see that situation.
The only thing that I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tacla.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, doesn't he?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't last long until it's almost out.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the first minister asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss The Lorax, a story on environmental protection published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on the website of the SuperCamps company and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and containing a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book for my children because it always seems to find a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next song in which Cameron presumably describes the book's plot is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to a rather short original text.
"In the city inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a trade, Ted-boy hopes to win her dreams to her heart by fulfilling the desire of Audrey to see the right tree," the text says and describes the love story that Dr Seuss, right-named Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write in 1991.
If this is not yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text sounds positioned as if it had been taken from the Lorax film plot on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In a city inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams on the side of the Audrey girl's heart."
In view of the fact that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexperienced with the book. In that young, anonymous son hears how the local nature has destroyed greed, scourge trees and needs, Kerskanen, without conveying to the story the short, fissile creature of Lorax, who "speaks for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR mission is probably an outsourcing assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text must have come from the Cameron district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of staying aside from the British team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for tour, I do not think that the recent 3-0 series of loss is likely to happen again.
I wouldn't shut a guest profit out of the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but it involves good rounds and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in its spin-offs and Adil Rashid is an attacker's option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related to the subject: Adam Lyth fell from the British cricket team, his place is Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I'm his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
Joe Root's choice, for example, had no uncertainty before the bulletin, because, as I have said before, players are the best players to choose.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
English Chief Coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's hard to answer the question how long the hitter gets to leave a trace.
Lyth was elected seven times as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the chance to play both home and in the guest.
The only subject of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in the top shape, but it was lost the opportunity now is the past.
Alex Hales comes with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he did 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this is, of course, dependent on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a balloon of Moeen's idea of hitting next to Cook, bringing an extra pitcher to the field but keeping four fast, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moe did not necessarily do his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is the third to them and there is little difference there.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first row when he fell before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a thieve, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he feels very impressive from a young man.
People can look at his unbeatable statistics hitting average 31, with a ball 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many feeders available, and the pickers chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter, Mahela Jayawardene, as consultant to the games can prove to be a genius stamp.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the games of the white ball, and brings with him both energy and an unforgettable discouragement.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in the international cricket, whether it was playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of exploitable awkwardness as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message would be the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, rests in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and choices do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
The UK's departure from the EU (Brexits) can be profitable if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-violence re-conferencing strategies to keep Britain in the EU face ever-increasing problems, even if he does not even take into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or not?" Corbyn's election to the Labour Party's leadership or the indignation of the Trade Union's Central Organization to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomat recently explained that, since the EU is in such divergent crises, all of which are not its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centered agenda of Britain, which is full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not want to see.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Association of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them if they derailed social protection.
We could call it Dave and George a selfiegenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are delaying summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local memorial either with or without a local eyewise, and then coming home, saying that they will win the supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwardly inside the British EU chart - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - proposes that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we leave.
German Careful and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his actions before it goes to ruin in the same way as he went to the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Holland faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, a Spanish leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of the selfiebrits, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of the separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend proposes, some of these ministers can even consciously plan to make comments in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The new negotiations had been held" and "the new negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have been bold to experience how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how sceptical the EU press is, what they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed by the 2:1 ratio.
They can blurredly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euroopportunist who named himself by writing "EU direct bananas" as a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a booklet of foreign hackers visiting taxes, telephone hackers, and persons whose place of residence is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same way, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a craving gorilla, the bananas have to be given up because of the shock, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blarish than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation, and Bair had granted the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at the Westminster Parliamentary House on Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me), would seem to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's 80s boicot of Murdoch's strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marri, whose BBC-control Corbyn left on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is, in beautiful terms, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people in the United Kingdom's independence party, Ukip's military indignation and the Conservative Party outside the most fervent nationalist, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said this both on radio and on TV this week when his inner patrolman would have wanted to admit that the Corbyn's choice to appoint a Karski John McDonnell as Minister of Finance of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father's father was stabbing on TV trying to be unloyal to his working party's government colleagues without, however, going so far as to lose his place of rule.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But for it, the battle to remain involved in "a situation anywhere" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and in the light of everything that Corby told the chiefs and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the inextricable, emotional and personal image that Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the period of 24-hour TV, and especially in the spinning of social media, which is acceptable to growth platforms for paranoids and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the Labour Party clear in the referendum campaign.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
But the basic tour of McDonnellin and Corbyn in relation to EU membership (and therefore in line with their adjustable Benn economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers whose narcissism of small differences is a key dogma in learning nassis.
With regard to his two-way relationship with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby did not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats simply have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have doubtful voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed in the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Conservative Government is in power, as I was reminded at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticized Public Health England's electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency claims that electric tobacco is 95 % less harmful than traditional ones were born from meeting 12 people, some of whom had links with the tobacco industry.
Experts from British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's public health in England (PHE) criticisms in his report on electric tobacco.
The PHE published this report on the "story" last month, describing it as a "cover of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of information and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published a letter attacking the PHE's main management decision on the "exceptional hutera base".
Two other BMJ scientists have wondered whether the arguments "built on the rock or on the sand."
Professor Martin McKee of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and professor Simon Capewell of University of Liverpool of clinical epidemiology say: "The main principle of national health is that practices should be based on proven efficiency."
They say that the public expects PHE's claim that "the best estimate nowadays is that electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on the detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criterion decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the adverse effects associated with different products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, which is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting reported having received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The panel's selection criteria are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also report that they have received funding from the field.
Others were not known for their expertise under the supervision of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's director of tobacco.
The study produced by the group "greatly admits", that there is a lack of "indisputable evidence in the majority of products and in most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's arguments that "there is no evidence until 11 that electric tobacco works as a route for smoking children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's head of health and well-being, says that the claims made by BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoked their lives die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not appear to be, especially when there is so much public uncertainty in relation to relative dangers.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS 2 billion per year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if electric tobacco is not riskless, its disadvantages are only a fraction of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco - we fill our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "provide anything" for hits such as this soap series on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence fees should be used only for the execution of programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised BBC for putting in programmes of public service that are likely to have a smaller audience in difficult time of broadcasting against the most viewed programmes of competitors and for channels like BBC4.
After BBC's CEO Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he came to Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programmes that would clearly agree to unsubvented competitors," Johnson told the High Room Communication Committee as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and do not do.
The Voice is being sent to the most important missionary period because it is wanted to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the program, it's a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why the retrogressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders the other, without denying the inside of the house.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about public service broadcasting.
I don't think it would weaken BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said that BBC is responsible for the hunting of audience numbers "for the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on BBC's most popular series, reminding the comments of former Sky leader Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to propose that BBC sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public public service programmes "go to BBC4 where the number of viewers is often not measured, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then pay £4 billion in defense of hypocrisy to say that 'it is true that we are doing all these unknown programs that no one sees'".
They're putting them in a missionary place where no one ever comes to look at them.
With regard to the voucher, Johnson said to the Committee: "I will challenge you to look for a more regressive system on who gets the most return from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that a year is 150 pounds worth a lot, but I don't know if that's true for those people who have 150 pounds in big money because they don't use BBC much.
Former Skyn and Channel 5 leader David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its role at the time of Reith "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australia's and Canada's broadcasts and change the role to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
With regard to the partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he said would only show on television, and join commercial companies so that all of them could be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the shutters change direction as soon as the sound drive hits them.
Researchers have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound waves.
Switchboards change the direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses work by connecting genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasound-reacting film channels.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
Researchers said that worms show the operation of a new, named sound genetic method, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Mreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive measure in which people's brains are led to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Swivels do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced the ultrasound waves that then went into the worms.
Consolidated ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are found in some worm cells.
Voice waves make these ionic channels open and activate cells attached to them, as reported in the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled shuttle valves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their operating nerve cells have TRP-4 ionic channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound in modified mats, microcups reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to mats where they connect modified operating nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a uranium tool that allows scientists to connect neurons on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that must be sent through optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhinderedly, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using genetic therapy and therapeutic virus it may be possible to get the target human neurons to react instantly to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising may be a disgrace to the British arms trade
See the video against Amnesty International Arms Fairs.
Horrible killer machines!
Ankle-breaking leg trucks!
Grapefruit bombs!
And electric folding pumps that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
A joyful voice and comic book language leave no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to underline the British government's willingness to trade weapons to oppress governments at the ExCeL Centre at the London yard.
Subject: DSEI Armament Exhibitions: Authoritarian governments arrive in London
With a separate campaign, there were also many posters for bus stops and subway trains, which required more detailed access.
"Important information, will you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together you will be asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrives on the DLR route... and customers are asked to help stop the arms fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Museum of Cruel Designs of Banksy Dismaland.
The Collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. It is a six-litre package of six-lock keys in which the collective says "will reach a third of the entire planet's bus stops advertising space".
Transport for London hasn't enjoyed this unauthorized "publicevandalism."
One of the parodyal ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs and University of Essex's lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists at opposition fronts when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arms poster greets the workers in the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed via Facebook over the last 24 hours over 100 000 times. It created a free advertising agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background reporter worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the weapons fairs were not advertised at all - and also in ExCeL's calendar there was an empty point - and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the thought of a more realistic advertising of a blurred corporation, but "it was more stopable to emphasise it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now, the UK government must take action and ensure that the instruments of torture are not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fairs comes from the inside of ExCeL when the exhibitors trade fantasticly beautiful products.
Saab revealed when he pressed that he had received an order from the U.S. military "at 4CS RS launching from the shoulder".
This includes "a typical pipe fitting arm that focuses on excellent effects in the rear of the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student's apartment
It's been 11 years since, when I was unknowingly 19 years old, I moved to a student's apartment, and then I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the violent smiles of people I irritated and numerous long complaints of others.
Most of my lessons can be summarised in eight simple rules.
To move to the apartment can be anything from nervous to completely frightening.
It's tempting to bump: tell me where you're from, did you have an intermediate year, and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a juicy thing to find me in my room."
Breathe.
And also help others draw their breath... ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find those people you like, not those you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyes were on fire and they shared the extinguishers.
Give people room.
People's rooms often turn into cocktails, movie nights and high entertainment places, but they are also those places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even imagine starting a university while you're in a relationship
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dwellings form from room to room a culture of walking, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I like you and I want to be a friend of yours, but now you have to leave that I can regain the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a student mate is tired of socialization, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
To knock when there's a talk: knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendly through baking.
Because you start the university during the top of the bakery season, knocking people's doors with a chocolate float plate and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less "help to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50.
Offering self-skilled delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your residents experience the obligation to talk, and it may be that they will continue to link your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on how you can bake.
Poorly mixed meal sugar-fats will likely only make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask the dairy owner.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even if they boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my roommate who mixed his milk with a washing material to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You should not be moaning so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that wording pata ringing the roof.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor if they could play drum and bass music quieter because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a test in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume of voice.
When they finally shut down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before she put her own music on the bush, locked her door and went to a three - hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband happened to move to the same apartment with you?
Or inversely, wouldn't it be unbelievable if you considered a partner as your future spouse, you would strike together, you would divorce, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate isn't really your next husband, you could even try to make sense to your bottom.
In that timid moment when you find that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the limit between tricking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
Good trick is fun, but it's possible to cancel in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in the water glass that you put on the freezer, but don't attach their property to the roof with a zinc as much as twice.
Racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - A house designed as a reception centre was damaged in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kite in North Karelia took place at the foreign students' place.
Unlike the police said earlier, this is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have been longer in Finland, says Professor Heidi Luukkainen of the Evankelis People's College.
The windows and walls of the accommodations in the National Hull were pierced with racist signs, such as hacksters, and a metallic object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation, says the East Finnish police.
According to Luke, in the building under evil authority, 10 people were estimated at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luke says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National College.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in a messed-up building have a status.
Some are studying in adult basic schools, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luke tells us.
A status is a permanent residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The East Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, students were held on Monday's news conference, which also included the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had forty years foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luke says.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
As perpetrators, they were suspected of having at least three men, and they had been on a blond passenger car.
I think this is the headline of the youngest weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luke says.
There has also been a bustling hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception centers.
The case happened last week.
It was on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted as a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
It's been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9 at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y train for the Livestock... the passengers in their instincts, "Aivan idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Livestock stops travelling in March.
The news indignated passengers on the Helsinki main railroad station from the beginning of the night of the train.
In particular, the downhill road hits the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident in the municipality.
It's just stupid, because the population is growing all the time and working people need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in HSTV's interview video he'll be coming to the capital by tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains along the main track will be combined with a new R-line.
Purola station in Lakepää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry purchases trains during the next contract period.
The contract period varies over the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntian Bengtström considers that the State train operator is a short-sighted operation.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made earlier and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then the repentance comes on.
The Y train also uses other than the Rasseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and passes by several stations.
On the train, the Espooian Annina Pöyryä was troubled by the fate of those who traveled beyond the city area.
"It's just bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in pain to the Y train.
A little relief is under promise.
There must be a new train connection to the coastline, which replaces the Y-train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which leads to the Churchnumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for local municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs in detail.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, of course much more.
The R-line on the main track leaves two seats out.
Instead, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes are stopped from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are carried out on interruptible shifts, with around nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on Capital's timing book: "Marx should be acquainted with"
World economic crises have raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work, published in 1867-1894, Capital, writes as former president of the SKP, known as Yrjö Hakanen, in the current book Marx's Capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and penetration in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved surprisingly far-reaching.
The book writer's list, based on the Hakasen seminars, is also a professor of the University of Aalto, a prestigious economic participant in Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's timing "old and forever".
But isn't the former director of the Industrial Research Institute and the Delegation of the Industrial Industry Marx?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays social sciences have been differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political aggravator and author of literature.
"The ordinary concept is that the atheist history tells about the wrong opinions of dead men," Corkman begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical installation.
"The most relevant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing the interests of Marx, as well as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a changing world as a result of technical revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thinks capitalism was an undesirable case that should just stop.
Still, he thinks he should be acquainted with Marx.
"In the '70s Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"Matians and Trotskyians and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more one another."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weighting of the past few years.
"Every social scientist should be acquainted with Marx's world of thought - as other classics," says Korkman.
UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for the establishment of a Special Court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka in the Civil War, reports AFP News Office.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as tamilitikes.
The Sri Lankan Civil War is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There's no exact information about the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack on the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as required in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing laterals and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
The Yo-English experiment received social media stitching.
On Wednesday's autumn high school booklets had a long foreign language, most of which had English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their English skills.
In the experiment, he could have written the material on social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article of the 150-250 words in English could show the online magazine to the publisher.
The title was Dear Agony Aunts.
Agony Aunts are in charge of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice as to how parents would be able to look at things for young people as well.
There were four subjects of the total substance, one of which was to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," evaluates the third subject of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school in English Lecturer Mia Lybeck.
On the third subject, there was only a siteau from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth theme, Lybeck said, was really nice.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the entire experiment "unnormal."
In Finland or Sweden, the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts, such as the adaptation of summer kampel to climate change and the handling of large masses of information.
A certain lengthy Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The articles of the autumn will continue on Friday, when there will be another domestic or Swedish or Finnish experiment.
In high schools, the test is normally conducted, that is, the wage earners' mental expression does not affect it.
The College of Students invites the experts to search for appropriate travel connections in time to get to the test.
Even more time can be gained if it can be shown that the lateness was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, they robbed the store with gun threats.
On Wednesday morning, Oulu was robbed of a shop in the district of Kello.
The police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and his face was covered in a comandopipo.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, a man had threatened personnel with a handgun and received a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a rude robbery.
Police reserve tens of thousands of demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The government's opposing mental expression will block the Helsinki center on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive at the site.
Members of the SADC, Akava and STTK associations will meet at Railway at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the manifestation.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alerts and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of gigantic expression.
The roads leading to the railroad are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from the road circle of Kaisaniem, from the direction of the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the work of the police.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming to support parties from other parts of Finland because of the manifestation.
The police won't tell us any exact numbers of patrols.
"Something is coming, but in general we will manage on our own," Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private caring in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic link extends from Hakaniemi level to its nuclear centre.
Striking traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed to the Railway.
The buses will be left a long way away, in principle.
Then you have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
Mental expression also stops Helsinki's mass transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side of this.
The issue of the smoothness of transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with partly by itself.
The organizers of the mood have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of government economic policy opponents.
The police are waiting for the manifestation to go smoothly.
People are either ordinary or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local expressions of mind throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression of mind is, in many ways, exceptional. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of the trade unions organized on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Professor Martti Siisiainen of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't, it would raise the hands up in front of the government, Siisinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition - and also points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hardholdings are not covered by contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have any support from all employees for Friday's manifestations of mind.
The new is now the strong division that the expression of mind will bring about among the ay movement that would want to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from various parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If Friday's manifestation seeks a benchmark, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostortai, held in 1993, says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostortai gathered 20 000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (kesk) government stumbled from a labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois administration.
Now the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than the time of the Murrostorte.
Besides, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still in such an interesting way that it is so tightly right-wing despite fundamental Finnish talks.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the breakthrough.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
Mental expression also stops public transport and possibly closes up day homes and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the greatest for years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're on the fence.
Traditionally, Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
Protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sinisan.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get swine trash on them.
The strike of firemen took three months in 1998.
Exhibitions were also carried out by, among others, pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical stalls of the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the metal strike.
The strike was interrupted on the motion of the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the power strike lasted 49 days and caused power breaks around the country.
Murrostortai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met in the House of Representatives to express their opinions on behalf of the work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the largest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught on chicken eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers sprinkled tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn the playgrounds in front of the meeting.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
A few deaths occurred during the strike during the 1995 strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and the mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass disengagement eventually prompted negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Medicals in strike - forcing," was part of the strike of doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a lively debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical pay.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out that the refugees have been filled with a Finnish truck to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to investigate the situation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck near the German border in Aisterheim, with 42 refugees on board.
There is no information as to whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene of events in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, others in Austria who travelled by a truck were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by drowning.
According to the general radio first reported by the Austrian police on cooperation, the truck belongs to the Finnish company.
The company operates, among other things, in restaurants and its CEO is a foreign-faithed, approximately 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for the transport of human smuggling.
A fugitive captain, an ex-drug driver and a stunning businessman, a story of five smugglers.
Upper king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-looking taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of Trenton University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and these "clients", and their book Death Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present the smugglers of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from the various stairs of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of my mind right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for summer entertainment.
For its location, the islands are also excellently suited for smuggling, since the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives, the captain who burns in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with blue, ten - meter wooden trees for hundreds of times.
If the boat falls full, it'll fit 40 people.
One trip Emir earns around 8 000 euros after the costs.
Emir has five assistants looking for him for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab period, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will lodge them in empty houses for as long as you can see.
Food is given so that customers just and just stay alive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer is running out of money, that's their problem.
They're going to go to the water at midnight with the lights shut down.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and in 20 meters high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the cargo has been landed in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he's stabbing his clients and at least claiming to beat the procurers dead.
He says in the book that when the police once squeezed him, he threw all his passengers over the border and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took customers one by one from the neck and threw them over the coast," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them out of their minds right now.
We have to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Usual taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovað in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter is pulling his last, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving over and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða has a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers to lunch from Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre without their families, the men are housed in tents, plates and abandoned cars, which has now been found or constructed by anyone.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted an application for asylum for a reason or another to Serbia are also living in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings of borders and weekly walks in a hard - traveling land, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
At the end of arriving in the Bogovaða region, at the great juncture of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanians, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he tells you in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," says Gora.
He says the Africans are trying to tink.
Goran doesn't like it.
You fool, you fool, you fool all the way.
First, we agree to a price of EUR 300, then they count it to EUR 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than anyone else and he's just gonna charge 50 euros per person from the Hungarian border.
It's a trip of three hundred miles, most of which are comfortable in the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice year's income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis do not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his riders a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his customers the right direction and humiliate away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers who escape from Congo, and a small center to help Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of kindness.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the rubber strip of white underneath the low waist of jeans will look elegantly.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedeks, his landing car and three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client will start by calling from a five telephone numbers of the Envoy.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money with a whistle and dive into the cross-border merchants.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees to the Ugandan authorities, it must be told that they are from the northern Kivu war areas, for example, and that they have been forced to flee the violence in their home.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Envoy will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate is discarded and another is purchased.
It helps the missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
Then the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum seekers process, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Organization in UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he has also become a refugee to Uganda.
He bills for each staircase separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization about 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice fires
Tom is a starting smuggler, a former drug driver.
An Irish 40-year-old travels on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on his way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who don't even necessarily know they're in a human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across the motorway to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they go through the channel to the British.
Tom picks up the right truck. Make sure he's on his way to England, and he doesn't even go to Holland, and he cuts off the protective hood.
It's gotta be done quietly so you don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will roll his client into a aluminium foil, similar to the one in the kitchen that is wrapped around the fryer or oven potato.
It should stop the police's heat scanner from detecting the hiding place.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the place hoping that he didn't drive sluggish travellers at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The Turkish outcast has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal uprisings of the Mediterranean, dominating maritime routes from Turkey to the EU, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only requires the money to be there.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship deception: Turkish harbors are rented to take US or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are being loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported against payments of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial hats, until these are time to leave.
People are merged into minibuses and driven somewhere to the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get onto the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The marine guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the fewer passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 for one luxury boat trip after the costs.
He does not deal with practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, householders and other smaller players to work for himself.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have purchased land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he's probably gone.

American Olympic Riders Tells About Their Disease and Become Prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
In a book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells us about the end of his career and his career as a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career for the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the races in the top shape and ran in the carnivals for the second best time.
But in the finals, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed into the tip and defended his lead on a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races of suicide, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for sex with foreign men.
He also spoke of his husband's acceptance of his actions.
The favor Hamilton tax was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton's prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had had in his competition in general sports.
Later, favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters in the world's statistical code 3,57.40, but remained at the Sydney Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian skiing flower on the hill: "From the bottom."
Norway's skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Federation have set aside all summer and autumn, like last year's sports agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not applied to the multiplicity of world champions and Olympic winners.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian skiing union decided to shut Northug out of the future season's world cup.
The decision was given thanks by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union had put the skiing flower under control.
"Thank you for showing your back," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Looks like Northug would like to be part of the six-year country team so he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a covenant that will also care for future generations, and that he will not let one of the athletes alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured that he would want to have brave Norwegian colors in the next season in the worldcup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MMs in his career, of which two golds.
He was in Falun last winter on a winning team of messaging gold.
The turtle day of the fryers is also held in the North
On the day of the 25th of September, tricks will be held in different restaurants and shops that have been granted the Turtle Translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food skills and to decay the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the kil as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have been concentrated on the capital region, but that top restaurants that have been audited and classified by an impartial operator are available throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the kilpiratory and the organization.
A restaurant in Vaasa in Fondis and Kantarellis is organized in the north of the country.
In Kokkola there is an old town restaurant for the turtle day.
The event has also received significant attention at international level.
The event has therefore been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland continues to remain host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: A complaint against the Chancellor of Justice concerning the establishment of a reception centre in Kauhava
The Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are cooperating in the establishment of a reception centre for refugees currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy in Kauhava's former shipownership.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure in the period of crisis, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely Finland's Erillisnets Oy, remains permanently in the region.
The Kauhahajoki magazine states that, according to a private person, the establishment of a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Flying School, which have no effect on the preparation of the reception centre as well, the newspaper will write.
The case states that in the area of Kauhava, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the entry of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, inter alia, with the Minister of Defence, Jussi Soisto (P.) and the Head of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The individual submits to the Chancellor that the complaint is not about the fundamental opposition of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned place in the former armament area is wrong.
The City Hall of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
Siege: Syria's situation reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The government means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, Soisimus commented to the journalists at night after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He appreciates the fact that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the solitude, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea.
The sociation is a hopeful development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to affect the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the sorcery, the issue of NATO was also ignored in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.

Early education agency promises to report further changes to activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches will not always be transmitted in the future by the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as a channel, then we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland's economy is to the extent that it requires television and radio talk for citizens.
This set of issues, which are now being discussed, is rather complex and requires longer arguments.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The address will be sent at 21.05-21.20 at both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's TV talk won't tell us about the more general government's inward turn.
Is it an attempt to tighten the right to define public debate in its own hands and to refuse public debate on the settings for questions?
It reminds me of Soin's silent comment that he does not follow the media agenda or let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues will not be interrelated.
Kovunen understands that commercial media has been indignated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The types of communication of political decision-makers are not a matter of communication in democracy.
The role of media representatives is defined to ensure that agendos of politicians are not adopted.
He says TV talk is a big risk for Sipila.
In speaking, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there any more available today than we've already heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, differently or differently, or to say something new?
Kovunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Usually take this risk in that sense if this is not a special situation, but a routine talk among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labelled as a message by politicians or by the delegation and by the government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general line.
Stick's a smart bet
In the future speech of Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
At night you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
Kuutin says the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipili, because this is how this will bring out its own view without sounding.
This will provide a large audience without a journalist's filter, unlike a news event where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes through the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because specific questions are not allowed to be raised.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä shows up on TV... the coin sweats, if the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to the father character who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do well, it can work.
The situation is different than that if the government were to inform one thing, because in this case a person speaks directly to another person.
Obama and the partners regularly engage in such (President Barack of the United States).
Really Exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He says that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organize demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
The president of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, says that Sipilä could hold his speech on the status of the nation in the delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
There's no time for monologues.
Soon, half a year from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old son on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy's been found and in the world, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
It's also confirmed by the Finnish Police Department for the evening.
The boy went out to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later tonight, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all those people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the tens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more closely than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent savage of young people:
The Kurdish freelance artist Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to immigration backgrounds for young people.
Makwan Amirkhani held a pressing speech against young people's reluctances.
At the age of five, Amirkhani, born in Iran with his family in Finland, has so far won both his professional game in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to see a Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani tells me that he is disappointed in the savageness of young people.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 successors on Facebook.
Guys kick on the ground, sit on the other one and slap without thinking about any of these consequences when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people visible in the videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinose of the Helsing Police, the social media has loaded both immigrants and Finnish young people.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You make life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become extremely gruesome.
A little hard, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get subjected to racism, you'll blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that kind of thing, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You're gonna make me hate something that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
The SGF will hold its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, Germany's President Lauri Lyly reports that the Employee Organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present to the government its own proposal to achieve the 5 % productivity factor required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
Mr Akava's president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation in Germany soften its earlier position.
The German President, Lauri Lyly, commented on this briefly on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the Bureau of the SGF will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is seeking solutions to open the labour market block, and it is necessary instead of forced laws to conclude agreements between the active parties.
Mr Lyly reminds us that the proposed social agreement proposed by the Government of Prime Minister Sipilä for the SME did not apply.
Sipilä had previously cut out the negotiations on the social agreement when the SME did not agree to commit itself to the target of 5% of productivity.
Comment: The great protest threatens to blow "I feel like a little funny tree fist"
I wonder if it feels a little funny to pull a fist, if there's already a reconstituting paper in the pocket, it's Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensations vary in the employee camp from one side to another.
Is it meant to call the government to revoke or then agree with it?
On Monday, the German Federal Leaders bled holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The threat spread to the Acavalans.
The OAJ trade union of teachers threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day home will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), President of the STTK Association of the Centre of Staff, appeared as a conciliation.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and had drawn up an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) as a five-percent productivity factor.
Sture Fjäder (cok) of the Akava President immediately rushed to announce that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard in the office of the S.A.I.A.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree with when the federal leaders just Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SME Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SME will seek solutions to open the labour market block.
In order to create a common proposal for employees, the SME should tend to accept a 5 % profitability factor as an objective.
No wonder the STTK of Palola has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of the fire, Mr Jukka Ihanus, head of the STTK's social impact, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhase and Mari Kivinieme.
So the ballole described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Random or not, but the Palola exit took a little clean out of Finland's standers, whose boom picture is the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I wonder if it feels a little funny to pull a fist if there's already a reconstituting paper in the pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Additional information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
President Sergei Naryshkin of the Russian Duma criticized the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes Mongolia is a better host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun a symposium of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshk made extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians from the European Union, such as Naryshkin, at the meeting - a matter on which the President resembled journalists.
According to our assessment, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States where his access had also been prevented.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complex, so Naryshk continued his scoring of Finland by commending and thanking Mongolia for "excessive organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that Parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at the Ulan Bator meeting.
The lock meets the real playoff player: "The battles are tight"
Tappara and Lukko will continue the bully days in Haka forest today when both of them will be on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in the Haka forest, she won't see a real goal party.
Tappara went to the Kuopio yesterday to dig up a 3-2-time win from KalPasta.
The rise was manly, because the silver group in the last season was the worst of the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more mollifying.
As a guest of Blues, the Raumatians' prey, had round zero points, and loss readings were also 2-3 years old.
Hard game, paints in tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-assailant Janne Lahti predicts settings on the club pages.
Tappara has formed a fair playoff nightmare for the Raumatists.
In fact, Tappara has dropped in the two previous periods just from the final series of Luko.
On both sides, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Locker took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, with the exception of goalkeepers.
The cashiers that both rejected yesterday will have a humiliation today.
With the Killara goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View corner: In recent running a terrible play
The sports director, Hopela, handwritten by the chief coach, Rautakallio's inappropriate follow-up, writes from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky film where he himself played the main part.
The contestant sensationally put in campuses a heavy series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky was very sympathetic, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ashes story to Pori.
Anonymous and wooden patrullery pack went forward to the 2006 SM finals as a surprise.
The team was full of rocky-like unnamed, but hard-to-reachers.
There were white Indians, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players turned their heads red and cut off the irokeees.
The wishhouse became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The asses took the won silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Hopela believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager has built a pagan for the evil sons.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have rotted guys in the neck like Rocky pig carcases in the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen's earnings are in some other place than a game.
The hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Railbow Sean Connery.
In Rocky, hopela's handwriting of the iron rock is as clumsy as the main performer of Connery's original work in 1976.
There's nothing in the railroad except Rocky's nickname.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
He appreciates the hard game, but there's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Mr Garret Stafford tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen's head.
He got the judges 2+10 minutes, but the Railbow put him in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the Aceek, and the hot-heated Railbow was blown up after the game to the 100th-year-old nation.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops, mentorers.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the main coach has complained of a shortage of skills.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Iron Kallio responded diplomatically.
It's underneath the surface.
The annual model of 1953 Railways is known to be interested in moving to Hopela as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the majority in the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of the 1-6 goal.
I wish you wouldn't have written the next part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother.
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka when he was a teenager, they wouldn't have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
It kind of feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He's been married to Apulan's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under Tuuka's guidance.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulana You made us a beautiful movie with a drummer Sipe Santapukki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though this father Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of reason.
The more I have known my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Luckily, too, I understand that the drama is dramatic and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulasta would become the largest band in Finland.
The '90s, there was a depression and a real duck.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot about Tuu from his youth before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the very least, he could have hiddenly enchanted himself.
Olga says he's been working so hard with Tuuka for 10 years that the big joint project is not scared.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple who live in Italy often plans to drive home for their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have taken us very warmly, just asking what regrets and when to be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play film
Iron Sky, led by Timo Mountainsola: The Coming Race, is a budget of EUR 17 million.
The descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Mountainsola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's follow-up part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, rises to the most expensive play film in Finland's 17 million euro budget.
Previously, the most precious film in Finland has been titled by Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
After graduation of Iron Sky 2, the Angry Birds animation will also rise, as the film's budget is more than EUR 100 million.
The film produced by Timo Mountainsola and Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Mountainsola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scary.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I have such a relaxed fiilis from the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he'll tell the evening magazine.
Initially, the film had been budgeted for 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million people should be involved in the film, because each image angle and efficiency is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loosening.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass financing campaign and a bond that pays 4-8 per cent of the annual interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' breasts have recently decorated big logos.
Some time ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in the consana.
Advertising the label of a caper or a T-shirt was seen as a junt.
It's time that changes.
Sport has become a real megatrend of fashion, and also old, well-known sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness wave.
And like so often before, the border between funny and trendy is blurred: if something's already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, that is, a tavismoot, where trends were surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothing as a means of separating itself from mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, you'll put on the shirt that's buried at the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the Logs, for example, Adidas' identifiable trackers, the favorite team's game shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the alkaline are now a cool detail.

The Russian politician published the evidence, "I'm not stuck in the tank's bone for hours!"
According to the allegations, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, rapporteur for the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove the large-scale Zotov tank for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture where he seems to look at the trunk of the armor vehicle in a very good mood and at least on the basis of their pictures it is not about getting stuck or mad.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside a battle tank, but it was a raid tank truck BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Komosomolskay Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian military television channel Zotov explained that he had amazed at the exhibition about Russia's new technology because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was amazed at our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the raid tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called on the reporter who wrote about it to be a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and rotten, but nothing that would be stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to the Russian sluzhba novostei radio.
The words of Zotov support the fact that no photograph of the alleged seizure has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people took place during a few days at the exhibition.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a story on the Bloknot.ru website where Zotov was told of his ripping of the tank box while trying and finally threatened to shoot everyone around unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the organizers of the exhibition reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, because of his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way did he sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's the favorite item for decorative bloggars.
Architects' brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candle from 1962 looks like it was planned today.
The hot steel frame is like a piece of art, and that's what it originally was.
Architects' brothers are known to have worked out the shape of a candle long and mathematically accurately.
It was presented at first only to the honored dinner guests of the lords.
The Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the legacy of the famous brothers.

You're testing someone's endurance.
He's no paper, but you know he's not hard like a rock.
You're the same in a number of things, like life power.
You're wondering how things are going forward.
You have strength and will to make them succeed.
It is also important to be mild toward yourself and others.
But you're not so fast that you could get someone to understand your position about it.
He's slow, and he doesn't even want to be in charge with you.
You're on your feet with someone, because there's one thing going on.
There is no one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
But you're not racing in a traditional sense, but you want to know what kind of a man or woman he really is.
Your assumption hits the right one.
That's why it's good to brag his chest.
You've got a chance today to have something to do with.
Do it even if your time is on a card.
One of them is a person of his own kind.
You'll understand it by the time he opens his mouth.
The gestures and expressions also tell a lot of time before that.
Someone's going to get in front of you.
You can't see that the situation would be amazing, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're going.
Your experience is right, even though someone wants to show that he's much more aware of things than you.
The need for emphasis is not the only thing that's going on in him.
Your readiness for different tasks has increased over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's a little bit of your self-esteem.
You're gonna be wondering if there's anything to do with it.
You're at the edge of the essentials.
You know a lot about where you move and who you want to spend your time with.
You won't stay in your seat. You want to move forward.
You're stressing a certain kind of thing about yourself so much that someone starts talking to you about it.
The debate is not about to end.
It shows how interesting you are.
There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called sand pool to the dive.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
There is neutralised sand of the foaming process and cleaned process water.
Usually, water is pumped for re-use as a process water or carried through the surface valuation field to the environment, according to authorisation.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The other ingredients were not poured into the environment.
The leak was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No bleeding has been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the pond.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred stable workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: The IMF warns not to cut too much
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation paved on structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime allowances and paid leave days would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in the area of unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppamäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment has a lot of sympathetic message for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be too much cut.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to economics.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
For this year, the IMF anticipates a 0.4 % economic growth rate for Finland, which will increase to 0.9 % next year.
Today, Danske anticipates that growth will remain on zero this year in its new cyclical forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They could have had the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in small growth during the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention could have been paid to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer measurements.
However, there are only a few per cent of decimals in the gaps.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, died of cancer, began his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendoa since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the success of the Wii consol.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluated by the Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being heavily involved in mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, there are hundreds of minor applicants on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
Overinspector of the Immigration Agency Juha Kannelmaa tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will disappear "under" a year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
They're missing nine.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11, Cannelmaa reports.
The background to the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be a full age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were taken a demolition decision because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is the amount growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a minor who came alone.
The total number of minors who have disappeared this year is not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well, he stresses.
What happens to those who have taken the decision to turn?
Are they also missing, for example, in the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the implementation of the translation decisions is the responsibility of the police, the Cannelmaa stresses.
Mr Petteri Orpo (Cok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants in the country.
He's taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed the issues of refugees at the EU Inter-Ministry Meeting, discussed practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of equipment
Because of the disease scenes, the equipment used by Timo T.A., who lost his ability to work in the media sector, is now being sold.
Mikkosen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which in the past were the most advanced tools for professionals.
The online announcement was the first online magazine to tell you about the Nightmakasine.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left on the foot of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that way, but these are also needed as long as there is material from the old generation that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current stormhouse.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've started to invent and see what stuff they give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There's no use for TV or radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the aftermath of the infarctions in the brain that a long career man no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's actual work of life was already archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited to pick up films and other materials from the storm shop.
Transport threatens to lumber worse than expected: Metro and railroads can stop all Friday
Metro and railroad drivers will decide today whether they're expanding force on Friday's manifestation.
The original plan was to stand in metro and rail traffic only for the time of the manifestation of the mind on Friday.
During the afternoon, we'll figure out if the traffic stops for the whole day.
Chief trustman Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is huge on the field.
Night and rotary cuts squeeze the drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the litters raise resistance.
He wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tramways stand by Friday, public transport is virtually completely stopped in the capital region.
According to VR, trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
Friday, they don't move near or far.
The trains that left before morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left on the stall.
The ACP members are out of work from Friday morning to Saturday morning at 3:00 a.m.
Possibly a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the superior force, HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell exactly which bus site thugs will be going on Friday.
Employee organisations will organize a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports AP News Office.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break across the border.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought the own watch was a bomb.
In the United States, in Texas, a 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher kept his own watch in school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronics performance.
But one of the teachers kept the clock like a bomb.
The police were invited to attend, and the situation finally ended when the boy was taken in handcuffs to the juvenile's arrest cell.
Mohamed has at any point been found to have claimed nothing but that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible for the boy to be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the clock looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit record and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday and Mohamedia was punished on three days' forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether the case is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK kohisee - Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the press in the right has also been accompanied by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought labour representative Kate Green in BBC's radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday, the battle of British Air Force pilots against German Luftwaffe was respected in 1940.
In its official opinion, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, stressed in the opinion.
Corbyn's election to be party leader has divided the labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, the cessation of savings and the increase of public expenditure.
Today, Corbyn is due for the first time in the capacity of the party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron spent the week on Twitter, choosing Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a legal case.
The South Lake Minnetonka police have soon investigated the family murder of Minnesota in Greenwood.
A five - spirit family was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a gun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the family of Short dead across the vast house.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Sitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Minnetonka, is still under way.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been making 50 bids for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell a company, but not yet.
The success was shown, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the family of Shorti bought the house in Greenwood for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Jurisdiction on the verge
But StarTribune said the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-trial courses, had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Shorti's website had not been removed from the pre-trial courses, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Water Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the three owners were rewarded at the food event at the Finnish Hippos Month Horse Owner Prize.
This is great, Loiri commented as a good feeling of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned its winning EUR 100 000.
The artist's legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Successful Horse Coach Korpi will get Loir in full peace of work with a horse.
Pekka commands and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
A marvelous gesture from the NHL star: "The greatest gift made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to Montreal children's hospital.
According to the health report, this is the largest donation made by a sportsman of all ages to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in other financial collections for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
So Subban's donation sum is significantly greater than his $9 million annual earnings.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, the long-lived Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars from the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu collected a huge sum of money for another city's major hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.

Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, which Intel publishes.
The board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 % of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and distributing network-based data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Fordin Focus RS model has been expected for years to rise like a moon.
Finally, the car is also in view of Finland.
Ford published RS information now that the car world looks at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
The Ford's new four-lived RS is accelerating, thanks to its 2.3 litre, 350-powered engine, in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially said to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when you report.
The favourite brand Kia presented at the Frankfurt car exhibition two new ones - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, two of the new ones are certainly more important than the new Fourth Generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing street tourism market.
The new European designer, Gregory Guillaumen, created by his fashion Sportage, is more round than ever.
The axle intervals and the outer dimensions have come another centimeter here and the car breaks the air more efficiently.
The engine range is in its main characteristics as well, but it has been added to 177 horse power-developing turbo 1.6 litre.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales revenue.
It will have to be waited a little longer, because we will have a new Sportage coming in in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Starting with 1,7 litre turbodiesel and 2,0 litre petrol engine Optimums.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
In the same time with that income, Optima Farmer's sale begins.
Chisu came back to the stages. He blew up in a bold snare.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life for a child concert with other domestic stars.
An electric blue trouser suit has to be displayed with an open neck hole.
The dress is beautifully presented by the singer star's waist.
The whole crown of golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer has been beaten by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be a year soon.
The singer published his first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything you do about music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will publish his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new state of life has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is astonishing again. Now there's a chest.
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving talks one after another.
He presents his pregnancy and breast-feeding gently in sexy clothes last night at one American time when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband from Kanye West's club.
Black motherhood dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin colored bras underneath the flashlights.
The last time Kardashian was dressed in an amazing motherhood costume when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The apartment was highlighted by the black super-pollution boots.
The third special mother-in-law is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was on her pregnancy.
Model World Hard Laws: No Home, You're Lonely, The Competition Is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (speaking dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths clean about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the previous season you would have popped in top designers' costumes, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces who compete for work with the crows.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where the fashionable houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young, and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are all more stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinny thing.
Agent New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are all the time together, working as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is filthy.
The models want to this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but it is the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just the presentation of clothes.
The models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
You were at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently celebrating fashion scenes where designers will reveal their modelling next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unfamiliar Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band's film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
The board was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the group in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to see the real Antti before the shots, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly for people from that group to the unknown, so I think it's really good that I'm just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make a man's imitation.
It's not like Roope Salminen and the Dogs' group, a man who's not going to play a role.
The Punk Manners come with the man from nature.
Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people in the punk season saw a preview, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been a small soul, but we always go full.
You made us the main performers of the beautiful film that played the bass in Auula in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temose led by Tuukka Basso today.
The band's nuclear forces are still presenting to the large audience a rather unknown young actor.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo basisti Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave advice about his future butt yesterday night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published in Instagram yesterday a picture of his new look that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the soup and the jaw, has shaved his face into a moustache, and blurred his brown hair into black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been forced in recent days to consider how to tell the child the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or should I tell you anything about it?
There is no need to be a force on this, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, member of the SPR crisis group, advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay around in mind and trouble," he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to have a discussion at the beginning of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones older people think he's afraid.
You don't want to scare the child in vain, even if you're angering yourself and scaring yourself.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also experience being safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents are good to talk to them if you think about a child.
The fact is, everyone in the world is not doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how our family is to deal with this.

Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties ahead of life.
This could be of benefit to him in the future.

Difficult control of the Pallosalamaa attacking Vermoon
Pertusa North had the Apila Pallosalama washed off in the middle of the summer.
It only shook profits and two-stops until at the end of July, the Tampere ravens collapsed.
Since Ori was completely blurred, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the extinguishment survived in the search.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease wasn't from the mild end, but it took two doctors to choke it.
Since Apila's ballroom had to be in a light exercise, the North says he was positively surprised at the last run of the horse.
It was in Turku's récord after the second S.E.U.U. after the S.E.U.
Apila's Pallosalama was very pressurized when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The small inclination of those things at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a sledge.
The horse's path certainly went forward, and I hope it would also have stabilized.
Apila's ballroom has been so-called humour horses.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have been thrown into fat without any sickness.
On a good day, however, a lightning chip has been removed from the squirrels that the opponents have been marvelous.
At the speed of the racers, even warm-blooded riders can't make it to the ballroom.
In Vermo, there's a peas race in the north.
However, the different issue is how Apila's Ballroom will agree.
It's kind of hard to get out of here, and it might just be slamming under the truck's booth and stuff.
I hope the squirrel would be calmer already than when Turku left.
The Pallosalama of Apila can also come from the bow when it's okay, and we're going to drive with it, the coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of futile iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones with future programs may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company's CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed at the interview.
Apple's iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime phones, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tinks come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a mandatory update on iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says eliminating Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work firmly with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste the memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, the euro area consumer prices rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
Price rises were brought down to cheaper energy.
Eurostat thus revised the forecast of 0.2 % slightly down from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate of baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than it was a year ago.
The average inflation in the EU of 28 countries as a whole was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The euro countries, or 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, increased most in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still very far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
On average, the ECB forecasts a 0.1 % inflation for this year in the euro area.
Next year's rise will rise to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates its publication in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is next trying to blackmail monetary policy
The next US mortgage begins at its fastest in less than a year, but most certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed starts again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And on the financial markets, the downhill starts before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested starting interest rates this week and not later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next leak can be pressed on by the fastest by next autumn and as the financial market's exchange rate before that.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economic and financial markets operate as they used to - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank in its long-term market and economic cycle investigations by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The Bank distributed more than 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the research and report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine what key economic and financial variables are now in the same or in another model as at previous interest rates - and what will possibly be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to endure the rise in interest rates than they were before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
Fed's monetary policy and its decision-makers have been all along last summer and early autumn suggesting that the time begins to grow.
The first interest rate increase for more than nine years can come this week.
It will be decided within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds control interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a relatively regular but at the same time a series of small 0.25 percentage points of interest rates ended for just two years, with Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing of the United States, and a year later the financial crisis collapsed into a global nightmare of the day of judgment.
The major recession took place in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic downturns began slower than the previous Fed interest rates have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and falls in the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and always since the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts have been reported since the 1950s.
The first interest rate rate has been lower than one year, mostly less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
The Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering interest rate after the early 1950s by a dozen different cycles.
Each time it has differed from some of the others, and it is relatively scarce in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
Strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
The crucial reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be undeniably cleared by even decades of research.
But for three reasons which led to the crisis and caused its destructive power, it seems to be somewhat undeniably clear:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other world's largest central banks held their steering interest rates too long.
They placed the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already too large debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased the central banks' surplus from the impact of monetary policy.
The largest bubble of debt in the economic history so far was born.
3) In particular, the craziness of debt financing in the financial economy, which was almost impregnated, swept up the largest exchange bubbles in most financial market segments until then from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Nor does it make it very hard to argue that the financial markets that have risen to heights with increasingly complicated debt tips were rarely dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove interest up.
The financial structures in place for debt bonds could not last until their time after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had increased.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major decline.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what's going to happen next, but they give an insight into the subject by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Indebtedness has not been crazy for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is cheaper literally than it is free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now in the various parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former league and cheaper central banks has largely remained on the financial markets and has reduced the key types of securities and assets to their most expensive peaks since the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only with the warning signals of the financial markets, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the hardest decline in decades to the model that it has ever been.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but in the same way the pressure and risks of the financial markets are unreasonably greater than before the financial crisis, when the next Fed begins to tighten its money.
Perhaps the image of the future of the French bank of Societe General's strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as the sudden can affect.
For a good time, he has trained the bank's international investor customers in the following full translations of Fed:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles explode, and soon, it's time for Fed to run off the financial fires with even bigger QE cash chips.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturer of computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are against HP's business service side, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focusing on business sales, and the HP Inc., a company focusing on SMEs and printers.
HP's staff were the largest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000-30,000 employees.
The reductions in the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its business outcome.
Another year, its three most important customers brought 65% of the business output.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems with this installation after a "Software Update failed" error statement has appeared on the screen.
To pass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the end process.
This may include deleting applications to get the space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes deleting applications and then reset them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or near the loader during the update that the battery does not stop.
If the loading level is too low, Apple won't let the update go forward, because if the battery stops between, it can lead to a breakdown of the update.

It is also worth ensuring that you have gone through our list of all the things that need to be done before downloading, so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with it new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
General: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax paradise company
The Minister for Transport and Communication Anne Berner (center) has, according to Yle, served as a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
I'm proud of the company's activities related to so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, which was appointed member of the Board of Directors Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg business register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says he left a notice of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave a divorce statement.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in Karelia-Upofloor's Government in 2010-2013 and after merger in Kährs' Government and in the Luxembourg company.
I'm proud of the fact that Kährs' ownership is going through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership in the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner at the request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been part of the Karelia-Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I experienced that my own task was to ensure that the Finnish family company's capital interests were realized.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital gains are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the ownership of Hartwall Capital is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure created in tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had the capital fund Triton already had the Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Espoon Otaniem, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from tonight.
A maximum of 300 to 400 people may increase within a week.
The Immigration Agency shall establish a reception centre for the property of the former Rescue College.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is the sector of the provision of health care and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agreed, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares alternative work life extortion package
STTK undertakes to prepare an alternative package for government labour blackmails.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' central organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's expression of mind.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization's government meeting at a break to journalists.
Palola believes that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the government's competitiveness package pays the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the other side of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible zeal to have a debate on the part of a one-sided relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to make its own package a communication to the Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take the view that the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a debate with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, operation of Sundays is particularly painful in the STTK field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraw from mandatory legislation in order to carry out some of the blackmails.
According to the STTK, Palola does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP that has presented it.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first day's sickness wages are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the Central Organisations have invited employees to manifest their minds and that they have not intended to take place a strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you.
Mr Akava's President, Mr Fjäder, thanks the STTK's report on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has already developed an alternative model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Akava's President, Mr Fjäder, hopes that Lauri Lyly, led by the SK, will come along to prepare a proposal for an option for surgery.
Ms Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Mr Akava informed that he has long prepared his own proposal to negotiate a five-percent competitive leap for the country's government as an option for cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to see the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SADC, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talkoot" - plays bingo when Sipilä talks tonight
Tampere University's Green Left
Tampere University's green left Viva bingo coupon for the night.
The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
The previous request for a similar Prime Minister must be made until 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made a number of radio talks during the winter and continuum war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train drivers' strike on television.
Solitary call, monarchic cunning
Sipilä's speech has raised criticism and guessing all day long about what's to come.
The president of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, said that "Sipilä could hold his speech on the status of the nation in the delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, Ville Soysto, "single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Judgments on Facebook condemned that "monarchicism: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it."
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A few six months from the elections.
There's nothing more to be done by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What's @juhasi pila afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SGC, it was commented directly by the SGC President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Most people have been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered it and stated that it is a public service task to promote the full publicity throughout Finland, a line for the Director of Yle's publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
♪ Like us at the time of the Tammelo ♪
The speech has also been aroused by decay.
Evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be peeled and dressed at their best.
Mom puts on the most beautiful bell and Dad puts the tie in his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., the TV is quieted as before in the time of Me Tammeloi," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also speaking about the fact that in the Finnish government millions of people who hide their capitals in tax paradise are sitting in the capitals of the Finnish government who draw up pardon laws for their fellow tax evaders while claiming to the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is to present the University of Tampere's green left Viva.
It's been posted on Facebook by a bingo.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, living in debts, and the spirit of a team tonight?
Coupons and pencils ready, at 9:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Attaché Island in Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to remove Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, reports to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan for Al-Assad to have stylishly escaped power some time later.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him in a bilateral debate three plans: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and Al-Assad's withdrawal of power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all matters, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said, "Sit Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari remembers at the Guardian interview.
Diplomats do not comment
The Ahtisaari reports that it transmitted the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic did not confirm the content of the debate in the press, but according to the Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time Al-Assad forces had already committed several mass murders and that key opposition groups had refused all agreements in which they would have remained in power.
The former Director of the Department of the Middle East of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sir John Jenkins, has doubts about the talks of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's delegation.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin the same thing so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to hold power on some al-Assad supporter.
Refuge flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Centre for asylum seekers with tyrky in Tornio
The settlement centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building of the Tornion coalition.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place for better control of the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsing said on Tuesday that the Council had already decided to present the school building as a single solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice-President of the Town Council of Tornion, this is not true.
When the whole council was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 representatives of 43 at the meeting.
The organisational centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On the basis of that, you could expect a decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to city leader Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be eligible for the joint agreement.
The expert has visited to verify that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants a job market option for tightening
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), half of the public holiday money would only cover part of the calculation of the cost of work sought by the government.
However, the government would like to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations were able to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
Nor did he know how seriously organizations are looking for alternatives to the blackmails announced by the government.
If such an agreement is to be concluded, we will certainly welcome it as part of the package.
Halfing the holiday money would be a way to work because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery of Sundays by the government.
The labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holidays because they have been registered in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will present these views to the Parliament next week on Wednesday as a communication from the Council of State on the extortion of working life.
Mr Sipilä said that the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
It's not the final back line either.
The legislative work then moves, which means that the train is on the move and is becoming more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long in such matters if there is will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published last week by the government includes, inter alia, the conversion of the endowment and the helatorta to unpaid days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the first day's sickness wages are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being carried out as a compelling legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
The work of the Employee Centres will result in a major demonstration on Friday, and many trade unions have also declared political strikes.
The Tohma Lake Council approved the extension of the Mahlahalli storage
The Tohma Lake Council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy's government, or the Mahlahalli's warehouse.
The criticism caused the project to be bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
The busy timetable was also tireless.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of the stock at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided in the context of the interim report.
The next item was the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) justified.
Even for Karelia's language in Joensuu
The city's government mild its earlier strong position to bring the street towns of Karelia into the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the promotion of the livestock tradition in the whole province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the karelian language is a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern Savorian fractures.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street-name towns in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready for use in the livestock language, for example, in information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city for all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, the use of Karelia should also be cautious now that multiculturalism lives and changes vigorously in North Karelia.
Karelia's language is still the special features of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used for the benefit of the multinational marketing of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the viability of the province
Train connection cuts hit the viability of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business and competitiveness.
And that's the effect that if we can live and work here at all, Joensuu City Director Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also continued on several occasions in his report.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not succeed in reducing our chances with State measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the closures of these transport links on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research board, which is very moving and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that the marketing of the university to Western Finland is already difficult because of the short-term connections.
Approximately half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent of them are from Newland, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my rings for the war of Siu.
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the provincial Siu War project is apparently unanimous, but one of my soraois is one.
The city government member Pentti Mediasalo (sd., in the picture) presented the total abandonment of the project at the government meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unsustainable.
The Board of Directors adopted a draft decision by Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train transport from Kouvola to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though it is less than one train cabiner.
There will be changes in passenger train transport between Kouvola and Kouvola next March.
One train couple will be gone, but five times a day will still get out of Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, EUR 12.3 million will be reduced for the purchase of trains by the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
The VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped out of the place.
The rescue plant let the 12-year-old climbing up the roof, who couldn't get off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at the Tornion hill on the Ketoway at six and a half on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent the boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of the radiologists next to it.
The other boys got the same way down, but one didn't.
The result was that the rest of the people slipped out of the place and the passengers alerted the rescue facility to help with the bettings to the last roof safely back to the earth.
FedEx's two-way operating profit, lowering the fiscal year 2016's prospects
FedEx reports depressing results from its last quarter, and the delivery was cut by its entire year's performance forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end the tax year for $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analytics waited for $10.84, tell them in the FactSet questionnaire.
Despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that began in November in the transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expects business gain to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, increased turnover and increased network trade.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that "the company will work stablely, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for wages during the holiday were published on the day after the competitor UPS told us that he intends to hire 90 to 95 000 extra workers, about the same as he did last year.
In the 31st quarter of August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which remains of the average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analyst survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' questionnaire, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport, which has stopped its Express unit's turnover.
However, the increase in network trade has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29%, but in principle the revenues of the operations were the same due to the costly costs of larger packages and their own insurance.
Express's income was better due to higher basic charges, while operating profits in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed the 11 per cent fall for this year and 17 per cent less than the record for 11 June.
The decision makers of the United States Central Bank will sit this week two days around the huge gastronomy table at the long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the steering rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the central bank's decorative, the two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, should set the financial interests of the nation before anything else.
Congress has lowered the central bank's responsibility for two: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after a great break, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the information shows a steady growth in the economy, recent downturns in the global financial markets may have made the central bank officials that are already on their way to the point of increasing instability, fearing how the federal rate of funds would be affected if the reference value were raised at least in the quarter of the percentage unit.
"Comprehensiblely, labour market and inflation are the first and most important points to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a meklariliike Stifel Nicolaus & Co's main economic expert.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the level of interest to be left unchanged, the increased uncertainty on the world market is a sufficient valid reason to wait," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached in agreement, which already creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the rise, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision makers succeed in softening the impact by promising that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, the main economic expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest right now," he says.
If the decision makers raise interest, "they have to make a lot of effort to support the financial market so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm down the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate by quarter in this month, thus making the first small step towards slow tightening of the monetary economy, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their choices.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of cheering.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers say that this will have a significant temporary impact on the price of dehydrated oil.
The economy "sees higher interest levels and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, the main economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalidated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped by up to 16 per cent of its May record when investors feared that the slowing economy in China would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the central bank's decision-makers, market meltdown is an additional factor in a complex equation, which explains why interest rates should be increased.
"Without these developments in the financial markets and recent weeks of news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Specialist and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information on the consequences of the events in China," Olier says.
International economic well-being is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, the suggestion of the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank could "redeem" the increase in the amount of money, caused changes in the markets around the world.
In a world where the markets and economies are still growing, NCB officials are expected not only to make the following developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted its financial market operations which have appeared to be separate from the basic economic factors."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for interest increases, and Lacker, a qualified member of the Committee, calls for example in the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without prejudice to its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank repealed these cuts.
The Central Bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate assessment committee.
The latest millage is not close to its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to face a situation where interest rates are raised because the market is damaged," says Mr Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains two requirements and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown.
This trade/storage was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a thait shop that also sells to private customers.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
Trade/storage is a one-stop shop that offers a dizzy range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture and religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department in the store if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to go around all the corridors.
If the trade makes you hungry, you can eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The grocery hub inside the shop (good, cheap) is close to the bags, and there are several options for food pickup.
What's in the warehouse, do you need anything... anything... Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
The products are priced reasonably and a large part of the products are sold in wholesale packaging.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thaiyrts, fruits and other products.
The meat tit is large, the same as the fish tit. The staff behind the dish cleans and filed the fish and, if necessary, when you want to bake it for you.
A large part of the movement is reserved for a huge freezer department, where you can find frozen curry leaves, haircuts and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef and sap, pork, fish bottles, local sausages, pasta and other things.

Although there may be a busy shop, the parking lot is usually easy to find.
Brazilian Children's Disease Organization in Rio Grande Advertising Healthy Diet for Lactators
The Brazilian Child Disease Agency SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies in breasts that have been painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by the Texas University of Medicine, Robert Waterland, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies' genetic expression and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in viewers' numbers, despite the Nine Channel's attempts to news the Leader's Discovery in the Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's raid on Canberra to news the post-reveals of the Liberal Party's leadership failed to increase today's audience numbers.
The nine-channel morning program was sent from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull cut off Tony Abbott.
The competing Sunrise program, drawn up by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long international broadcast series covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The median load did not seem to affect Australian television viewers, as Sunrise's average viewer was 397 000 in five state capitals, with today's figure of 339 000.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunris has an average of 349 000 viewers, while Today has an average of 314 000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The winds are blowing this morning away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published TODAY Monday 14 September 2015
The big news of the Seven Channel was the 800-word series, which featured the former Star of the Packed to the Rafters series Erik Thomson, astonishing priority.
A new series of dramas, which collected an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recent widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered if the popular Thomson series is the power to carry alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this one real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factor was a strong favourite for 1.136 million viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Family series (726 000).
Seven channels had two fates on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new visa programme collected an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough for a small profit from the Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour was dizzy 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night average viewer will bring confidence to Nine channels that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce McGuire's programme's audience numbers.

The final triangle agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept in extreme secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
Three remaining girls really don't slip up who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three became two, they could unintentionally give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were cast into poetry when telling how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?", their answers could provide a revelation of who won the son-in-law's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really in the country, with him it's fun to be," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be nice and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with my whole heart involved in this," he said.
When you asked who Wood should choose if not for him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know how to say," he said.
I like the remaining girls the same way, so it's a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.
I originally published with the name "Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayne has many options to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his change to the United States, and many other teams have questioned him as he was impressed by his open day of practice at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers band and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne's exchange bench for the end of the game after this Australian rugby League converter dropped the ball in his first flight shot return when the team was defeated on Tuesday by reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next flight shot and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's real character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Rather than haunting his new entrants as a pothole in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-game press conference.
49ers Special Journalist Cam Inman reports that Haynea also encouraged the coordinator of the special teams Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flight shot that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for for a man's NFL debyyt.
Hayne was seen cursed on the way out of the field after the fall, and later told the Australian radio pairing band Hamish & Andy with a 2DayFM channel 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things now, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her acidification to her Origin debyyt in 2007, when the input in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne owned the Australian flag in a photo published in his Instagram account with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the risk of a Siberian highway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when police shot goms against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shot at the crowd, who showed their minds against the new constitutional proposal of the country, the authority reported on Wednesday.
On Tuesday night, violence took place in the Rupandeh region, about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resorting to rubber.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks, in violent demonstrations across Nepal's southern stalls, members of the ethnic group called Madhesi, the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own country.
After 10 August, at least 40 people, 11 of whom have been policemen, have died in violent rallies.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the provisions of the Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter was able to adopt by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Centre NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of swivel storm.
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported that the wide low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde Island Group, has a 60% chance of becoming a tropical storm.
The second border of low pressure, located in the middle of the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of becoming a tropical storm over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google launches a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who came to Europe fleeing from warbreaks and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a report, the director wrote from his own personal experience, a Google worker, Rita Masoud, who fled with his family at the age of seven from Kabul.
"We traveled through numerous dark train and bus trips, and hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations will receive four non-profit organisations to help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it will respond with the same amount to the donation made on the google.com/refugeerelief website up to $5.5 million, so that the total target is $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been going on since World War II, and it has been mainly the cause of a civil war in Syria for four years, which has led more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Hypotension surgery can help you with mildly overweight diabetes
According to the new study, the benefits of the hypertension surgery of type 2 diabetes may take at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics are living after a weight loss surgery longer than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get data on death," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss specialist who wrote a letter to the new research in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal bag in the cut-off or bariatric surgery.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been sickly fat and their weight index (IMB) has been 35 or more.
The BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered to be normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be overweight.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Thai Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal surgery and reduction of gastrointestinal tract, to treatments of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut-offs fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, people treated by means other than surgery remained mostly the same in 29.
In 36% of the people who were cut, diabetes improved altogether and 28% partially.
For the sake of comparison, in a drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholestery "were generally better in the surgery group," the writers said.
Studies also monitored haemoglobin A1c levels in patients, reflecting long-term blood sugar levels.
The haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the haemoglobin A1c level fell from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glycemic control" described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, however, did not reduce mortality over five years, reports Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
In five years when compared to the gastrointestinal reduction group, the gastrointestinal transfusion group had decreased more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered its weight index (7.4 and 5.1), lowered its haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and was more likely to achieve a complete diabetes remission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer life in more heavy people.
In the Swedish study, it was found that overfats were 29% less likely to die during a 15-year period compared to a group that had experienced more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging, however, for people with BMIs below 35 and interested in surgery.
"Research results are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group," he says, and there is no risk of increased death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time of patients' BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Everybody cannot come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees in addition to the fact that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhism has demanded the cessation of violence in the homelands of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the current refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his ten-day British visit to the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford. The Centre is dedicated to ethics research.
Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual nations or even sub-terrestrials.
He also stressed that while the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also inadequate.
"Everyone cannot come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the action taken by Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"It is amazing to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
In raising the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks and argued that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of rampant events.
"After the 9/11 strike, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, swallowing of a child's hand desinfectant has increased to fourfold
Intoxication centres across the United States have reported a sharp increase of almost 400 % in the swallowing of an alcoholic hand desinfectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports the Georgian poisoning centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the cases of swallowing of the disinfectant reported to the poisoning centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are in the emergency police," López told CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap uprising.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic water to obtain a stronger drink.
The scents of the mental disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting ones (käsises) are those to which the smell has been added.
There are strawberry, grapes and orange disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain alcohol between 45 and 95 %.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated in alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of the University of Kansas Medical Intoxication Centre, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey shot on the table, but the hand desinfectant is left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who a while ago swallowed only four injections of strawberry desinfectant at school, and was taken to the first aid.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult drivers' drunkenness, tells the first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who took care of the girl outside Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
When Nhaijah was speaking, he couldn't walk when he arrived in the hospital.
The doctors followed him overnight at a separate children's hospital in case of possible brain injury symptoms, because alcohol caused the girl to fall and beat her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortor Scott told CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfection towels and remove the disinfection from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol intakes, some disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two ontarioan women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities presume that the product contained methanol, the deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol that was reported to be an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three four-class people planned to poison their "great" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant and denied it from his classroom.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "stricken talk" and leave disciplinary measures in the school district.
Rumorylly: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths detracts from speeches about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Union for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is being warned about the January recruits who can interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow win from Hamilton at Pittodri's stadium and gave the team the opportunity to raise the difference between Celtic and five points.
Griffiths tries to minimize talks about conflict.
Celtic's internal contradictions have resulted in rumors, but Griffiths passed them right away. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under a more accurate lookout when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet you.
The shortage of the Scottish championship race bore the Dutch De Boer
Former Rangers' middle-field player and former Dutch team rider Ronald de Boer has said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current Ambassador de Boer said, "The Dutch is no longer showing the highlights of Celtic's games, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and also other than the Scottish want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Masters League quickly followed the loss to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series at five points apart from the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton's warning of January's player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the potential targets of January's player transfers, he is cautious of the most recruiting, reassuring that he does not want to mix the team's consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in summer, there is a time ahead of the entire adjustment time, which is shown in our team this season.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes the addition of unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name has been attached to Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swans is over.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankle problems, and during the summer he did not succeed in finding a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Union for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was in the last eight months already the third condemnation of Column's red card that was revoked.
Neilson remains behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reproached after singing an insulting song about the former Hearts player from Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at the pub in Edinburgh, Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby in the Tynecastle stadium in March 2014.
"The question was Derby and it was a moment's drive," the attacker added, "It must be safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in Dundee United leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy for the ugly win in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but succeeded in Adam Rooney's first half penalty kicking to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, which lifted them to five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a pockal or a league that would not also have won games like this."
Unemployment of the Scottish people remains the same as the UK's total growth
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained in 164,000 persons between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Britain rose by 10 000 persons to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, according to the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 persons over a period of three months, and the number of people working is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of government is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Britain.
During these 12 months the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I testify to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I will see the execution of the man later today.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit on the viewers' magazine in Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He's asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
In January I received the request through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to scare this day when I'm approaching it.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are chosen through a terrific value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to 12.
Whoever you choose, sees the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own contact with him through calls over the months and through a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pencil with me to save what I've seen.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A Oklah journalist on Twitter accused me of being neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "it could have set his word better," but he still feels that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help a tendency against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After Barry Van Treese's murder, his actions would make him guilty of aid anyway.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure I don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the point of view that I see her dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
You'll get me a description of what it feels like to look like when the man I like dies innecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police chase.
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he pulled a man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his positions went wrong when he found himself in a low, mud water just a few feet away from a policeman who tried to "attract him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale's police were invited on Tuesday to Beckenham for unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come and get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactics: "good police talk."
"Sometimes people do funny things in trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is an insightful example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to start a playful Ben Cousins biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims the journalists tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's journalists tried to override his stability in his garages last year, and threaten to stop competing immediately.
He blames journalists and Racing Victoria's bribery division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatain's late rejection because of the day of the race was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He's kept his tongue under control with respect to spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything goes out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk my head up, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don't have to go on coaching anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb at the racing.com site in an interview where he told me that the bribery department had tried to spy on his house.
"After a year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man, and I named him when I asked him, and they offered him a job on my deposits, if he gave me information about what I'm doing there.
Clearly, they think I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, they really should fire their lawyer because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a mentor and perhaps to transfer responsibility to others other than coaches for what is going on in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that things I'm saying now might not make them think about that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it hurts me.
It really hurts me.
I'm pushing them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has grown with a long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and late rejection led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the unbelievable champion Black Caviar, has called the rules on the day of the race to be "healthy" after the mud or clay has been put on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to mud her leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been it yesterday, just like it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may have a three-month ban on competition because of the day of the racing, where the suppliers started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, the driver responsible for traffic escape was arrested.
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic escape after a biker hit Cobram on the weekend.
The biker was transported to Royal Melbourne Hospital by aircraft after having had serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help an injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
A biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors on pressure claims
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-rugbyleague champions as recommending that his team's coups are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the divorced judges allowed Storm to "press" on their own side when it suddenly won the final score in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos, coach Wayne Bennett, barely covered up his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final score. Bennett called the game Rugbyliigan "shower" and said that two Queensland teams were not "very enthusiastic" with the pressure.
Bellamy defended his team's tacts and said they're just focusing on "contact" in tact.
Bellamy added that his trust added two leading coaches to the Storm because it means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This always comes to talk - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the pressure when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks we have just stressed contact in tactics, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he probably isn't used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes to be spoken at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "comfortable rugby" by reminding the mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "greatly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He had to compare Saturday night's game with our Friday night's game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its kind of players.
He brought out its side 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, so we can play like that.
I'll be more confident when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as resisting important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more pister than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does breaking an exciting line of defense and not making a goal make it?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm will be free this weekend because they have already won the right to the home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks to the pre-final next Saturday evening in AMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Warranty of $200,000 for a Serb man for a drug charge
A man who may be threatened with lifetime in a 40-kilogram cocaine holding company smuggled into Queensland has been released against a $200,000 guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 kilos of drugs for the Solay hunt, who came to South America through Vanuatu and incarcerated in August in Coomera.
Maximovic was seen seeing other defendants at the boat port all morning, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovicia threatens a potential lifetime of a cocaine holding company intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could be in the café for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was worried that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has fixed connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
The mother and stepmother of Maximovic had jointly offered $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
"After reading the jury certificates of both people, it is clear that setting a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police on a daily basis and holds his ban on the outsourcing of evenings and mornings.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl in bed with this phone and then entered the online communication service, where Hogg received numerous unwise pictures of the children that another user sent her.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked into her phone and found some shocking messages, and then immediately she told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, looked into the computers on the spot and found "worrisome" online searches with searchwords used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that he had done this "to tempt paedophiles" on the Internet before he "proclaimed to be a police officer to scare them."
The Deputy Prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that it is an addition - that he is dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had performed the searches on a computer but said that they were done only because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman so that he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, and when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he's getting sick, and he wants to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shrinked and cried.
My mom saw the unspeakable pictures on the phone, and then she met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and he told me that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
On the Ward Road in Dundea, a 23-year-old Hogg admitted guilty of making or taking pictures of ungodly children on June 14th of last year. He violated his guarantees on January 25th of this year and failed to come to court on March 24th of this year.
The defence counsel, Gregor Sim, asked that Hoggia should not be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include "significant sexual elements".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October so that social action would have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted a warranty in this case, but in other cases in progress he has been arrested before the trial.
He was added to the sexual criminal register before the date of conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe made the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the leading staircase.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the fall spread like the virus on social media.
The opening of this House also stained the opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent with anonymous death threats warning them of bouncing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they burst and interrupted him with immediate shouts when he spoke about the state of the country in Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group discipline overseer of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians received messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the title of the message is 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament and that when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be valid.
The supervisor of the group discipline said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "worried" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cut-off efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printing operations from the fastest growing business equipment and services.
Expected job cuts bring about some $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP's bulletin.
"This restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President of HP and CEO, who will lead the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that help companies move into new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the emerging needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it "concentrates on producing non-comparable integrated technology solutions" companies, is reported in the company's newsletter.
The division breaks up a company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University, founded in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "the birthplace of the Piilaakso".
HP has been through enormous restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in the field based on the belief that tightly limited companies are doing better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates have to support an injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's match.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that now it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation will go according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The greatest pity for this latest problem is that Wilsheren's end of the last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It's not about his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when the player tries to return through there is always a risk of additional injuries.
Forming is also an uncomfortable model.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since she debytated six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons he has played Arsenali 157 league games only in 65 games.
In view of Arsenal's larger totality after the period 2007-08, for six periods out of eight it has been one of the teams of Valioliga who has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a witchcraft circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in the disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you return from the injury may be exposed to a period when you need to strengthen the body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will be able to perform a career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his game of the Masters League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudi Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give breath to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite of the F section, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Also, Dinamo has not lost 41 in the game since they produced their own "Unwinning" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the earthquake was striking, with a force of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned how to surrender the Masters League against Monaco last season, and he was motivated by a still distant dream leading the team to the first victory of the European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a series of comedys that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is eyewitness that there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide figures of young men in more than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the person's ability to recover doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of potential mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this social media period, the style goes beyond content and the innocence of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
The values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all this is done at the expense of the internal values - the personal growth and friendship of the inner craving - which will have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video player recently explained, money certainly doesn't get any greater happiness.
The fineness of Freddie was just that it turned this fountain on top of it.
One character did not define their work, but rather their personality, clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey's and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - these humour came to know that yes, men can match all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer worker of Samaritans explained to me: ..."I listened to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how little interaction with a friend can improve feeling."
Men who contact us often experience being unable to speak to friends.
The old idea of "overreaching" is strong, as well as the feeling that if it opens up to problems, it will be seen as weak.
Frends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term livelihoods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you take part in the Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the scenes are re-planned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk's coffee.
Or, what's better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frends are sent at Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 sections, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes a goal and helps PSG smack Malmo's side
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria painted the League of Masters in his debyyt, helping the PSG pass the Swedish team on Tuesday Malmo.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Master League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the League of Masters in his debyyt for less than four minutes, showing the French League champions the way, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advance at Cavan's hit at the 61-minute goal.
Paris, which is in the same A block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish League champion, because the game was not only a poster, but also an improvement in their fourth-final games in the last three rounds.
But although PSG took the scores, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the goal and was later exchanged from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the champions' league at home or in guests, so 2-0-winning produces problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things that we have to do this season," Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win, and we won, although I regret that we did not succeed in making one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the 2-2 match at the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but in the fourth minute he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine side attacker was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran into Marco Verratt's input behind Malmö's defence line and then hit a beautiful finish over Johan Wiland's network in the back corner.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a concubine opponent. He won the Celtic solution match when he reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and five men's defense and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team offered nothing more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic's shot on the attack, which crossed a nip from Kevin Trappi's goalbow.
On the other hand, PSG was damaged at times due to misleading inputs and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five companies only at the first half of the time and then disappointed Cavani when he put the ball in touch with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half of the time.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was just about Ibrahimovic's supply that Di Maria sent a roundshoot, which was striking around the Wiland paint club in the last 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally reached after an hour's game, thanks to the Uruguayan Cavan, the sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had hit the left of Maxwell's cross-fighting.
It ended with Malmo's wishes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the exchange of Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö Coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. Norway said, "The last of our Masters League game was last year in December."
Since then we have played only in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight the carnivals.
I'm picking up a hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the price collapse of basic goods, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its comprehensive debt cut-off plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares for some £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 % of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of crumbled basic goods, as the decline in the Chinese economy burdens demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore shares in the morning shops of the London Stock Exchange.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed a US$ 2.5 billion shareholding in the last week as part of its broader plan to cut its debt burden of US$ 30 billion by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital for 125 cents, which meant a reduction of 2,4 % at the decision price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 % of the group.
Concerns over the long-lasting growth of China have cut the prices of iron ore by about half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China's President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement published on Tuesday in the White House was confirmed.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and there is an answer to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, said in the opinion.
The US President and President's spouse Michelle Obama will arrange for X and his wife Peng Liyuan for dinner after the leadership has held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of President X gives the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China on a number of issues of common interest in global, regional and bilateral matters, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues of disagreement," added.
The visit, which was first published in February, is also expected to deviate in Seattle on its way to Washington to meet a number of US technology leaders before he proceeds towards New York City and the UN General Assembly of September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged online espionage and the increasing inconclusiveness of the country in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the diversity in filmmaking.
Matt Damon joined an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, in their discussion of the diversity that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
The actress who experienced the project Greenlight in the Sunday evening of HBO interrupted this in highlighting the need for different aspects of the project's chosen manuscript to be the principal in the dark.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors in the film, not in the series," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unfaithfully, with the comments "Oho! Wow. Okay," while the Martian actor's comments were hung up.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to invite people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore who beats his white pimp.
The Dear White People's producer demanded that the film be guided by the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded boldly that their guidance "may end up giving us something we do not want".
When the debate was sent, the social media exploded to the resentment of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film label, writing: "Matt Damon talking about the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is HOW it hurts."
After its publication, Twiittaus collected over 5,000 retwittings and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments will be at a time when the accurate racial presentation in the media is in the front of the social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread across the globe and called on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue when presenting the album candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The directors of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to answer the question of the Fox News TV face Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered an anger group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
In fact, it was reported that Damon is involved in that among the entertainers, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the west.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive a prize of $1 million.
The competition programme that ended its seventh season has never had a competitor who would have survived all the obstacles to the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
In the last mission, we had to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, which led him to become the first athlete of all time, who discovered American Ninja Warrior's exhausting 4th portion. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after the difficultly achieved win and was still shocked by winning the $1 million main prize.
"That's why it's great to think about when I've never earned or lived for up to $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter on the final list and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who has succeeded in crossing the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a change in life, he gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels sorry for that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy that it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone differently.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period, the descriptions of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers skipped over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role as a ruiner on Tuesday when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up on the side of the game from Houston Astros in the competition from another American League wild card place.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night a return to the six-written H-san, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, regardless of how to get them," said Tigers' team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts, and then once on the sixth and once again on the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1/3 in a couple of shifts and let three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for an exchanger to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three nights after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shoved the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in exercises), looked much better at hitting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh pair of shifts, and that was their best chance to get back to the game.
Senter Byron Buxton started a pair of shifts by hitting the left line twice.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks settled with one nest, and Simon got burned straight to the other nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maueria, the only player against whom he was set up, at the forefront of Miguel Sano, who ran two nests to the left of Drew VerHagen.
While two runners were on the field and the levelling runner was on the second floor, VerHagen made the third runner of Trevor Plouffe hit the double-game painter.
It was the record of the main series: the 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a security run at the 9th initiative, Mauer ran two hits against Tigers' shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The right-handed player, however, burned in the three, I say, in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used the rusty Phil Hughes at first.
In the first two shifts, Tigers received three runs against the right-handed veteran player who got out of the list of injured before the game was removed because of the inflammation of more than a month's underlife.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but as I got ahead of the game, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I could make some nice inputs with a third pair of shifts."
After Hughes caught the starter in the first nest, he gave the second nest player Ian Kinsler to move between.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the strike, who took himself on the middle-field front to the first level and caused the game to run first.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipes while the runners were on a good run.
Nick Castellanos, a player of the 3rd nick, continued hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned in his attempt to move on to the 3rd nick.
Tigers continued in the second pair of shifts and received one fire, two nests in the situation of the kidnapper James McCann and two fires, one nest in the run center Anthony Goce, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Twins' team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in feed reading and feeding an unrunning third pair of turns, then he became the right-handed follower A.J. Achter.
Three runs of six hits were counted to Hughes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was removed because of the thrust of his shoulder.
He's under investigation by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people since mid-August because of the shoulder-heading attack, but he had to return on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is out, the left-handed singer Daniel Norris will come from the list of injured people to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives after the left-handed feeder David Price was exchanged for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of the rust of the right belly muscle.
The three games of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday in Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set against Minnesota's right-handed feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges us to open the economy more wide to the world
The economy should be more open to the outside world in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, whose task is to guide reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign finance and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said in speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group leading the reform process.
Supporting transparency at the same time as further reforms are being driven forward, further movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group approved the guidelines of the series, which include a negative list of market access limitations, a loosening of border inspection principles, a call by state-owned companies to take private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be drawn up identifying the sectors and companies that cannot be invested.
The system is gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is noteworthy, as it gives a greater role to the market in resource allocation, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also succumb to the power it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide on their own how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors, more areas will be opened to private donors.
"The government does not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for permanent foreign residents, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of legal practitioners and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and the senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were reported in the opinion published after the meeting.
