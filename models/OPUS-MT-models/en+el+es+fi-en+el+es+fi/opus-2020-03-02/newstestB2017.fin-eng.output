A 28-year-old cook was found dead at the Sanfrancisco shopping center.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping center's staircase this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his business straight."
The body found at the Westfield shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, reported on the San Francisco Legal Medicine Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a murder.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the television company ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, formerly a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he was allowed to become a master of the kitchen at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family. We're great," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally gotten his case straight.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and a great heart.
His way of being with the family was to feed us all," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went along with the power.
Despite all the wrongs that happened in the world, he was an unsweeted diamond that shined every day," he says.
All those who know about the case are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's lead number 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors demand new work struggles
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors responsible in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new work struggles in the dispute on the new employment contract.
The junior medical committee (JDC) of the British Medical Union (BMA) is requesting support from its entire government for further work in the fight since the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who participated in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night on Twitter, Mr McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Physician Committee, published a letter to JDC members, where he said that the government had "considered itself" on the issues that McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC government has completely rejected the new draft agreement in its vote and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the BMA government, requesting permission for progressively expanding work struggles since the beginning of September."
For the sake of the dispute, junior doctors have already been in strike six times this year, including the first complete work site ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
After the vote, Johann Malawana, Chief of Junior Physicians of BMA, dismissed his duties because he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract recommended by BMA.
Malawana told the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students participating in the vote.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to reach a settlement and to formally complete the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish official brother in his palace in the golden hall, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties did.
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he was not very warm, even with his own restraint.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdoga repeatedly spoke of Mr Putin's "good friend" — one report says five times.
I didn't keep my bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved like no evil had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm on the contrary.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian head hasn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was raging.
Putin attacked hardest words against Ankara and accused him of stabbing his back.
The injury was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real confidence back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, however, it seemed that the Turkish people were the cause of everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas dominated by ISIS in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only organized to get Putin's apology from President Erdogan.
This is how Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a strong weapon are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly also shaken him.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular a charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel regularly on the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travellers and charter companies will certainly make it easier when air traffic can finally continue.
They put their faith in the late season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when Turkey's imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"The tourists there, the tomatoes back here," was drafted in the article of the Economic Journal Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
The harsh is angry at the west, because it believes that the west reacted incredibly to the attempted coup.
Without forgetting the old resentment of Turkey's EU membership negotiations and the intervention of Putin in matters, Putin, who is eager to exploit the cold intercourse and break Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own concern about the exchange of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, at their top meeting in the prame seafront, could convey the image described by an analyst as a "outside alliance": two countries that experience being rejected and treated by the West, combine their strengths.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peace building, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Much is said that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both Presidents told us at the press conference that they had not dealt with the matter at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of differences between countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO member country by Turkey when shooting down a Russian fighter machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are still in the middle of the talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to RBS Bank's Executive Director, the Bank's activities outside Scotland are reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to withdraw from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, the brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of international sports, examples of Six Nations rugby and Master of Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not use RBS abbreviation.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWeste, with the exception of the main office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS becomes an investment brand and because of the fact that our staff are in service because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
Because the bank itself became a world-wide brand, RBS also became a world-wide brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring sports.
"It is now time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the Bank's Executive Director.
"Three years ago it would have been very striking if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced the brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori raided Predilection to win in Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettori will shower champagne after winning twice in Newmarket, which meant for him 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000 wins in the British championship series in Newmarket Friday.
On this ridge he reached by horse riding Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this streaming pole in the races running on a steady track.
He's been in the same position before. Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold master jockey dettori, who previously won in Ghayar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family's here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and 20 000 people.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Dettori accepts the hobbies with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the breeze in the barrier competitions, and they have won a master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4 300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine times Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's not a surprise that he just reached this ridge where only a few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical prominence is what separates him from others.
He is a fantasy representative for the race hunt, his enthusiasm and karsima has brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6 000 races already, unless he would compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie's riding career in the British races has been a victorious for nearly 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for the British racer, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori fanned his accomplishment in a way that was symbolic by flying down his horses.
"From flying inlets to flying downlets Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British race hunting for two decades.
We've got a ride up and down the hills.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived the flight accident and had a drug abuse because of the ban on competition.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had difficulties starting, but showed admirable strength of nature, showed his suspects and returned to their best.
And for a while he's not going to stop his career – Dettori has recently said that he wants to continue the race until he is at least 50 years old."
Putin dismissed administrative chief Sergei Ivanov.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his manager Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin's statement, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his role as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no reason for dismissal was given.
The mission was appointed Deputy Head of Ivanov from 2012 onwards.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Perino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol department and the government office, reports the Russian-language website of Kremlin.
He thanked Putin for his appointment: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making bills and monitoring how the instructions you have given will be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended vaino for his successor.
Are smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he also has a KGB history.
As head of government, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a Russian state television meeting with President Putin, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from his mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, particularly under the parliamentary elections.
Are fired as a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as a possible president would suddenly want to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I've been the President's Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he acted as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service of KGB.
When Putin served as the head of the KGB Security Service (FSB) at the end of the 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At the time, it was thought that Ivanov would become Russian President Putin after the second term, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
The mission, however, went to another close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, and then he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – A star of the FBI Investigators series Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios produced a series of stories about the dismissals in their joint communication.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I am sorry that this happened," he says when he spoke.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, published later, will be reported in ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously on the comedy series Dharma & Greg, a 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in the news he published on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the end of the series, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th production season starts in the United States on 28 September.
The mysterious shore of fish to the Banfian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind salads that have fallen to the ground under the swivel storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published a vision of photographic material in Perisscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five centimeters of fish.
The Queensferry crossings have now been connected to Fife.
A project of £1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing of the north deck and the countryside, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fifee.
It is the first of four parts between the "civil threats" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 steel ropes.
A project of £1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry's overnight.
We are all witnessing real progress in building a bridge, and more than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight, building the bridge between the shore and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
The whole bridge deck is now almost 79% in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete money in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first bridge is always an important urinary pillar in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction sectors.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower pillar, then we had to close the remaining north side (i.e. the countryside) block.
This was done by pulling 700 millimeters south from the north side of the countryside.
This was a massive and at the same time a highly accurate operation.
Massive, because of 222 metres and about 6,000 tons of weight from the land and had to be drawn up in a 3% angle of inclination.
And a great deal of precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
Moelfre Bay's Rescue Department tells me about three men's marvelous rescue.
Three men who came to the water on the front of Anglesey's fishing boat were saved like a miracle trade.
Moelfre RNLI's marine rescue station issued an alarm on Friday at 13.20 p.m. in the Moelfre Bay Bay of its crew.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued uncontrolled without a pilot.
"We saw the boat roaming right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, driving the rescue boat of Moelfre.
By the time we got into the waters, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted by a boy and without a rescue line.
They were all taken on board the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It's a miracle that these three men who are in the water are still alive and fully healthy.
There was an emergency firewall on the boat's engine, but for some reason it was cleared from the man who was driving the boat when it fell.
They were really lucky on their way."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and move.
Initially the screen time was only taken by television watching, then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it's great to note that technology and outsidership do not close each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application with characters coming from video games created in the 1990s (which were later made also drawing series, game cards and other related products).
Like many popular cultural events, this also stopped a little before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Launching in other countries was delayed because of the great interest that overloaded the servants.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
Shortly explained, players will go out looking for pokemons that are monitored using GPS. When the pokemon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the phone display) or "captured".
The wildlife has tricked the video game as a younger generation playing and raised the back of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the average person takes in a day.
Recently, the Washington Post reported on the Cardiogram application of Apple Watch, which found within two days of the game's launch that 30 minutes a day of travelling numbers rose suddenly from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know who of the users play the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw information of the numbers of exercises.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to rise up on the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have echoed deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be diminished.
The likelihood of regular movement of cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The greatness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This brings about three basic health - supportive things — exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
In the course of the hunt, it is possible to have even new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes a disgraceful devil.
And yes, someone can play when he walks to the door.
What about it?
The break-in is done.
For even though smart phone applications like Fitbit could already follow your activity earlier, they did not give reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The new attraction disappears and the use decreases in time.
However, the success of Pokemons brings more games in which applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which increases the exercise of people who go after them and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in the women's fences multiplaying.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these people.
Dynamic jumps.
I don't have any trouble with the guys.
The jaws floating on a stay.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympics winner.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old teline forceman won the championship of the multiplayer and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lights.
His total point 62.198 was clearly better than his "Final Five" team colleague Aly Raisman and Russian bronsimitalist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles presents itself in the final competition of women's telecommunications competition on Thursday 2016 at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the championship of the multiplayer, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even as the best of all times.
Biles burst into tears when his total final point came to be seen and his long way to this moment ended.
Achievement takes the species into completely new dimensions and raises him to the same category of sports by other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely overpowered in his species for the last three years. He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and accurate programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the most powerful teline forceman of all time".
In Brazil, there was yet another final competition that took place, above all, between Biles and his own and the burden borne by the higher expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring less than a handful of gold medals would be tried as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman, after winning gold and silver at the final contest of the individual teline competition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday 2016.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as an i-point for the co-ordinated and retired Martha Karoly's farewells.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of anything before when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program – which includes a volt series known as his card – has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were young, his mother, Aimee Boorman's mother, had become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl when this was a day home trip in the gym where Boorman trained.
He hasn't lost any multiplayer competition since summer 2013 and the winning pipe will probably continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead on two rounds, it was like a fabric.
There was still a boom and a mansion where Biles is a defending world champion.
He returned to the leadership post after receiving 15,433 points and crowned the result of his permanence at 15,933 points.
Raisman graciously hugged him while waiting for the final points — which was just formal — and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white and blue glamorous border color when the dream written in his book of art was realized.
Raisman's performance was a small revival to a four-year-old competition when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina on a re-track.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team "grandmother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his stay program and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old and widespread tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
Police report three musics in the car, listening to a serial killer being killed.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most destructive mass murder of Phoenix for ten years, and the victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Malea were shot in a car parked in the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then escaped by another car, they say.
The police suspect that there must have been no robbery because the attacker didn't take handbags and $2,900 found in another adult victim's hallucination.
The Phoenix police reporter, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the murder is related to four earlier attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin American areas within four months.
"It is common for events that they have occurred in residential areas in front of their homes," Howard told the subsidiary of CBS's television and radio company KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrators are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a bulletin stating that the open-packed car was empty was shot only half an hour before the 3rd murder. The shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found the shells and took the car's seat from the bullet and engine space with the bullet chips.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: "Cases become better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of the other agemates, Edmund has a microcephaly, or birth-born childhood, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and his husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far that they suggested investing a child in institutional care.
"My primary reaction was that I didn't believe that practice was at all anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund got up to sit down and started to contact only when he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
She's happy to play with her two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invention of a sign that means "sing to me."
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not mean just the ordinary sign language, but it also includes the sign made up by Edmund himself.
The background of microcephalia may have several different diseases: inherited, such as in the case of Edmund, or pregnant viral infections such as ashtray or zikavirus.
Symptoms and forecasts have great variations.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those with zikavir.
Picciuto recalls the emotion storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I've done it all the time: what happens to us,
What will happen to us?"
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for predictions in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth failures caused by zikavirus.
"Cases are getting better.
It's the way things work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Rainfalls and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
Louisiana's governor declared on Friday an emergency because of heavy roads and widespread floods, and more rains are still expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded over their crusts and spread to a wide area as a result of strong hardships.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to flooding areas.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, reports that the Agency will receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags.
According to Steele, the county of Tangi malahoa alone has asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, more water may come from 76 to 127 mm.
A flood warning was given in southern Alabama on Friday, when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River near the Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the regulator Alek Krautmann, many of the houses in the rivers may fall under the flood in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in the Ascension district constitute a threat because the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas Lake.
On Friday at 9 a.m., the Tickfaw River, flowing south of the border of the state of Mississippi, was already higher than ever.
The rescue work continued in the counties of Amiten and Wilkinson in the southeastern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and nephew were previously near Gloster among the saved.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He was warned by the other closest nephew.
"We got up, and the water came on a continuous feed," Hansford says.
"It stretched into my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she has never seen the river rise so high over the 48 years she has lived in the region.
Hansford tells me that he and his family members have injuries, and he himself is the only swimper.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they kept protection on Friday.
The regulator Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly, as hardships continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of the information from the observer close to Livingston that between midnight and Friday morning it had rained almost 350 mm.
Krautmann says that the soil was drastically wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities report that, due to the flooding of hard roads and streets, people in the district of Tangi malahoa had to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangi malahoa had told the subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has overcame both of them.
Robby Miller, head of the district, reports that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been imprisoned by the flood.
The evacuated have been opened shelters to the cities of Amiten and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to retreat," he says.
In Hammond, in the county of Tangi malahoa, almost twenty streets had to be shut down because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sand bags to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"For the last time we had a big flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a city government member.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississip, the rains continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, Rescue Director of Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday, a handful of flooded houses were reported, but on Friday, no information had been received so far.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods store, reports that he has lived in the Amiten region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
A six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has several bullets in his body, survives the firing attack in Philadelphia
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old who has been shot this week in town.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said the boy had several shot wounds in his neck, his leg, his arm and his stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," he told Grandma Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and several surgery has been done to him.
The family tells the television company that the boy is supposed to survive.
He was starting the first class at local high school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old men were also shot.
The second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, reports CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, a child was found at the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The place of the event was full of raid guns that come from different weapons of raid.
"It is quite clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the aisle.
There have been several armed fighters on site, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia police station told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the region.
No arrests have been made, and the police are hearing that they're going through surveillance videos.
The other 6-year-old who was shot in the city this week was a girl whose hand was misleadingly shot while playing on Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I call women's teline training team the Olympics, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been as overpowerful as it is now.
Secondly, three of this team's gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin-sized women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female liner has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose up as a surprise winner in the races, and the whole of America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and masterful teline training programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the women's individual competition.
Aly Raisman, a teammate, won silver.
Views are like this at the top of the species, but it does not look like the same at teline training lessons across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), because in the next teline training team there will be only four gymnasts, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly's coach.
However, the reality is that telecommunications training is an expensive sport and gymnastics are mainly practised in private telecommunications services that support their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, spaces, trips, appearances, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers, trainers and family members) etc.
Most telecommunications services are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
Teline-forcers' education takes place in these clubs, and it means expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasticists.
Simone Biles Coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez Coach Maggie Haney have both trained the hobbies of the species since they started the teline training.
We need to organize a more affordable and more accessible teline training for those countless young girls who have been excited by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own ferry training foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity to train more than 15,000 young people (mainly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will extend our activities to my home town in Detroit so that we can offer high-quality telecommunications training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
Teline training develops strength, humility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings sustainable benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has been excited by thousands of young girls who now want to start a teline training, and it's absolutely great.
Participation in some kind of sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic Gold, and for motivating so many of your stories for young girls to start their way into good, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for new strikes
The ministers hoped to decide on the wages and changes to working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association) trade union representing doctors, but 58% of the 37 000 junior doctors, or specialised doctors, voted against the proposal.
In July, the Minister of Health, Hunt, told me about plans to reach a contract on a mandatory basis and said that the British Public Health System (NHS) is "no-one's country" and that all additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors move to a new agreement, which includes changes to the practices of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Physicians' Committee, delivered an opinion last night, stating that "Junior doctors are still extremely prepared for the proposed agreement, particularly fearing that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks for the first doctors to be transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has reacted unwillingly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, junior doctors will be ready for new work measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed nearly 13 000 routine measures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strikers' doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British trade union representatives.
The BMA trade union wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be involved in the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS workers, appealed to junior doctors not to take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Working activities achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the extreme limits and cause concern, distress and disturbance to patients, caregivers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Physician Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the overseer and the disclosure of misconceptions.
Employees were hopeful that continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from careers, education costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, freedom of study and gender pay gaps – were a sign of how seriously workers, the Health Education England responsible for health education and the Ministry of Health would like to adhere to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May."
A day of n. 2.40 € liver medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are taking about €2.40 a day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer term use.
The risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease is reduced by tikagrelor anticoagulation.
The medicine is currently being given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS) has advised that tikagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has advised that tikagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce further the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people receive a heart attack each year, of which four hundred relapse or get a stroke.
Cardiac seizures and strokes are caused by a fat substance that is accumulating to the blood vessels' walls, which gives birth to platelets.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from getting into the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot drops, it can pass along with the bloodstream and prevent blood flow into the brain, which will result in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
The tikagrelor manufactured by British AstraZeneca, which is sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of tulps.
It is recommended that tikagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction of 60 milligrams and aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Carole Longson, professor of the NICE Center, says: "Although effective disease progression and symptoms effective prevention methods are available, even a quarter of those who have received a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can very negatively affect the quality of life of man.
We have received evidence that tikagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation for temporary use of tikagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of tikagrelor, especially with regard to haemorrhagic activity, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for longer periods.
The political correctness of the elections in the Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The political corrective atmosphere led to the closure of the eyes of the broadly spread electoral vile Muslim communities, revealing the government's report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticized the police, electoral observers and city councils for having shut their eyes off the electoral vile "for the sake of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Mr Pickles, former Minister of Regional Administration and currently known as the anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside voting places so that the intimidated voters could have been protected.
He proposed that voters should present an identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they came to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only indicate his or her name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize fingers after the vote on the unsourced muscle so that no one can vote twice.
"Sir Eric says you should protect more people."
He calls for improved access by journalists to State Council documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent elections, but also to combat fraud and culture that favours corruption and economic interests in local governments," he says.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom asked for a report after the vote scandal in East London, Tower Hamlet.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should then be dismissed from his duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman "faithfully falsified" his Muslim community's religious feeling and impaired his critics by accusing them of racism and Islam.
Rahman was said "to use his campaign as the basis for the religious duty of every faithful Muslim to vote for him".
Even 300 voices were questionable or misleadingly given to the person by making himself another person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud from the whole country.
He expressed his particular concern about the postal bill, where members of the Muslim community in high ranks were reported to have pressured people to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requesting an identity certificate at the polling place.
The report states: "There is evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the parents, in particular in the background communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes on such action "politically correct" because of ethnicity and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from voting tickets, so as to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also requires more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to submit an identity certificate before the vote.
Baptizing fingers after voting on an unleashed mussel so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Prohibiting political activists from dealing with full-posted voices and postcards.
The right of the police to form guard chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise charges of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff monitors the rule that only one person can go to the polling room at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and considers it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from their role as a result of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without any doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective "traffic checks" of the offices responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"The decision of the Judiciary last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden electoral bluff and the banning of it by some."
The resemblance of the Olympic biker with Duchess Catherine and other twins in the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics became wild of the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But social media debates show that this 24-year-old Olympics representative is not the only athlete fighting for the championship who has an equal appearance with a well-known person.
For the sake of the famous faces of Rio's races and all of our display screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood publishers is evident.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (Vas.) has been compared to the United States men's archery team since the child.
In addition to the duchess Catherine's double-sole, on the bike tracks, many people have noted in social media how one of the bows could be the actor's favourite Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
The U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after the photos published on him, which strikingly reminds him of Wolf of Wall Street's film.
Ellison was aware of the upheaval of social media and admitted to having heard from the child that he was reminded of DiCapriota.
"I don't see the resemblance so big, maybe barbecue and fig, except for," he said to Brady Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm taking this as a compliment."
In the contests in London 2012, the British length jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris were accentuated, which will undoubtedly be brought forward even more in these races.
Aliya Mustafina, a great and obvious Russian cheerleader, has been called Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
In addition, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgia has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known from the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "atletic version" of the Inception film actor.
Similarly, for a long time, there has been a marked similarity between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actress Josh Hartnett, which highlights both strong eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver star, Russian Yulia Efimova reminds the actress Annalynne McCordia, not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and lightning hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian, according to his fans, is a "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon's Leviticus".
These two iron women, a football star Hope Solo (va.) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (oik.), remind each other of their face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was pleased when others also saw the same appearance.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for a couple of similarities.
A tweeter recently said that he was happy when "others on the Internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's similarity."
The U.S. football star and the Dexter series actress really resemble each other stunningly from their faces and faces.
Many have also seen the same appearance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and the actress Laura Linney and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna return! in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Communist apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis, instead of Ai Yanhan's fourth one, in a 4 x 200-metre free swimming message, shocked the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic exhibition on Wednesday.
Canada's broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smells" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to open his own opinions at the end of a 4x200-metre-free swimming message for women.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporters to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went out fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, uied during the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and left 1,61 seconds from Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim in China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator's tone and language use.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was in the broadcast yet."
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swimmer of 4 x 200 metres, was described by the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with angry Byron MacDonald's critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The Twitters didn't hold back their words when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
Twiiter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, host of CBC's broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speech: "We apologize for the comment made on the swim performance.
This was a sad choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC finally had to regret more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
Then CBC copied and glued its regrets to over 90 other tweeters' comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
A public apology was also made quickly by the TV company.
"We are sincerely sorry about these statements and that they were sent.
At last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized and tried to defend his speech by saying that he didn't mean it personally.
"I would like to apologise for my comment I made last night after the women's communication," MacDonald said in the CBC Olympics.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Not to mention, it is clear that I did not mean anything despising with my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, an unhindered underwear in the middle of the trade, a woman was shocking customers.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to make up for underwear.
He continued to worsen the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his leg and put them back in the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four underpants at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain at the Folkestone Bouverie Place Shopping Centre, where a woman tried underpants for everyone and put them back in the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store, Jenny Davidson, tells me that after she tried underwear, she dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People were not to believe in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the shop, took her underpants off the shed, stripped her own tri size and underpants and put them on.
He didn't try to do it inadvertently, but he did it completely without shame.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he tried out of his leg, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided that he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes — nor thought about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had come from."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent town, goes on to say, "How disgusting to think someone is taking the underwear that someone else has worn and not washed."
The case happened Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that commercial staff tried to remove these clothing items from the sale when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underpants home and notice that someone else has come to them without being washed after that," adds Davidson.
The Prime Minister commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from sales.'
That's how you're defending yourself from an armed attack against Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the great champion of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, and asked for advice on how to cope with a gun in the vicinity of a robber or assaulter.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you in front or behind you.
If the attacker is approaching backwards, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the range, Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and strikes the attacker on your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee in the neck, and when he goes out of pain twice, slap him on the face with a gun pipe and back off by holding the gun directed at him.
The technique is similar if the armed attacker is approaching the front. You must move away from the fireplace, seize the weapon and rotate it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with the fist on the chest. Turn the gun off the attacker's grip, back off and keep the weapon targeted on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
See how Mizrachi does it in the video.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is by handing over your hand — unless you are the Grand Master of Krav Maga.
World traveler Ian Wright licks the most dirty places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his revolts to a hard test by licking the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
A Suffalowwriter and travel guidewriter Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handcuffs in Piccadilly Circus, a train washing button and a Russian general telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see and show the viewers where they were not pushing.
The experiment was made a documentary film by Ian Wright – a follow-up to the internal force, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the washing button of the train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen lavatory.
On the way to Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening good bacteria in the intestine and about their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he arrowed caused but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright became known at the beginning of his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Undoubtedly, the licking of the handicrafts of railway stations and the washing pressure of the toilet challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "Since I was a child, I've been quite careless about my health and injected into my mouth all sorts of things, such as soil, worms, and water."
In the film, he really showed his reputation.
The border only came in a rogue public bathroom in Russia.
Luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
As a result of the comparison, it should be stated that in counter-washed hands the amount is usually less than 60.
The border came to the Russian public bathroom where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units — in counter-washed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright explores together with Valio in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright – Internal Power Traces, where the number of bacteria is visible in different locations, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the most horrible smell I've smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing more dirty than that.
This place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – After Internal Power in cooperation with Valio.
The Valio Gefilus, containing milk acid bacteria and C- and D-vitamins, helped to strengthen the good bacterial and resistance capacity of the intestine.
Mr Niko Mountainmaa, head of the selection of snacks, juices and new products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we ended up thinking of asking Ia to join us."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into wider contact instead of just talking about products and to tell us about our daily environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and we can provide more information about it to consumers in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our humor!"
Tom Hakala, directed by the film, adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some objects was easier for Ian, while some were rather bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In the 2015 poll, 84 % of respondents linked milk acid bacteria in particular to the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 % reported that at least once they used products that added milk acid bacteria.
The disturbing family destroyed a rental house owned by the city in Saltash, Cornwall.
The disturbing family left behind the damages of 50,000 pounds to the city owned by the rental house after they had been evicted because of the terrorization of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and his husband Shaun Trebilcock have been expelled from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwallin, following complaints against numerous couples.
When the couple had been forced out of the apartment, representatives of the tenant company stated that the apartment was shocked to be in remodeling.
There were ammoble holes in the walls, floor basins had been torn off, garbage had been spread to the floors and walls had been crushed with graffites.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says he's afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to tolerate this.
There is much to weigh about, as property is likely not to be known as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is evil, just like its name."
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment on a regular basis, and the police said there were street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug use and mediation, and loud yelling, argument and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the rental agreement, received an order for unsocial behaviour.
In several rooms under demolition, old waste was found.
Drugs had been sold out of the house before, and floor shutters had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family fought on the street and the police were regularly forced to call.
Cornwall's home office expelled the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks of additional time to voluntarily move away.
Silent neighbors were grateful for the eviction — they said their lives were earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived in their neighbor for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
The trash and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is an accident that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and family behaviour, since the decision is always the last measure that the Cornwall House Office will consider.
This case was extremely difficult, as behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the Community who took part in the work and offered courageously to give us information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give a message that unsocial behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells me that three of the boys of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already in twenty.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
The house workers now have to clean out the waste sheds around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as beans and other supplies, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine when he was found guilty of holding class B drugs to sell it.
He claimed that in 2013 he was in a car accident for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard moving to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were wasted with graffiti.
The police say they demand a decision for tenants who violate the rules of the rental contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police say this eviction works as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as to those who have to suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never accept criminal and unsocial behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, low-shore military jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal's Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion airplane of the Portuguese Air Force crashed stunningly low.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to escape when the low-flying jet flew over the full beach.
Dramatic images show how the military aircraft is almost touched by tourists taking sunshine on the sandy beach in the Northern Portuguese Aveiro.
The vacationers rose to their feet in an understandable concern about the rocket of the engines of the shower machine, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images of the dramatic passing by and the videos of vacationers published in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It crossed the beach twice very low, and there was a time when it looked like it would fall to the ground."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure that the machine would fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveiiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly came into sight and fled at a stunning low.
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight aimed at identifying coastal fishing vessels, which was why the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by close forest fires adversely affected visibility, but according to the air forces, this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the mainland-Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
Portugal's air forces today reported that due to the poor visibility of the flame of the hero and the smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exposing the results of the first half of the year, better than expected
The Social and Health Circumstances of Southern Karelia (Exote) made a better result in January-June EUR 3.4 million.
The result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
Treatment warranty was carried out in all activities.
This year, the exotte will try to shorten the operational lines.
The exodus covers the surplus of the deficit previously born.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and purchase measures in patients.
The result of the year as a whole is projected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
For example, the government will discuss the mid-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border ice-creams swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Maritime Guard School swore a military vow on Friday.
The military whales of the Border and Maritime Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special boundary ice cream course was held in the sports field of the equipment.
The Soldier vow swore 70 men.
Special border ice-creams are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They're serving 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were picked up for a special border icehead.
They were invited to the selection tests 250.
Special border icekeepers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting during the felony was attended by five border forces during the war.
The average age of those with them is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of burglars ahead... criminal investigations help to solve crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police units has operated the RTA, i.e. the Criminal Information and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlin are present in the häme police department.
That's what you're pulling out of Lahti's position, Sergeant.
He's a Chief of Staff in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinu.
Everybody's working in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, sees Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will produce different reports to the other police.
In a shame, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the newest working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, which means that the police would leave more and more pills in the rings until they get an alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where it is most needed.
The reform of the police administration involved the establishment of a criminal intelligence centre, its fewer than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa is a national director of the activities.
The PTR units work according to their names at the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in the areas divided by police agencies and are responsible for providing information to both local police and national units.
Information extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work, the RTA unit is responsible for knowing what is happening throughout the police service.
Information also extends beyond the borders of your institution, because it does so in crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills in basic police.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes that are similar to each other through registers, alerting mission databases and findings.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of working.
The handprint is also displayed at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the way it works, the author is made up of a certain kind of image.
Scheduling can be done either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not carry their necks up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus attempting to prevent police anti-criminal attempts.
The police will report on the methods publicly if they anticipate that they will cause a threat.
Such a case was, for example, a news story of early summer, a way of marking vacant dwellings in housing breaks.
That's where the authors put the apartment on the outside door, the knitting needle, or the tape piece in which they tried to see if the people were really on their way.
Preliminary examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The Analytics Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever order a protocol on the right of contenders, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with the gloves.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from the police of Hämee, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the police of Eastern Finland, Detective Sami Joutjärveä from the police station of Joensuu and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to design practical activities.
In the background of the decline in labour and finance levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation will collect information outside its own institution and Finland's borders.
A Londonian schoolgirl who joined the fathers was killed in Syria
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolchildren associated with Fathers last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Counsel Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian free attack on Raqqa, which is the base of Daddy in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she was just planning to escape from the country that was ravaged by the war and to return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and as a will so that people will understand this as a real risk to the war zone - and that it will cause people to give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 together with two other East London school girls on a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the highest court if he's elected
Mr. Harry Reid, Senate Democrat, says he is convinced that Mr. Hillary Clinton, President of the Democrats, will appoint Merrick Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republican Representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Senate mayor Mitch McConnellin, the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "not with great certainty".
Reid's informant later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether this would name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "smoke the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the principal judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the county of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans who prevent the appointment of Garland are candidates for President Donald Trump's "advisors" and "aiders".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked caletters belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and markets the 1970s styled and Pirell's inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of public secretion models, they want to find top models for the next generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats earlier this year, said that his nakedness in the paper differs from the old school's Playboy magazines, because he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
Looks like he's thinking about the calendar, too.
"We must bring back timelessness and classical nudity, where women, wherever men, can enjoy and be inspired by these excelling images of the women's body," says Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful artwork."
As a model, they want to send their photos through the network or participate in open selection sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Lone, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you were able to write your angry objection to the commentary section with the name "NoEveryone"Men of Central Age, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is no bum behind the new vinyl discs that have been spoken about when the Millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is a backdrop of middle age nostalgia.
The age of the newly purchased person with vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in age group 18-24 are less likely to buy.
Also, it is not just the desire of the hobbyists to play on the plates, but it is emotionally important: the older buyers of vinyl discs are more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy the sole (69 % v. 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been televised, the camera would follow me as I walked along the vibrant Soho Street, wearing a grey jacksuit on me. I would elephantly, bend my hand into a cup and say something about traditions such as, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its attractiveness and rubbishness when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special disk stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these stores and try to assess their age and quality.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray's movement (customs at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (customs at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends an extra time acquainting with the offer of the stores.
I'm gonna ask if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These records fill his living room walls, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly his available income. He is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he was young and without money had to sell.
"I got a lot of things in the late '60s and early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my worst."
Wez, 25-year-old Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has found a new kind of human flow that has been influenced by media hype. These people have heard of the coming of vinyl discs again and now feel compelled to buy their old albums back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the bum of certain age-old vinyl resins.
And what about the alleged emotional significance of sound records?
In just a few seconds you realize in a movement like Phonika that they offer comfort to the same spirits of the community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been harassed, in particular, by the non-contact payment system.
The digital world may shock some vinyl fans to whom returning to familiar disc boxes means persistence and reminds you of the lucky days of youth.
"I think that sometimes it fills some hole or material property will be acquired for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts somewhere else."
"We're like social workers!" Wez's coworker's behind the record pile.
The ICM opinion study in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their disk.
The opinion study also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the buyers of the vinyl disc have no record player at all.
At this point, I would probably look like a serious face while I looked at the pine-boss nova collections.
The new arrival of the wine albums also involves the "pokaali-evenmiö", which has been detected by Jonny, 42, of the Sounds of the Universe (at the moment three middle-aged men).
"One of the customers recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disk so he can put it in his shelf," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not large, but they are.
For them materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they still don't have a record player.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers, who are just starting the hobby."
The customer is considerably more varied in Fop, where I can reach next. The movement has owned a whole layer for vinyl discs.
There are 70-year-old couples, photographs of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is happy, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: the sounding of the jazz in place of the newest sex of Wild Beasts is a sharp synthesizer poppy.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to observe a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppi for a few minutes and watched various albums at the discount.
He's looking rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They pay a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the liquor's fineness is ...", he lets the enchanted uprising and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who would think of jumping jeans, but who, instead, gather around the Polaroid cameras for a while, I see a father and a daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley disk player.
On the left there is a staircase filled with wall filled with Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's discs: mixing contemporary music and classics, key disks for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just as an element of decoration and part of it so high that they don't even get high.
They're from the pure "art vinyl" embroidery.
But given that all ways to get attention to these albums may mean more money to the sector and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group, most likely to have more time and money than most, also has the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl discs.
Although my studies show that the results of YouGov are true, at least in Soho's disc shops, they do not exclude a large number of women collectors and vinyl fans who actually exist in both the disc stores and online platforms.
These people are likely to be close in school or work.
I'm sure they don't spend their Thursday mornings at Berwick Street's disco shops, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television shooter who looks scary and staring at unhealthy middle-aged men.
Holker, i.e. ice shark, is the longest living spine — a video report
According to researchers, the longest living spinal cord of the earth is an ice shark.
Researcher Julius Nielsen said that the eldest ice shark was aged from 272 to 512 years in the study.
The French Court rejected the application for the dismantling of the trade in the jungle camp
The French Court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to require the demolition of ten temporary shops and restaurants by thousands of refugees in the jungle camp.
During this week's legal proceedings, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be allowed to disperse 72 temporary trades on refugee camps, selling different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offering haircuts to the inhabitants of the refugee camp.
According to Calais' Prefective Authorities, these shops and restaurants must be disposed of because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a gray economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as the free meals offered by the state-supported organization and by others are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of Calais's prefect "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the camp's food shops, cafes and restaurants are far more important than just offering food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places below the disaster was the Jungle Book Kids Café, which is unsuccessful and offers 200 meals a day, hours of English and French, and asylum counselling for hundreds of children without guardians who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address where children's cafeteria is required to be maintained.
According to the letter sent to the Guardian, closing it would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
On Friday, two charitable organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of inhabitants of the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 since the sharp increase in the number of fires in the summer.
The price of food falls clearly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
Food is cheaper in Finland to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in Finland in three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, the price of food has fallen secondly in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
From comparisons only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
Information is provided by the Director of Statistics Centre Development, Ilkka Lehtisen, published in the Information & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that have been related to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010th century, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices suffered close to the 1994 price level.
It was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper a year.
The import bans imposed by Russia on food now weighing the price which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has therefore increased and agricultural prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finland's consumer in a short way," Lehtinen says.
The price reduction has also been influenced by the tightened competition between industry and trade.
The large trade chains of the S group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland, however, is still not a steward of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015 food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the press, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the controlling countries had the same rate of VAT, they would be sold in Finland from the same level of wages to the third lowest food.
The lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finnishs.
"If we want to reach the EU level at the price of food, we must have VAT to halve the average level of EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The Lehtinen notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
It's not like school anymore.
One who returns to the school seat may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new educational plan has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for more years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautiful writing is given up, and instead, schools are starting to practice encoding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and societal learning is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before, it was thought that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is how they try to make schooling more interesting.
The world's longest-lasting spine was found. The ice shark could live for up to 400 years.
The well-known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) will only reach the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone in the world today.
In the animal community, it only passes by the Icelandic dungeon whose oldest known individual has been timed for 507 years.
Greenland sharks swim all the way to the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch over dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the followers only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified the old 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radio-carbon driving of eye lenses.
For at least 272 years, the average age of the investigated sharks was demonstrated.
The two largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks reach relative maturity only more than square meters, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The research published Science.
You're fired from Stockmann for nearly 300. You don't want to cut out salesmen.
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The cooperative companies in the difficulty-driven company ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take place as redundancies," Stockmann reports.
It states that the number of dealers in the goods houses will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees are offered new jobs as a salesman.
The two negotiations in Stockmann concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is targeting an annual cost saving of around EUR 20 million, to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulty of Stockmann getting profitable from the merchandise store.
Although the group's adjusted business result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, trade in merchandise is still losing.
According to Stockmann's former CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in the stores have failed to meet the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personal reductions are necessary to ensure the positive performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen notes in the newsletter.
The results of the second quarter's improvement were particularly the success of Lindex's clothing chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results for the best second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover for this year will decrease last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The center of low pressure on the north of Finland will keep the weather rainy Friday, says the meteorologist of HS Ilona Láng.
There are also rainbows in the middle of the earth, but the southern is the rainbow.
The temperature is no longer very summerly, because mercury remains below 20 degrees in the entire country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees remain.
Kenya's general sports team shakes the dopingskandal trick of coaches a strange explanation
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared on the land team as an athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete that Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan group member, reported that the identity of Anzrah was revealed after he had given a sample in the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials came to report to the Anzrah authorities.
So I said Anzrah was sent home, for he committed his crimes against the Kenyan land team.
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, for your news agency for Reuters.
Olympians' general sports start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Last year, Rotich was placed in the MM contests on his way to the fourth and has a preview of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was only on an accreditation card for free meals in the kite.
When antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he feared that he would be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio sports stadium rubberizes its vacuum
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow the sports.
In Rio, a struggle on the medals of general sports began on Friday, but the world's top individuals were able to present their skills to a confusing empty viewhouse.
On Friday, the Rio organizers reported that only 58% of the first day's morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulling out of the cheerful people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The olympians in Rio have already attracted attention before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been displayed in the rugby, melon and horseback watching rooms.
When Brazil's medal masters Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in legendary Copacabana, it was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 people were now full of about 30%.
Badly explained, at least, the fact that Brazil, which is struggling in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
Yet even the first match for the Brazilian football team was not filled with football stadiums.
Mario Andrada, an informant of the race organizers, told me that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to be sold," Andrada said Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million flags of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have ranged from about nine euros to more than one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species in a school country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in the Rio stadium in the morning.
Even a beach ball in Copacaba sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There's enough people in the newspapers.
New way to protect the environment - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation will participate in the new ways of natural protection.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically important habitats in its own ownership.
Thereafter, private companies and entities may redeem their rights by money to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lap.
The land has been distributed virtually into blocks which the willing may obtain against payment of the right of holder.
The holder shall receive a veto right in 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Procuring rule is something concrete that can be left to be inherited or given to be a gift.
You don't have to go carry banderolles or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," Juha Leviäkangas, a management company, explains.
The person who has acquired the right to rule receives the exact location information of his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the section.
The name of the holders of the rights acquired on the Foundation's website can be found on the same map on which the sections of the land are located.
The leväkanga sees its natural protection procurement as a risk only for the Foundation's activities to change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The fundamental idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of habitats so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has obtained its initial capital from its founders.
The Foundation's purpose is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish borders and plans to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Center on August 13-19.
The robbers of bikes are abhorring the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves torment Finland's major cities, the worst of Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in relation to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of reported cycling thefts to the police, Helsinki Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles stolen in the 10 largest cities in January-August this year and their portions per thousand per capita.
In addition to Turu, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thefts per thousand people.
On the other hand, the police in Espoo and Kouvola reported only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double thefts in relation to the number of residents compared to others," describes the police inspector of the Police Government, Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the point of comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The generality of the guarantees can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how much of the wheels are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Tommi Ree Police Government considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise at the top of the line.
The number of robberies goes largely according to the number of studying and cycling cities.
The Turku has a close center, short distances and lots of wheels available to thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a priority mover," Reen says.
All over Finland, in January-August, there have been a little fewer bike robberies than in the corresponding period of last year.
Yet there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police will receive little more than 20,000 cycling robberies a year.
It means 50 to 60 fillers each day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
Actually, the thieves are taking more wheels, because only a few of the victims report the robbery to the police.
Reen asks people to make a criminal report on the cycling theft, even if fewer than every ten police officers reported are cleared.
Typical cleared cycling is one where the police will be informed of the robbery immediately and the thief will be caught in his blood.
"The ways are also cleared during other investigations when, for example, stolen spins can be found in the drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly on their own, or in connection with police investigations, reports senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen from, for example, wheelchairs, indoor yards, warehouses and wheelchairs, i.e. practically wherever they are usually stored.
Like the previous years, Jopos, most of the individual bike models are stolen.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for their own use, for example, but many of the stolen wheels end up being sold, for example, via the internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not come to know that stolen wheels would hardly go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, because he may be guilty of a crime or a breach of hiding.
"The alarm rings should ring if a good-looking bike is sold clearly down," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nops during his working day to the protectors of the Kallion Library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces of wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says Hirvi. "He's never been stolen, he's been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to the thieves, there's not necessarily a hipster value here," says Hirvi of Helsinki.
In the Helsinki Rock kiosk, Siiri Valve quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike humiliated the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into some fixed, like a wheelbar.
"There will be a lot of thinking about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the student of Helsinki about his white bike, which alone the helmet paid about five hundred euros.
"Every time you hear from the guys that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad spins, such swamp-jops."
A bike was stolen from the house company's indoor yard a year ago.
The bike, though, had not been locked, so Valve could wait for it.
Less than 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is testing peer jury members from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
At first, the experiment applies to children under 15 years of age who now have no criminal liability.
The jury is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that a peer jury discusses the crime with the offender and sets a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime may join the peer jury himself to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"Everyone is directed more responsibly towards young people's activities so that not everything would ruin the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not have to face the adult panel but reflects what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The experienced service training agency Palmu serviceformator Iikka Lovio reports that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
"It has been a message that you continue on the road you choose," Lovio says.
The versatile jury is part of the Immigrant Young Helsinki project, which is behind the Helsinki City and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those needed, not just to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican impresses want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The U.S. newspaper Politico, which had gotten it to see the draft, newsed the letter.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and récord dissent, threaten to bring a voice belt to these democratic elections," says Politico.
Only directing all potential funds to Congress can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are falling day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent over the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not in support of anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump who are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they do not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. child families
In the United States, President-in-Office of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, explained the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president in order for the economy to go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the centre of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of wealthy people, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-help for the American duunars who suffer from the shift of factories to the countries of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're the builder people, we have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working child families.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay a tax on departure, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"[President] I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton, Clinton was going to criticize the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "coupled only millions of people like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's pork hole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businessman himself.
He reminded the listeners of the small-scales whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton snitched.
These are the Rio viewers: Kisats have not glued to Finnish screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports races are seen in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached the peaks of viewers.
On one occasion, the races have been glued to the top of the screens at 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Upper Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the sake of comparison: a month ago, the E.M.S. competitions received almost 800 000 viewers at the TV2 level, and the soccer EM competitions were just another million.
For the time being, the Olympics have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel.
The top sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the viewers' numbers, and reminds us that the viewers are first divided into the Rio Olympics for several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the television viewers choose the Olympics as a whole.
Even on the TV side, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contests to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20 000 viewers all the time from 500 000 to 500 000, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large proportion of the Rio races comes at night in Finland.
Another reason for a diminution of interest - if someone thinks it is now a diminution - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the beginning, the interest would have popped up with it.
In addition, general sports are only beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
The original numbers of viewers have been close to what was expected.
When the general sport starts, the viewers' numbers explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first days of the races at Apple's App Store to be the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150 000 times.
I'd bet we're already going on 200,000 loads.
"We'll only get network viewers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena hasn't worked with all the users, I hope.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems at the start of the phase.
Updated versions of the applications should be corrected.
The Rio Olympics will be displayed on Yle's channels and arena more extensively than any other sport ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be seen both on the High and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving trainer Matti Kannela found a 20 - square - square - foot grasp at the crossroads where the bottom of the diving computer appeared to be 104 meters.
In June 2014, Finland's environmental centre tried to strengthen the observation by relying on the sound.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So to date, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvaswater (90 meters).
More than 80 meters extend to Saimaa, Toissi and the Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Days.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
This is how your Day will not reach the ten deepest, and Suvaswater is farther away from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Last corrected paragraph where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Adventurous tax on pensioners: Taxation on pensioners is still more pressing
The taxation of pensioners is still more pressing than the wage earners.
The admirer says that the misconduct was raised under the parliamentary elections and pensioners' taxation was promised to be equal with the wage earners.
This is not included in the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be.
The promises given should be kept up after the election, he tells the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in labour income which reduced taxation.
The matter was warmed up by representatives of the opposition in the Parliament, who had squeezed Alexander Stubbi (Code) on the elections.
Purchase power is secured, it doesn't grow
In the line presented by Mr Petteri Orpo, Minister of Finance, the tax reductions are, according to Ihala, mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing wages, since next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that tax reductions will positively affect purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The admirer welcomes the desire of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo to respect the competitive agreement that has been made hard.
He says keeping the contract is important for credibility.
This is the most important economic and employment policy action in the period of government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It is necessary because the economy is so much at the expense of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Infected with prolonged unemployment
The admirer appeals to the government to engage in long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were some 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate will run from 72% to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish sacrifices are known in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed in bombings in Finland.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish people to be vigilant in Finland and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finnish tourists who intend to withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In Thailand, very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish Thai travel season is scheduled for the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand through Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target, in particular, the Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are now out of town.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
Westphalen says there's no information yet on the attacker.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political restlessness of the divided society in Thailand and to the constitution of the military constituency of last week's referendum.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
He says the Queen's birthday and mother's day are celebrated in the city.
Transportation in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the passage of the day so that the authorities are extremely accurate about safety.
Thai Police: Not International Terrorism · Global Voices
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, reports the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the favourite tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland's popular tourist destination, the holiday in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death sacrifices.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
At the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, there have been four bombs blown up yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is transported by Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is not known
According to the leader of the Thai military train, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the attacker is not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more, he told journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the authors were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Thai people to withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the instructions of the great broadcaster for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims that took place during the night of Finland.
Last night's strike in Hua Hin has made it possible to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were injured in the last strike of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the known clock tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where they think they found another bomb.
Sulat Than's bomb, according to the governor of the county, was hidden in a flower bench.
In the attack, a municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America's Biles won women's fourfolding
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second in 60.098 and Russian Aliia Mustafina was third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still in Rio's competitions with the championships on the permanent, jumping and busts.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics in a sense of mind over the past few years.
From three previous years, he had eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of the Qualitation and Permation three times in a row, both in the last and the second years.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two world championships in the team.
You know, Biles has more MM-medals, and he's got jumps and bushes.
Thai Finnish Entrepreneur: "The strike has no impact on tourism"
The Thai Phuket real estate agency and the children's play club in the same property Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, evaluated as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, Huovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of Thai tragedies.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bombing attack in Bangkok.
If these former tourists haven't deported, this is hardly the case.
The office of the hotel is located a few hundred metres from the explosive site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called for about 9 local times and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the coastline and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the roadblocks were made for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 p.m.
On the beach, many people hadn't even heard about the strikes.
In the middle of three days in Thailand, the traffic in Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the scene, the explosion has been pretty small, Huovila said at the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruneupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol detected two men that fit the characters, hiding in the close six.
Another man was caught right away.
One escaped, but later a man was found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of the use of a motor vehicle, theft, and gross damage.
The police thank those who gave the tips.
Director of Research on Russia's Leadership Changes: Clear Removal
In Russia, on Friday, the highest leadership change took place for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-faithed 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's a former diplomat, and he was a second man of Ivanov.
The fabric burst says that the cause of Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling management functions is one way of power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating independent power to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved with other managers or screwed up.
Fall of station in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, is moving to special tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On the footage of the state media, Putin said that he was a joint decision.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution instead, Russia Today said.
The kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view this is a clear fall in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia's power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
An older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi, from the Foreign Political Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is that Putin switches to his neighbor's district.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human plate when they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human plate when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is the representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 per cent of the important city of Manbiji for the Fathers last week.
However, it is estimated that tens of Yihadites remained in the city at that time.
Corrected earlier news at 19:30: Previously, we mistakenly told that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Internal Affairs documentary policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's approach to publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian says to STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior had previously refused to hand over a list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister substantiated the decision on the basis of the Council's instructions and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting record.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic Show starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the titles.
From the beginning of the season, he was offended by his back path and had to skip Jamaica's Olympics.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and that's a key issue, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-dressed sambatans and fan-made journalists.
Around Porina Bolt underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the time when the general sport has struggled with the interest of doping scandals and blooming.
The previous defeat of Bolt in the Olympic Games came in Athens 2004, when he was cut off in the early 200 meters of time in 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose practice.
Four years later, in Beijing, his kingdom began with a hundred meters of destruction of the world record and self - confidence of competitors in spite of the final feast of 9,69.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin's MM contests, Bolt reached his career at a time of law.
The world records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 and 19.19.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of drops, but no one but Bolt himself believes in its birth.
In 100, Bolt's very challenger is the 100-Olympian of Athens 2004 Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American in only one hundred and a half seconds.
Bolt hasn't lost in the final of the prizes since his reign in Beijing, even if he's only made it.
In Daegu 2011 a hundred MM finals left Bolt out of running because of fraud.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal line for the career, Bolt, has set up next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exposures from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping crime
According to the Chinese State News Office Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runners and Silvia Danekova are also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was transferred home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
He settled in Rio for the fourth in a woman's 100-metre butterfly bath.
According to Brazil's newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case before the CAS International Appeal Court for Sports.
Xinhua reports that the sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reported that Bulgarian female steward Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has passed from Rio to the home of a sports coach because of the doping rike.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had been performed as an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is a Kenyan Quick Running Coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using a 800-metre runner of Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping any phelps. Historical gold came into the showstyle.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in the 200-metre mixing of his 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the same species' Olympics in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was placed in second mixing before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic Cuisine Commander Helen Skelton is laughing at the evening interview.
The case of Helen Skelton on Monday is most read on the website of this week's evening magazine.
At the address of the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if some or the British press has a small hunch of his revealing and special outfits.
TV's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton is dressed in high-interest shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealability - at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little bouquets are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be shocked, and maybe he's embarrassed, but he's stressing that he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here looking at sports, and the focus has to be in sportsmen.
It shouldn't matter how badly I dress.
Can you imagine that the bulb has come all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do, is okay to me, Skelton's cheering up.
You know what?
It's hard of nothing if it comes from dressing (the runner).
I'm a little fun if this has hit someone's radar.

The dam of Argentina smashed the Traitor-Siren, and the Finn was thinking about protest.
Wind Traitor-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Sire's traitor had a hard time Thursday.
Argentinian dam sprinkled the Tuuli Traitor-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and others ran away, said Finland's main coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete was thinking about protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been in vain under the Olympics rules.
I should have dropped into the water so I could have been reimbursed, said the Traitor-Siren.
The Finn was hanging on his plate until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish man was left with the crash on his way to 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic optimist in London is the eighth.
As far as the head was concerned, the crash didn't have much to do with it.
Friday is an important day for the race to leave 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, the Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 special issues that, according to science, extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proved to bring additional years to the person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the person's health so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that can't be influenced by a person themselves can bring him further years.
These include, inter alia, a tendency to moderate body fattyness or social status.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
You don't always have to get a bump. Just get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the ‘reduced risk of death', especially with regard to neurological or heart disease.
Once again, on behalf of alcohol, studies suggest that reasonable use of one to three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong the person's life for up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents dysfunctions.
On the other hand, they can promote the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be more arrogant after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection from sexual illness is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it's not enough to have sex as a matter of fact.
In order for a person to get more years of his life, he must also get orgasm.
Mobility will bring more years, it will not be denied.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute loneliness.
One study at the University of Oxford found that women with large butt levels of cholesterol were lower.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these aspects to lower mortality.
It was then an athlete who got to the Olympic medalists or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bottle.
A lot of research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life more years.
On the other hand, some researchers doubt that a long age is the result of a person's social status - which, for its part, will allow the pursuit of such confessions as the Nobel Prize for example.
A study on the use of purchases by persons over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily is likely to be less likely to be a parent who buys.
This is due to a reduction in loneliness in specific trades.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
The Umpiman's drunkard fell down on the truck.
On Friday night, in Finland, a serious cholera of trucks and passenger cars took place.
The accident occurred at Koske, mid - Friday at 9:00.
The truck had been driving in Forssa's direction, when the passenger car was driven on the same track, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the crash, the truck went up, but it burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire itself.
The passenger car crashed on the road, and then it went over the road to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who transported a passenger car left her car under pressure.
The rescue facility removed an injured driver from the car and was transported to the University of Turku Central Hospital.
The result of a woman's blow test was 2,02 prom.
He's being suspected of a rude rider.
Post sent candy to the wrong city.
There were shortcomings in the salon K-Citymarket range because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to the Wall River.
Teija Halt, who lives in the parsley, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit his eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in irradiation because Post delivered our cargo to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post is delivered!
So if you don't move in the lawn, then the sign reads.
The zombie sign of the merchant relates to the fact that Post expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting.
The weed cut is on the Post's offer until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and she decided to share it in social media.
I was awkwardly beaten by the popularity of the update.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in the candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of transport services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that from five stages three were distracted to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to the three sub-transmissions (Saloon), but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first thing I've heard about tonight.
Laija Halt didn't get indignated by the sign because she found all her own sweet potato favourites in the selection.
Different weight loss! 30 pounds lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of his change

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
The composer, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss work in 2009.
He's a total lifestyle change, and he's slipped a little quietly for 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund published his performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years.
Backlund's pre- and post-photo pair has collected a number of thankful remarks from the weight losers.
You're great.
At the same time, there's a lot of motivation!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I'll get you a lot of power and enthusiasm when you're on the same path of heaven, the other one tells you.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds. Let's do it with the project now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, to which he was traveling ten kilos.
In three months of fitness, five pounds were finally dropped.
Wish of a woman's family in Loviisa: the memory of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and adresses by donating for the work of police dogs.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that gives the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoon's Veterinary Station as a substitute and also performed his nursing practice there.
Veterinary office remembers with words touching a woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and unfearing work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of security services.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa Kosken village.
The woman's neighbors have told the evening magazine that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection.
There was a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of First Instance ruled on Post on the infringement of the Equal Opportunity Act
Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused to attend the training, evaluated Kanta-Hämee's court of appeal in his judgment.
The Court of First Instance ordered Post to pay the majority of the wages held to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Post could have arrested only a part of the teacher's salary, which corresponds to the share of learning throughout the day's work.
In the light of its trade union activities, an employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position, contrary to the Equal Opportunity Act.
The Union for Postal and Logistics had been compliant with the decision of the PAU organisation on the prohibition of access to information.
During last year's post office in November, PAU made a decision that Post's employees do not know the rent workers who broke the strike.
First, the news of the people.
Turkey's return to a path respecting human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concern about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of press freedom and freedom of speech.
Putin dismissed the chief of his administration... instead of the Estonian-speaking Persecution.
President Vladimir Putin has dismissed President Sergei Ivanov, Kreml says.
There will be a communist director of the Council and Estonia, Karl Vaino's son-in-law, Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, reports Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of government.
According to the Kremlin Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, is moving to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution instead, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on KGB spying.
Many saw Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to serve in 2011 before Putin was re-elected as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant purchase for a ban on the game... not to be seen at the opening of the Valioligue.
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioligue is kicked out on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed in England.
Manchester United's giant procurement Paul Pogba is on the side of the ban when ManU opened his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian Society of Pogbasta 105 million euros.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, because Pogballe remained a burden on Juvena.
He got two warnings last season in the Italian cups, and it's going to become one game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next league to play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, great madness is a virtue.
Accurate criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival's position internationally appreciated as an event aimed at the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
The festivities have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
One of the main stage artists is Punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is stacked, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have just a headboard and a beer, says the artistic leader of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival held in Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small square festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background of success is a simple question: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
Event production is quite abnormal to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act according to authority orders, says the event's artistic leader Tuomas Kallio.
She knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out this year too.
The aim has been to raise the number of people in the last 70 000 years to 5 000.
Even this year, the festivals will see a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things have to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle, which is controlled by huge pathways.
That's what we don't want.
During 13 years, the success of the event has been soaked that 130 exhibits, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars are partly made of artificial grass.
In addition to the main layer and smaller stages, 15 000 tents of people are located this year.
The rock admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazier, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it's lost, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the rock is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, activities in the middle of the 2000s were very dependent on the Helsinki City's approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow-driven shareholding company was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to make "grey things" like building that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First of all, we want to distinguish ourselves with content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit in with the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punkin legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan of his own kind, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rap and soul-combining festivals have the most typical performer.
Kallion says Iggy was bucketed because now is probably the last time this is seen at the show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good jobs in the last few years.
The bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flower boxes. The tourists fled in their horrors.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the flower couch and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumra according to CNN.
From 1989 onwards, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look right, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded at Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, the Finnishs, too, on Phuket Island, exploded two bombs.
No one knows he's dead.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at Hua Hin knowingly at least one bomb that hadn't yet had time to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebellious forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also involve criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been contagious with the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new preparedness forces starts in a war situation first.
In an acute wartime situation, armed men will only be commanded to combat tasks after several months of the oath of the military, says the Middle Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, the warfare chief of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, five and a half months of armed men serving at war are only those who are at the end of their training.
According to the Director of Training, the service is first provided for reserves from the preparedness teams.
One shipowner or reserver is not commanded to be assigned to a task that has not been provided with the required training, Sonninen says.
Previously in the summer, the Defence Forces began to train shipowners in immediate capacity units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during training of shipowners.
Pamela Tola got huge compensation from the house.
Actress Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of a two-story separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trade, however, there was a serious humidity problem in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, thus accruing economic losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and court.
The Court of Justice delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It retained the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the salesman will have to compensate for the costs of the couple's trial and investigation totalling EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was slightly due to the fact that some of the needs to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers at the time of the mortgage sale.
However, the apparent errors in construction were essentially more serious in court than had been stated.
Tola was looking for a good-looking home.
At court, Tola reported that the couple had specifically sought a good house because they did not want to go to repairs.
He was given the impression that the building has been repaired and in good condition and that there is no harm to the aspects mentioned in the fitness review report.
The fitness audit report mentioned as risks and malfunctions in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water over the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not apparent that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained in the sense that rainfall coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a bit within a few years.
The transaction was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, wetness problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed that the building was microbial, which the Witnesses said was due both to rainfall and to the rise of the rock.
On the west side, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's estimate, also be reached through the porch indoors.
The health risk-free, limit-bound mould or yacht was found in the hospice samples in the home care room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window box and in the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended against the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware before trading of the decision of the city of Espoo that anti-authorised changes had been made to the dwelling.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were at the heart of the court.
According to court, the buyers were able to assume, on the basis of the information they received from the seller prior to trading, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measures of repair in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not believe that there was a particular reason to carry out a more comprehensive audit.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to take a decision, the Court of Justice declares in its judgment.
Scary archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - also in the Finnish register
In a recent article of Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how documents stored in microfilms in the National Archive in Maryland of the United States, covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaids.
Documents and registration cards are derived from a breeding agency in Nazi Germany.
The Roots Agency was under the responsibility of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been studied by a SS doctor.
The same applies to even more women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynecological studies were conducted for women to find out.
The Race Agency investigated women's history, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female tree.
Women also needed to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency handwritten lifetimes and good recommendations from close ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "loving for children", "savings", and "good national Socialists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders set up a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside of marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports from the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother's honorary cross was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Areans" and "No-Areans" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages are stated.
On the sixth day of Sire's traitor, Nirko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed third on the first day of Finnjolli's sailing at the Rio Olympics, but the whole crowd remained the top of the sailing at the second day's departure.
In the overall situation, he rose to the eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to the 14th place.
Wind Traitor-Siren fought for RS:X class day leaving places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the Traitor-Siren is on the sixth.
In 470, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren left the opening day for 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in place of 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep, "I was so in the canvas."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship bartender to tangokuninkaa in 1995, the best sold solo artist in Finland, and the star of dancers and festivals, Sillanpää is still squeezing, and he is currently on the rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppisen, was published on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The Sillanhead's career rose to a real rise in his victory on the Tangokunnian Krono on the Tango River market in 1995.
In the race Sillanhead sang tangoes, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Silanpää, at the request of a man, which Kassu Halone agreed to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanhead sang it on the tape in a terrible crack and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canvas!
The bridge head is remembering in the book.
I mean, it's not exactly what I'm saying. It's just that it's been sung in a crack.
Even though I wasn't physically the best, it was still good.
I learnt that all the time you don't have to demand perfect and perfect.
Another coincidence related to the most popular songs of a man, which is reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his then partner and finally ended up with the texts of the Gold Paper, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sara Törmäs were not the ones that Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanhead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of a separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the seven - day news.
In the news of the paper, Jari and the former lover were told that Jari was overly celebrating and drinking, but Jari said it was full of shit and it wasn't true.
Jari called the book in his anger to the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week's polls predicted the opposite result.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of the EU's stay.
No valued research institute or university ticketed for the divorce, although a few individual scientists were able to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western policy, the theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Kiharaki
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey of the profession, responds to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on a non-economic basis.
One explanation for the loss of economic status by economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of working people, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British away.
Many also have the view that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the view of the Economist, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently raised.
They were particularly shocked by the balance of the BBC, which provided only a couple of % of EU economists who were in favour of the disparity than the overwhelming majority.
The EU's angry press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other combinations of economic strengths have to say about the consequences of the differences.
These far-reaching combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as the Economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Migration is also an economy.
The overpowered argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant moves your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafeteria has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get time for doctors if they weren't?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the real British get a school place if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists did not succeed in explaining that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.

One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up the A and B plans.
A few weeks before the vote, a few more weeks before the vote, the victory of the EU-supporting camp, namely, a plan for B, in the event that the result would be a leave, was set aside.
The concern was that investors started pulling their assets out of the market.
The real estate funds normally do not have large liquid funds, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the funds' investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of the only open day of Aberdeen's real estate fund that the news touched.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all British real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Thus, the real estate funds reserved Brexit for a very different strategy.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-supported camp won, Europe went messed up.
However, the few weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Oldanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, Director-General of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their commerce.
These together robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Oldanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after it had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its commerce for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it was quite even, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, says Oldanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner European Funds have had no similar impact.
There were, however, a lot of questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
Old people feel that closures of real estate funds have received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds covered by closures dominate around 4% of British property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds to half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not look "greater" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, says Vanhane.
Price and dollar rates are weaker for 30 years, plus 15 % discount sales on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The Dollar can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Oldanen.
Brexit brought mines to the London Real Estate Market
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look so big yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in Aberdee Asset Management, of the British Real Estate Fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
There's a strong voice in it.
I realized this is going to the side of Plan B now, old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
At the office, television screens normally forbidden to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came in front of the camera to tell about his divorce this morning.
When the market opened, the screen ends just looked red.
It was a morning that he would never have believed to live, says Oldanen.
It is not because, despite the myllerrhea, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was somewhat calm, says Oldanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The net collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market started to anticipate heavy invoices on the British real estate market, and in particular on the London real estate market.
Up to 20% reductions were projected in London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their commerce one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the myrrh has fallen, but in the air there's still a bit of uncertainty.
It does not, however, appear to be the last summer holidays this week on the face of the Old One in Helsinki.
He thinks it's still too early to say a lot about what Brexit has to do with it.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been reported first.
CBRE's information on price developments in the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all London property prices fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the decrease, Oldanen lists.
The numbers aren't that terrible, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly index was published in 1987, and there have been fewer figures in only five months, says Vanhanen.
All similar drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is therefore interesting that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the US real estate market to the global economic crisis.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite a hit, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now not seen such panic sales as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You can also find money as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
As a matter of fact, the price-repair movement is not a miracle to him... that could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other world-class cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Oldanen.
So the fall started really high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, the old man's list.
The British economy has grown sharply, and the London population has also grown.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that globalizes, says Oldanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players on the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as the city's easy target.
In addition, low interest rates have been feeding, for example, pension companies have been forced to seek profits from new targets.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to Oldase, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises stabilized last summer, Oldanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his ownership in London, and he was a net salesman last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Oldanen.
He doesn't dare evaluate much, but he says that there's hardly a chance of getting up.
The sensation suggests that there is a downward or steady going ahead.
The old man has already seen more moves up and down because he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks he's gonna get out of the hole with a job.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Oldanen.
The S group begins to register shopping data in more detail than before
Soon the S group knows what you eat, because today the trading group told me that it was starting to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its customers.
Up to now, when the receipt has been collected from the final amount, the group will start to grasp the receipt from the products purchased as well in early May.
The S group is coming after Kesko, because the information on goods purchased by plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala's feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used for marketing authorisation.
The most efficient channel is an e-mail.
A very few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to the Economic Statements.
He said that Kesko would not react to the change in registration of the S group.
Kesko already ranks his parent client in ten groups, according to just food purchases.
Classification is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
Collaborative partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their knowledge.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-up client program and does not have such plans in this section.
Finland's Lähi-Commerce has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer programme, which may be associated with Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and on the day, as well as the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K group or the S group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He believes that the post-Customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but it will be discussed later.
However, Ora does not authorise the registration of product data.
First experiment
So far SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data have included vocational training, housing, child births and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Priority cards is deposited with the purchase date and time, place, purchase amount and payment method.
In addition, S-bonus partners have received information from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at product level will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, the data in the S markets, Prisms, Home Terror and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, CEO of SOK's customer owner and partner activities.
The S team says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, data are stored in bags anyway, wanted it or not.
If you want to check your deposited information on the S-group website.
For example, the cashier can't access the information, underlines Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Custom's newest dog reinforcement - the puppy will become the first explosive dog
The black labrador-outdoor puppy snorts vigorously five similar country boxes at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It won't take long when it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, she was exposed to a jar of flavouring shells.
Rut gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first specialised dog in Tull's search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa airport next year.
The task may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heiland because the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks that have taken place in Europe.
The Paris-Brussels strikes caused customs measures and, after the strikes, surveillance has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
The second is access to training for a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is the posting via Helsinki-Vanta.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments per annum, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad, can be carried out by the airport.
In recent years, at Helsinki-Vanta airport, the customs office has made some 300 searches for the purchases of online shops, the baggage and air cargo of passenger aircraft, arms parts, ammunition and explosives and their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail shipments.
In ports there will be a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and identify areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of weapons and explosive dogs will be carried out in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
School at the Church Nun
The training of a heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull dog school in the church nume.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the defence forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smell Heila will be taught to identify.
"Hello will always be further trained as necessary," says Grönberg.
Hila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six narcotics dogs and the money and drug dogs Massi.
The Labrador Beaver Heila has been selected from a 10-dog puppy kid.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include a scrapping and a hunting kit, as well as a calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntion, is a close colleague for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nowhere without Heila going home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from a single lake.
The cameraman of the Night-Sayman will lose the camera's mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy to the cover immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
I'll finish my initial education next year.
There are further level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for the required tasks.
Hilan can see work at Helsinki-Vantaa next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travelers can't come to silencing the workbooks of the dog on, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten years after which they retire.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work rates last only from ten minutes to two hours.
It's a tough competition in Customs to own working dogs.
The owner of Heila applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion who hasn't had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties in Customs.
The Mini State received its first Olympic medal. The people get a day off.
The Olympic Gold of less than a million inhabitants in Fiji in Rugby is so highly appreciated in the country that the government has ordered the 22nd of August as a national day off.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed this after the championship was solved.
The Free Day will be held the next day for the team's return.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fidž rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the land was followed by the finals in the capital of Suva, where the stadium was set up with a screen.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish buyer fainted after a great performance
Milko Tokola, a pressurator, succeeded in his last attempt at 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the heavy lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola got 175 pounds of push and 145 pounds of trick.
His co-result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push for 175 pounds, as was the case with each other.
In the third attempt, the weights increased as a result of the fierce screaming.
The body trembled under weight until the court approved the lift.
The pleasure of the Finnish buyer was the fact that he has suffered from the problems of his knees.
RoPS got a viral attacker Prosan - Veicker League - Night-Sanomas
The Rovaniemen Palloseura, a man's football team, has concluded a season-long agreement with the official attacker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a leader in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovanieme is small.
We went through more than 10 players with an agent through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small crowd began to be separated as a good option for Prosa, the RoPS coach Juha Malinen told us in the press.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the Talinnian Flora, where he made 109 matches total 51 goals.
He has also played in the Estonian Land Team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinä River where the Rovaniemen will meet the SJK of the master of dominating Finland.
RoPS was needed for the new attacker when the last season's goal King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star will rise again: Teen Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a nice acquaintance of the modern family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, is once again bursts by presenting a threat to his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minihorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also this butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently drawn attention by changing his style and behavior to a much more courageous one.
The star has possessed images published in social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to be dressed in very narrow outfits.
Winter, at the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood change" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it looks to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen innumerable times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignated some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to figure out where he'll be in ten years when the lower hill is already so hard, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans instead defend the actress and ask not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to many women, you're an inspiring young woman.
Japanese people prefer to be attracted from the Nordic countries to Finland: In autumn it is possible to see a saturated mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start out of early autumn, Visit Finland reports in the press.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese arrondissement tours.
Revonfires are our winter trip cards, and they are strongly linked to the heart tale and the snowy landscapes.
In the winter of the Lapland, there's a lot of demand, but now we're trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the arrondissement starts early in autumn and goes on to a long spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the arrondissement by making a vision two times saturated, reports in the newsletter Visit Finland v. Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland's main target groups are rich 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and Lind said that this revontul has enormous potential.
The nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed over twice as much in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to be satisfied with silver in the rugby-7 race when Fidz's champion team won gold.
The impressive success of the UK in the seven rugby contest broke out in a crushing way when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the final chapters 43-7 played at the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fidzi taught the masters how to handle balls, moves, side-threatenings, support games, runs and brutality, and thus won gold — if it was the first Olympic medal in its history.
The death was silver, which was a little more slim comfort to Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They may be proud of their success as Olympic species in the first rugby-7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A sharp victory from South African Boks in the semi-final chapters 7 to 5 earlier on the same day could negatively affect the team in the finals.
In spite of this, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British even though the 15-year-old team had been in full power.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal tomorrow: Fidz's main coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's training, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
It hurts, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi began excellently and presented his tactical skills to Britain as a result of fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had hit a bunch of mobile buses, and world champions got up to 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner of the crash.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai made another goal on the right side of the paintpot.
The situation was 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tackling prevented Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it did not slow Fidz's way in long.
After the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made a goal in the right corner, after which Britain was 17 to 0 at a loss.
Nakarawa made another goal for the continuation of the first half of the game, when there was more than a minute left.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouvu stumbled through the British team's ever more powerless strikes and stumbled over the finish line.
The opening period after the landing was completed was 29–0.
It seemed that the Fidzians were born to play seven players' rugbys, while the British are still in the species of the student boy.
Which is very true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in the mid-term and managed to hold the entire Fidzians for four minutes, which compared to the first half of the time was a good performance until Josua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent Fidzian team game.
Dan Norton succeeded in reducing the situation to 36 to 7 by making Britain a paint at the left corner, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans in the viewhouse sang, flung tickets and danced.
Fidz's purely joyful attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made a final trip to the cake of the Fidzians by making a paint in the last few moments.
Pilli rings, the Fidzians hugged each other and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won in Japan's semi-final chapters 20 to 5 and Britain had swayed over South Africa in a tight semi-final where the balance was resolved by the British goal outbreak.
Kyle Brown took the Boxes of South Africa to the lead in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the line with his stunning footwork and stumbled under the paints in the second half of the time.
Marcus Watson, who is an English 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson's brother, sealed the victory and finally the silver star.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to tap gold.
The most emotional of this could not be gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning played 220 winning bets in history and found additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the hallways, the third coach Robin Williams voice in the boat was echoed, encouraging them to their second consecutive Olympics in women's twofold. This makes them the first women in British sport history to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two great athletes connecting on the water surface like rivers of age, does not fully match the character of success.
There is a large number of helping hands behind each corner, each contributing to two-fold achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who then did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had urinary clot cancer, and I was able to cut the tumor off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way it is."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside the seasonal period of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if this is the case now in such circumstances that it can even be said.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
It's already a journey to rest in itself, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent the nervous morning and spoke a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Firearms Regime, who was behind the tour of Afghanistan, says: "I've been at the sensation level this week in ruins, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen's and Robin's box have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't behin', so incredibly great thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
Two have found an overpowered rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 metres when the two New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very close in a moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important that you do not drive away from the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't pursue the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good coin and win the race we did."
Two will think about a year before he decides on his future.
Glover's celebrating next month with Steve Backshalli on TV's nature programmes.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland exchanges Panama's leaked government
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which the protesters who have been ravaged by Panama's information leaks are already demanding in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it did not suffice for demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last summer affects the outcome of the autumn election.
In June, the President's elections clearly showed criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected as an outsider of politics, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Father.
The U.S. President's candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest talks.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization of Isi and the democratic leader of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry about the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton, your tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the popular use of a burkini bathing suit in the bathing areas of the Muslims, among other things, says the Britishtile Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a swimwear that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which greatly expresses religious ties, can increase the risk of disturbances in France, which has been subjected to terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations of men connected to the Father attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the siege - Pykkösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue sealing has been detected on the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the region of Oulu took water samples from the nine EU coasts in the region of Oulu and from 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the seaside of all bathing areas, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria were below the limits laid down by the Ministry of Social and Health regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococci in the seaweed bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue swam detected on the lake's bathing area does not yet make the water unsuitable, but under favourable circumstances the situation may quickly become blue-swam flowers, making the surface of the water a blue-swam mass in layers.
The environmental action will be monitored by dense checks.
If the blue flavour becomes a blue flavour, it will also be reported separately on the bathing area notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 % of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a generation exchange of gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational exchanges of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forestry and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the net income of the forestry.
Over and above, the idea of making such a tool to promote the exchange of generations of forests is good, commented on by Juha Hakkarainen, Director of the Central Forestry Union (MTK) of Agriculture and Forestry Producers.
However, Hakkarainen finds a critical tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts is proposed for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
MTK and Hakkarainen considered that the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could result directly from the sale of wood.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry to prevent a loss of the income of the forestry from being deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would have a tax advantage even if he didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is innecessarily complicated.
The average hunter owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that the model applies to only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, he said it would cut off 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction circuit.
The mall would have an impact on about 10% of the forestry company, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, the forest reduction has been taken for decades by Hakkarainen.
Its background is the ageing of the forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.
A strong raven surprised the car drivers in Himanga... two cars crashed into the track and ran into each other.
There was a special after-job in Himang on Friday morning.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive cars fell into the dock, after which the back of the car hit the dock ahead of the time.
According to Harri Pyyhti, the day-to-day firemaster is suspected to have been caused by a strong raging deafness.
In the back of the car there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more information about their injuries.
The driver of the car didn't get hurt before the time.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himang a few kilometers to the Kala River.
Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy
Recent research results from Turku University researchers can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the quality of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer-round tissue to correspond to normal soft tissue.
The effectiveness of cancer therapy in the future may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells in addition to cancer cells and surrounding tissue.
The results of the studies have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family murder continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
In the case of both convicted persons, the wooding of the family home killing continues in court.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home in Moscow.
One received 8 years of four months, including as a young person, of killing and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the death was also sentenced to threaten the safety of traffic as a young person and to transport the vehicle without rights as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence were complained of the verdict.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser punishment of a man sentenced for murder as a young person to 12 years' imprisonment.
They were in a perfect understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, 17 - year - old youths killed a school home as the director of a child protection unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old man who was sentenced to murder, according to the reasoning, attacked a pilot sitting in the living room on the couch.
The guide had gotten out of his grip and put a young man in his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The driver was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among others.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from a family home at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the longest spinal cord of the world, growing only at the age of 156
The longest alive spine in the world has been secured by the ice shark, reports a study published in the Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, i.e. the hollow can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
Ice shark's life is added to the fact that it grows only a centimeter a year.
Only one mollusc species is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age on a radio coal drive.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the age of the elder, it was estimated that 392 years, although throwing in the direction of the elder could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - The News of the People
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues from the state would not be received if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was made.
Tax revenues would also be reduced in particular through the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount to be missed, $1 billion a year.
The high rate of income tax is now 39.6 after Trump's reduction 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the state of overregulation in business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The final environmental standards of the scaffolds must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be discarded.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be retrieved.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is, according to Trump, the main reasons for the problems of the United States.
The free trade agreements would be dismissed.
Imports from the PRC would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our confession, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to unite cities, American ships to oversee seas, American steel to raise new clouds across the country.
In spite of its objective, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - also those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday in Finland.
A wave of raids from the past - The News of the People
The sea mills fatally, but the real wave of attack hits in the middle of the streets of Madrid - the accounting with the past can begin.
It summarized the core of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Matkarakastajat (2013) was a small fun and rustic satirian comedy, the predecessive skin in which I live (2011) the top of the Spanish tutorial career.
At the same time, Julie (2016) is placed somewhere between those two works.
It's a reconciled, semi-sexual love, human relationship, and family drama, the center of which is the relationship between mother and daughter.
It's a simple story, and we'll see it a lot long backwards.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be marvelous all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the daughter's birth, from the times when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, a TV-tweet from the Ommelte series (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be regarded as a thorn, but I would say that it is rather sleek and wordly with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance between such a distinctive glimpse of ability and humour in Julieta.
It is equally played, restrained, a place that contains good music and a rather sad film with such materials in its elegance.
On the other hand, the typical visual colouring capacity for the Spanish guide is stored and so that it begins to inject a little quietly into the eye more as a pure form than as a functioning dramatic means of efficiency.
Diseases, deaths, or only sudden loss of the film, are the subject of the film, but the surface remains as korean.
This applies in particular to dressing: in the case of a name person, you live from scene to scene, and the same applies to the earrings shown.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main issue, that is, the signs of the seizure, is not particularly improving.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made a manuscript based on three novels awarded by the Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel 2013.
The Novels have been published in the book "Farkulainen: Reports".
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly even written literature filming.
There would have been emotionally unreasonable material for more vigorous drama, its large amount of things - especially the blazing guilt - theme of the movie.
Guidance and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government tries to win elections - The News of the People
No new surgery will be done, saying ministers, so that the basic Finns will not be completely collapsed.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in the shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided savings of four billion will suffice.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Code) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal because the cuts in social security were already decided on in the spring framework.
Children's allowances, pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the benefits-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
♪ The kings haunt ♪
Why do ministers stress so hard that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipalities will be held in April and are the most important fever meter in the election season, not the gallups.
Even before, it has been seen that the municipal outcome of government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the gallops tell us that the government party of Finland expects a slack leap, although the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the parliamentary elections of 12.3 per cent.
The fundamental Finns received 752 new councillors four years ago, most of whom will be paid the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life line of the government of three or so great parties is in the hands of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters of the parties have had enough government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's group's presence have also come to the surface.
First of all, the new surgeries will not come, and the fact that next year they will be done hard and secondly, they will try to soften up the fundamental Finnish strike.
Big surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still up.
The government has set the goal of debiting over this parliamentary period, but next year's budget proposal for Petter Orpo will be indebted to EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not broken down or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means further further cuts on the previous ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be built close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring it will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
The indebtedness of these activities
It is quite clear that in the current actions the debt will not fall, although Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen in the consciousness of the budget prove it inadvertently:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. appeal from the international economy will not become.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy that took place at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been extended by an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now pays EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current general government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery of the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice entirely by taking up a new debt.
This is the idea of the centre, the assembly and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: The Municipality Wants to Leave a Lot of Missions
Three out of four believes that the organization of day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the province is more clearly sought by rural development, specialised health care, vocational education, vocational universities and institutional care for the disabled.
There is no wish to transfer any of the tasks under municipal responsibility to the State.
A low-age rider was running after-drive to get the police out of here.
Joensuu, a 16-year-old biker, drove a police squad away in Joensuu in Ilomansuu on Friday night at half a time.

The ingredients of great inaccuracy in the air... see the parafiscal gallery of the parafiscal destruction.
The crash flow of parafest tents caused massive destruction.
The president of the Joensuun Parafest Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will reach its economical feet and that the event will also be organised next year.
The last actress of the Parafest, Kalle Salone, appeared at the end of Friday night on the Thursday stage.
On Saturday, the program will continue with shows held at the city theatre premises starting at 13:00.
The Art Center in Ahjo is a Parafest Exhibition at 13-15.
The programme is planned.
The crash flow occurs on the cloud when the rainwater and its weight starts the dropping air flow.
Changes in the shape of the cloud water bind the heat, and therefore the lower air mass cools and its speed towards the earth is accelerating.
The Institute of Air Science reports that there are several flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of crash flows.
The crash flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu art museum at Parafest's event site on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly injured.
There was a child in the crowd, who was slightly injured in further care.
Air pollution ages in London
According to the study, London's skin grows faster than usual.
The cause of the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
Evening Standard is a report of the British investigation.
British skin care company Caci analyzes London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the elderly in rural areas.
Small particles that olden the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory disorders, which, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass the outermost layer of the skin.
Caci's study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for the Londons who travel on their way to work in the vicinity of congestion streets.
People in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.

Josban, Kataja and the Rivers to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost every salibandy MM race since 2003.
Now in Tampere, there are already six races, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American carnivals.
I was working in Turku and playing there with women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a gymnastics team.
I was interested, and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, that kind of thing wasn't played at SM level yet, just like a salibandy.
The radio was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the SM series for the period 1991-92 with the university, the following three runs went by in Josba.
Besides playing, he trained the A girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career culminated in silver 1995.
All Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, the balance accumulated in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.

Beach Volley artist Essi Hasun circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish Championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, measurements are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airballers and the Finnish Airball Union, the SM Final Tournament will qualify for the six best pairs in each series.
Local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's breeder Essi Hasu, who has belonged to the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Nowadays, Hasu in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the viewing room this weekend.
I'm sure the Pesisstadion's going to be a great arena.
I haven't played very often in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finest home corners, Hasu tunnelmoi.
The Kouvola region lit the Hasu spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in the minds of the child.
When I was 9 years old, I started a balloon at Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The main one is in mind too big a game shirt, knee shields spinning ankles, as well as splendid ass screams and choreographies after point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's shared spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were in a strong way with the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural variety choice in junior time to counterweight indoor balloon.
There's been a party on the curve lamp beach since the 1990s.
The operation on the stand has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with the little Anniina Parkkie in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second ranked two in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are awaiting civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly left as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk intakes, sweat and energies.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli soon started two years ago, together with his little brother Valtter Koli, as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels brothers with his own experience.
Beginning as a rural entrepreneur meant a debt and an increase in order to allow bread to come into hand with agriculture.
This has been my case since the little boy.
I've always been happy to work on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a yard tower, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very courageous to participate in the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is still going to be good.
The goal of Salomon Kol, which is growing meat cars, is to invest in an even larger ship.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of a young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
At best, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until 21 August.

The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.

Snapchat anime efficiency is criticised as Asian karikatyr
Snapchat says it was an anime that was inspired by that filter, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat's Lens Tool, about 150 million users daily can change reality and play identity in ways that bring absurdity closer.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are unbeatable, distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All misleading steps come to public knowledge quickly.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or whited skin tones as a taste of beauty.
So when it offered part of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into blurred, counterfeited teeth and made cheeks, some of the critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions refer to the greater problem that the company has with differences.
The news and rage spread on a broad Wednesday and wrote about it, including online publications The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat reported that he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not an Asian cartoon.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them strongly contested the anime comparison.
The Korean American art student Grace Sparapa, whose tweets were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the assimilation of the highly tasteless Asian carocatyre to the filter's efficiency.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but that it was taken to a despicable extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it seems that there is an endless struggle between differentiation and social participation, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment that we transport with us.
Snapchat's large audience consists of young people who, from their ethnic backgrounds, are more diverse than their parents' responses. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more subtleness.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, this type of thing will no longer be very easily missed, as before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu at the interview on Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview published in the Medium, he said that he believed that ethnic contradictions reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized most of the company's white and only male leadership and decided to write with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that in their one-sided staff there are no colored people who can make such decisions, or then they also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they dare to tell their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, appealing to its position as a private undertaking.
Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss his staff's ethnic backgrounds, but according to his informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented human groups and the promotion of participation within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he likes his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress Expert Group, military officials distorted the intelligence of Fathers
On Thursday, the Congress expert group published a report that officials from the U.S. Armed Forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the Fathers in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground allowed us to understand.
The Vice-Presidents of the Republican Sub-Committee on Inquiry and Defence Provisions (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of the military intelligence analysts in the interim report. According to the analysts, the senior military authorities were adorned by the assessment of the actions of the Americans against Fathers.
In short, Central Command, Centcom, is a U.S. military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The enquiry results approved by the senior directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the United States' counter-terrorism actions than the facts on the ground showed, and were unexceptionally more positive than the analysis of the other services of the intelligence community," is reported in the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers," says Republican Representative Ken Calvert of California.
"Centcom's lead gate errors extend to the top level of the organisation."
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of the actions of the Americans to educate Iraqi forces include.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities have been counterfeited, it gives the analysts a picture that gives the impression that the Centcom leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Iss.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimonies were much more positive than the events actually were," the report says.
"For example, Centcom's official publicly issued a statement that a large military rally for the re-target of Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Daddy.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican Representative of Kansas Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"From mid-2015 to mid-2015, the U.S. military intelligence chiefs manipulated the intelligence results obtained to reduce the threat of Father in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about the doubts posed by analysts that the intelligence information on Fathers would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Overinspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated the Centcom Intelligence Survey.
On Thursday, democrats from the Committee on Inquiry in the House published their own results, which were partially consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"At the end of 2014-2015, Centcom created a too limited process for evaluating intelligence data on the Israel and Iraq security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the high-ranking Democratic Representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "was delaying the publication of intelligence results, "infringing the morality of analysts" and "insufficiently observing differing views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to put pressure on Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to a ‘predetermined or political official line'.
The news site Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a study by Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon overinspector, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says when he reports that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the overinspector's investigation is under way.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation will also have other consequences in addition to its efforts to determine whether the bombings led by the United States have been successful in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by more and more defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year could question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and how honestly it can assess the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The critique against the intelligence of fathers responds to the differences that occurred over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which the government of President George W. Bush, despite many objections from analysts, supported only small forces in Iraq and spent only a short time thinking about what would be the result of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the Father.
According to the authorities last year, Hooker's working group concluded that, despite opposing public opinions, the express attacks on the refineries dominated by Iss had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries and thus been able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside of Central Command, reports in The Times in September.
At that time, the Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and instead of him, General Joseph L. Votel became Commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth double battle in women's land hockey and establishes its position in the process of exposing with Britain
After making three goals in the winning game of the painter 6-1 against Japan, Katie Bam made two first goals for the U.S. Women's Hockey Country Team on Thursday, when the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure whether he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who like the number of paints they make."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share their group's first place with Britain, which continued to win on Thursday in Japan chapters 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States play opposite on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which resolves which of them is located in the first and second block of the six teams.
The first placement is to avoid meeting harder with the Dutch team who won the second block for longer.
Regardless of what happens in the Saturday game, the Americans have already raised their stunning success in these races, four years after it became the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and grabbed his land hockey bat for the first time only at the age of 3 (his parents played the game of twin sisters in Drexel).
The 2008 Olympics missed him when he did not survive the final playlist.
Then came the 2012 races where he and his team did not very much see successes.
The following year, an English coach was appointed Craig Parnham, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our goal in London was not what it is now.
We've made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half of the time by hitting the ball near the ball with a rustling in.
India had come to the game without any tournament wins, but it proved surprisingly hard to oppose and kept the situation between 1 and 0 until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, swirled into the middle field, hit the ball goal and thus took the Americans to 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth cycle.
The game was the first tournament in which the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had hit each one hit.
Briggs is now living for his success.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Olympic Hulina, trampoline brings zen.
Whatever the location and time the Olympics will inevitably collide.
Rio de Janeiro's events, competitions and struggles seem to be following as a vibrant message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic wind itself would be a flame in a message cape that moves from the bow booth to the swimmer, the swimmer to the gymnastics and the gymnastics to the triathlonist.
You can't open TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line with the cafeteria without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then he's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first Olympian Dooley charms his smile and might well be a name on the lips that would be visible and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in TV ads of good mind if he were just a swimmer, a gymnasticist or even a swordwriter.
But Dooley from Lake Forest of California, 28, competes for Olympic Gold with trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not enlighten all competitions equally.
Farther from the middle, partly in the shadow are less known sports, such as air pistol fire, bow fire, football and taekwondo.
We will always have a breastfight, and let the championship remain with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favourite, I'd like to draw attention to the constrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so small that many people I interviewed did not even know it was the Olympic species.
Unconsciousness can be regionally specific.
Yes, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic Trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals and progressed in the finals before 2012.
Men's trampoline medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and women's side of the medals have been trapped by Canadians.
This year, the Chinese Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London.
Trampoline, however, has the attractiveness of the contestant. Partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this connection that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species has a combining of its potential, used in drawing films in the endless character bombing scenes, but it also has the same value as in gymnastics and swimming jumps, i.e. species that combine essentially with trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "pompoline board".
Honourable masters jump with a huge trampoline that squeezes them to an altitude of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as cycles, skills and voltages.
According to the official Olympics programme, jumps are criticised on the basis of performance, difficulty and "airtime".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries are competing for the championship of the Trampoline Force, with 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympic species is directly forward.
When looking for gold, the medal brains must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the line of paint, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the wall of departure, they also have another objective that they seek in televisionized reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is exquisite, admirable, even fanatic — even enough to get a watcher to tear.
But I also think this is a bit exhausting just when we look at the races.
This trampoline offers a breath break.
Trampoline's upwards.
The aim is not to move forward.
It's like an astronaut. It's like a forceless one. It's falling down. It's like a forceless one.
Of course, the species also includes a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a fast rushing into the paint or jumping far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
Women's carnival matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 1300 local times and men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts on each day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the midst of Olympiamania, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment, which may be ignored in the midst of the general hulina.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and by exemplifying them – as U.S. male forces Wall Street Journal recently suggested – in that case, Logan Dooley is only looking forward to a striking new fan.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, which is a long-term United States ally
Violent Demonstrations in Ethiopia
At a time of violence, the government forces have broken up demonstrations calling for political change across Ethiopia.
Witness reports that several demonstrators have been shot to death in contacts with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable Western allies whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been raging anti-government protests that are spreading to wider regions.
Just last week, thousands of people raided into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
The witnesses said the cops shot and killed a number of unarmed demonstrators.
It is assumed that at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, videos show how the security forces beat young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer now calls for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and taking forward even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, research director of the African Sarvi project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new tramway.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still far from the model country of democracy. Human rights organisations have continued to report government oppression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and the disparities are being slowed down quickly.
Many people have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far away to the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and they have no choice but to show their minds, it will unleash," says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer working in Central Ethiopia.
"All young people show their minds.
The whole generation protests."
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, always of the use of land to the power of the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last place before the opposition, resulting in which they now dominate Parliament as a whole.
At the same time, tensions increase on the Eritrean border, where the heightened situation demanded hundreds of deaths during the battle in June.
Analytics fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatists, such as Oromo's Liberation Front or Ogaden's People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearme.
There are many reasons for why the bitter mood that has been ravaged under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smart phones.
For the last couple of years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media when more affordable smartphones became common and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people access the Internet through media services that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they called people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest population groups, oroms and amhars.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
The Amhars from Ethiopia, mainly from the Christian highlands, have long dominated the country's politics and business and ripped off orphanages, most of which are Muslims and live in the inland areas.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Goldmo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have just been in the areas of Goldmo and Amhara.
Many Amhars and Golden Moors experience Ethiopia's unjustly dominating the Tigre tribe, which represents only about 6 percent of the population and, however, dominates the army, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind restlessness is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unreported illness in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who could see the corner behind.
According to analysts, he was particularly capable of detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who arranged between counterparts.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' boots for almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this will mean more bloodshed.
For the last time, similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds against the elections that, according to analysts, the government first blew and then stole.
In post-election disturbances, many protesters were killed, but fewer were dead than in the previous months, and restlessness ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for far-reaching infrastructure planning, such as a new hub train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the inner resentment of the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented strength.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the city of Amhar in Gondar, demonstrators attacked tiger-owned companies, and the tigers' hate speech is becoming widespread in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a situation of trouble.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalian aircraft, but according to the U.S., the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its former unstable ally in the region to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Father.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in his last campaign by claiming that he wasn't serious this week when he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Iss terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the candidate President to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend his candidate at these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant, will also face a pressing situation.
Trump made the claim at the election ceremony on Wednesday night and repeated in different interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created Iss.
On the early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that he was sarcasm.
Trump, on Twitter, completely turned his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was in very serious charge.
When the radio editor and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Daddy, the Republican presidential candidate did not agree to withdraw from his claim.
The latest critical storm rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back into the economy when the profits fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he considered Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has been defended by sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and draws back his words, if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that raise a response to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to the messages, and then he "clarifies" in a way or in a different way depending on the reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has monitored the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his arguments and knows that they are round enough to pass through different seals."
Instead of softening Trump's statements to the electoral community, in recent days he has changed his style even more sharply after his support numbers have continued to fall.
On Friday, the new NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist's opinion survey reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida's situation is tightly balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologies for provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more vigilant in recent months, Trump's jokes have placed his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position where they publicly have to defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, was strongly defending the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words justified as a political speech," Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Daddy.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama totally mistakenly called "the lower team" and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed Iss to continue its efforts when it did not deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of slandering and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked "unsuitable and pathetic" television commentators who were trying to find out about him, but he said they couldn't succeed.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he did not apply as president.
Due to the unreasonable increase in rent, the coffee shop stopped opening at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit devastating coffee shop in Williamsburg, where the payment was only cash and there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the coffee shop was priced out on Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonable.
Verb Cafe in place in summer 2014 Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals consider this under the middle classification to avoid the loss of a coffee shop.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer one, there's also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Café has Wi-Fi and you can pay for it with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the mood is still unsufficient.
The coffee is still good, too.
The owner and head of the new Verb Café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafeteria.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance opening a new café, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon eggs-only cheese-sandwiches available and full of capers and browned onions.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
No more beer from the coffee, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months of coffee shop, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the old standard customers began to go to Verb as a steady stream.
"Including many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafeteria on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk to the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took his usual ice cream coffee instead of a chai tea show, which is also a listing news.
Another long-term client, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyally in Verb since 2003.
He went to the cafeteria all the time before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I stayed in the cafeteria every day over 15 days, like a machine, and there they already made my canbage with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought in the menu new products.
Nowadays, Rosenthal is still holding its standard product, but at times he varies his bagels of bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says there's no resentment that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap for the manufacture of Verb's own cold-cold coffee.
"We can still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The traditional Polish people in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafeteria with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he will seek a suitable place for his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee in the cafeteria.
The café may also expand to the adjacent building.
But for many customers, it's enough that they get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The Great Depression of Food in the New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, a well-known crossman, had liked luxurious food from Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the gooseberry and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in the tomato sauce, potato mushroom and dessert of a peanut.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans, how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights works as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the layer in Lower East Siden district through food.
Their new joint work is the A Square Meal published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food in the late 1930s.
The Parish showed its own culinary solidarity in agreeing with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron Cloud Drawer and was opened in the same year as a major stock exchange crisis, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, turkey, potato mushroom and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat slice, the couple said that it was suitable for a debate on eating a very large period of depression.
"The worries were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut fracture, liver fracture, and bean fracture.
They were made from substances that were cheap and adequate.
Imagine your cancer of so many peanuts that they will suffice for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe's coming.
"It must have been pressed in the stomach like a lead," he says.
Before the big break years, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked with the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, fresh pie was served.
It was precisely the Americans who had sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronic of ways in which the people survived when suddenly they had to give up the abundance.
"This was the time when food became a key and aggravating issue for the Americans," says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new favourable diet was equally distressing: according to Ziegelman, legendary foods such as moulds and potatoes became the main food, and potatoes were called "a powerful means of utilising foods" because the cooks could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which for years had been the main part of the American meal, became savingly used luxury.
Strange mixtures were tested, with the most important being calorie and nutritional values, not just taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
When carrying out a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared ovens filled with peanut butter as a food type.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
The peanut butter and the oven can't fit at all.
This was a feature of many household recipes."
Household experts, as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, guided citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be budgeters and respond to the challenge of making delightful foods such as carrot-kermaspaget.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tastes.
It is particularly tasty to describe the reactions of state management to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood for simple food on the Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a refined master who had become him.
"He liked the continental European cuisine, like fish and peanut sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to show an example in his stomach.
As the book tells, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the foods served in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst produced."
Many of the depressed foods were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be seen in how we pay attention to calories and nutrients and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why he could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"People even began to get sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one of those who have been greasy."
After the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out their homemade fox prints, the same food that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called a lumbar ointment," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a seeming name to modest recipes was a general trick.
There was no creamy cream, only fowls, little flour, sugar, water, and cane.
We swamped our spoons into a thick brown swamp.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe snatched the second time and the third.
"The German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget administrator.
Gilead's full compensation for legal fees for the patenting of C-hepatitis medicine with Merck
The judge of the United States Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the costs incurred by him for the legal dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc concerning the patent of the C-hepatitis medicinal product.
In June, Gilead was exempted from compensation of $200 million for the infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with successful medicines named Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. The US judge found that Merck had committed violations involving misconduct and other unethical practices.
In an appeal lodged on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court stated that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees for the defence of the case.
Merck tries to achieve Gilead, which controls the market with new generation C-hepatitis medicines that can be treated by a high 90% of patients with C-hepatitis.
The case runs in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead medicines.
United States-supported troops have taken over the city of Manbiji from Isis
The US-supported troops have taken over in Northern Syria near the city of Manjib bordering Turkey, when the last extremists of the Isi fighters left the city, reports the reporter of the forces.
The Syrian Democratic Powers (SDF) group now harnessed the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
The representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by the fighters of Issis have been released.
"The city is now completely in our possession, but we are still carrying out search operations," Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes
On Friday, President Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return, which shows that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and that they paid a real federal tax rate of 34.2.
In 2015 the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million as speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Foreign Minister, announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book dealing with his post office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife Anne Holton published 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still showing a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in his briefing.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
It is customary that the US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even though the law does not require it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration and call it the reason why Trump has not published his income data.
"The transfer is yours" by your tweet Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax information on the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Trump Special Rights Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he will not let Trump publish his tax information until the checks are complete.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his grants for charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken on this question and published a video online on Friday where he brings out prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not to publicly state his tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to the Politico online magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a few for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors that could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have risen to the central issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billonaire investor Warren Buffett's designated rule, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters is located in the same location as the Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump's meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet tells us that he has also been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, currently living in Chappaqua, New York State, paid real federal taxes on average 32% in 2007–2014 and the real combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton tax declaration shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had wage earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income in the amount of $109,000.

Chili powdered sausage condoms in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature - protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from human dwellings — the elephants are rushed by throwing chili powdered condoms toward them.
Keino has proved to be effective, and a few years ago the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching the volunteers of the villages of Northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used for the elephant's expedition.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen attitudes changed in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says the director of the Honeyguide Foundation, Damian Bell.
First, the intruding elephant is erupted by showing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, let's throw the so-called chilipil.
The mixture of chili powder is put in the condom together with a sausage, then the head of the condom is closed so that only the ignition wire is excluded.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last means is a thrower that shoots into the air of a known firewall as a Roman candle and gives rise to a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's direction number from the "inviting" of Arabs — RT News
After revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel's direction number in its land number list, the French film director, at its roots, gave birth to a media rage.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, demolished his frustration with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's directory of the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel is completely destroyed – as it would not exist?"
Lanzmann's writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann writes the answer from the reception officer that upset him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the operation was still shocking the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's direction number."
Suddeutsche Zeitung interviewed by the Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the case was "a great shame".
"The way of life is shocking and shocking all of us.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is precisely this hotel chain.
There's no further explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a reaction on the Internet, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving up the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Disgrace" was said in a publication highlighting the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes the charges against the hotel quickly, calls it a mistake and apologizes to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to leave Israel out of the directory was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski, a representative of the hotel.
It adds that the direction number has subsequently been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber to protest Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday with Sao Paulo when they gathered together to show their minds against government education reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber against demonstrators.
The riot began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student crowd, resulting in police use of rubber and tear gas.
Hundreds of students, who wanted to show their disgrace to government plans, participated in the demonstration.
The state governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has made a proposal for a savings measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on walls that temporarily opposed Michel Temeri, the president.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with the dismissed President Dilma Rousseffi's protesters when the Senate voted on this official charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 % – RT Business
The annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the lifting of the force, according to Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priority objectives in cooperation between countries," says Dzhagarya.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade accelerated the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects the record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel in Russia.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, in turn, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotti Callum Skinner fought for the British when he won the gold of cycling.
Scotland's Callum Skinner contested the reputation of the men's teamprint on the Rio Veldrod last night, when the British triangle defended the 2012 championship.
Glasgowlainen 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his countryman from the Scottish Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made a legend proud when he thanked the goal and when he caught the victory from the New Zealand team that was considered a pre-favorable winner.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his sixth Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only invested in the 6th of March in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a leader of the first.
Hindes came out at the right time.
Today's decision to terminate the race also left a hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man in whom British coaches believed and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy's championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in a duel.
Hindes was steadily behind his round, but Kenny worked for the team's leadership position, which Skinner retained.
The big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes was able to slow down the speed at a higher rate, which enabled Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep the pace.
Today followed his place as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' gaze when they entered the prize chorus.
Glasgowlainen, 23, Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the similitude.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the final, and we won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track for bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the British race partners did not have a means of appeal.
This time there were no problems with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The sensation was like in London, all British flags flared in the viewhouse.
Our team was formed together in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory in the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for the country that won seven ten racing stars in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, five days will be successful on the velodrome.
As Kenny has demonstrated, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympics in the Olympics.
This would mean that a six gold medal and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (on the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
Medal aids would sometimes be the same as Hoylla.
Kenny is next competing on the sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton Kenny says, "Now I can only rejoice in this.
The team race is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the value of a knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four men's team warranty.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, made in London 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22.42 p.m.) will compete today on the second day of competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with competing journalists before the time when the competing journalists invited him to measure his length.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavian Katie Archibald achieved world record 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its powerful racing team to take over the Middle Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
From full leadership in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
Background has been the dramas of which the least is the dismissal of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and bullying claims, and the termination of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
On the first night, however, the competitions held on the velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of Britain will rise to the top at the perfect moment once again.
The future of the Portland melting plant at risk as a result of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum sink in the Land of Victoria in Portland and thus thousands of workers' jobs are at risk when the power company supplying electricity to the merchant told that one of the owners of the factory is dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to continue the support for the factory being kept in operation.
Fixed, 20 years of support will cease in November.
There is a risk that up to 2000 jobs will be lost from the Alcoan Portland plant.
Because of closures, even 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to grow, as the meltdown consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, resulting in Anglesea's power plant having to be closed last year.
Alcoan Portland meltdown is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to specimens that have been used over the years since the future of the factory, which first caused Australia's strong dollar and the price of production of the factory recently.
AGL, which delivers electricity to the large aluminium sink from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects that three other meltdown owners will also terminate their contract.
The majority of the factory is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the factory.
AGL says it expects Portland's production plant to operate permanently, which means that the demand for physical electricity from the melting plant continues.
AGL states that the agreements are the so-called safeguard agreements which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The period of termination of contracts is 12 months, thus ending in 2017.
"So AGL expects contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017," says power plant.
Possible return effects on AGL from 2018 onwards are currently limiting strong market prospects for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL already says that it has reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by 187 million dollars "in advance of termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the melting in operation or to secure the supply of electricity in the melting room".
The American company reported that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation of the sector, the analysts have been cautious in their assessments of both the melting plant in Portland and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
In an earlier week's speech to analysts, AGL's operational leader Stephen Mikkelsen told the analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity at the annual level and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it means a significant fall in demand (electric) markets.
For us as a producer, it wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Cardashians reality star Kendall as the cover girl of Vogue in September
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, will be held by the United States in the famous September issue of Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Advertising Face of Estee Lauder and featured in the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Everyone looking in a room full of my loved ones made me tears," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps only Kardashianit style?), a handwritten video showing all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barily bruises Rob and Caitlyn and all the favorite uncle, the producer of the Kardashianit program Ryan Seacrest) and pretending to forget the cover picture of his sister. The video ends in a classic translation: they were all planning a surprise party for his sister.
Juoni is a cliché, and it is used in almost all the birthday sessions (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the picture of children's morning TV), but Krisin had to get the other daughters in some way into this publicity.
The presence of Vogue in September will undoubtedly mean a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendallin's big sister Kim was able to get to Vogue's suit before (he appeared on the deck of Vogue together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is quite his own class.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold publication a year.
The number that resembles fashion accounts attracts a large number of advertisers (formal site from Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of advertising in last year's 832 page).
The publication of the September Floor Star is so fast expected that in the previous two years the images of the magazine have leaked into the public before the official announcement.
Previously in September, films have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrities working on the model than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior-maintained face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later he received the honor of Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even though he would rather be among the celebrities working on the model, he is in a rather good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, true-TV stars, or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can be rightly called talented women who are successful in entertainment over others.
Last year, Beyonce in the cover picture has one of the strongest years of her career when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his real TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a big deal.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitch".
These emotions have stirred up again when the news of Jenner's appearance on the deck of Vogue came out.
However, continuing discouragement of dissatisfaction does not seem essential.
Kendall Jenner is a cover picture model for Vogue's September number.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder's makeup stuff.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he filmed to the LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, he's on the real TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and this kid.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people per year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable situation in the country are turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on the centres operating at the extreme limits.
In the state of Queensland, legal aid and legal services are being turned away from five people already three – most of them are elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unfounded decisions and similar injustices without people fighting resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
From June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Queensland's Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that the latest report of the National Legal Aid Centres report shows that thousands of people are being turned away from the centres annually.
If the federal government doesn't fade its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they seek the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People who leave subordinate relationships, people under uncontrolled and burdensome debt, separated families, unfounded redundant workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30 % from June 2017, which means that thousands of those in the weakest position in Queensland will face complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Justice Chancellor and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now it is time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients' municipalities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was brought against an employee's threat of weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged when no action was expected to be taken after his leadership had been informed that the leader of the North Carolina campaign had threatened the worker with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint filed by former software trainer of the state campaign by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he's been waiting for months for the situation to be dealt with inside the campaign before, according to his own words, he realized that this will not happen.
Bordini says that the campaign manager, Earl Phillip, "pulled out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe on Vincent's knees."
According to the complaint, after making a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his complaint.
Only two days after the republican presidential candidate caused a general outrage in telling the people in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional seat" – where gunowners and gunmakers are held – can take action if his counter-proposed Hillary Clinton wins the election and is eligible to elect judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his words from the context and Trump said that he did not encourage violence.
Bordini is demanding compensation from the campaign for indifferent and Phillip for overthrow, assault and mental suffering.
Trump's informant Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message requesting a comment.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call request submitted to Phillip's consultancy company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican President's candidate Donald Trump has been on a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity — not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was a fact that was most interested in Heathrow. As in the 2012 Olympics in London, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of learning and 40 000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face the embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
Winning obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that will benefit many instead of few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by 211 billion GBP, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force in Heathrow, which has carried out on time and with a budget of £11 billion in infrastructure investment programme, including the T5 terminal – which has been voted for the best air terminal for the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two world's most congestive roads.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee our trade in the future and create knowledge and employment for which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Government and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising in Cat-Mouse Games
The attempts of businesses that deserve money from online advertising to distract advertising software have turned into cat-mouse-plays, says one of the companies that produces prevention programs.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it was blocking advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it told users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change its desktop site's advertising codes so that advertising programs will be harder to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's cleared the new codes.
Adblock's reporter Ben Williams wrote in his blog that "this kind of ballooning between the open source code advertising community and misleaders has been underway since the invention of the advertising protest" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon do its own repairs.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong sign of the great concern that advertisers have formed in the sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use advertising programs, reports Pagefair and Adobe's research last year. The figure has almost doubled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to contribute to the distraction of advertising prevention programmes in its desktop application, as the information provider says that mobile advertising prevention programs do not operate in Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still sufficiently large, which is why Facebook considered the stake to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it will update the Advertising Tool for user settings so that users can more monitor how to target ads for them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters as they also prevent the sighting of some of the usual Facebook articles.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," the Facebook informant said when emailing.
"Mainstreaming programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that is why we have invested in the development of user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by dropping herself under cars on a Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking witnesses for help on the motorway on Thursday's first hour of an accident in which a woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaudi near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her despair by laying on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says the police in Vaudi's briefing.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly to commit suicide, and there was also a truck among the cars that were overwhelmed.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter, at Le Tribune de Geneve, tells us that the criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical phase in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges are brought against drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid the crash?
It's left to the D.A.'s," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred, on the basis of which drivers are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on a dark motorway and the court decided that drivers cannot expect to run into a pedestrian in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the charge against him of death after he met a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and turned out on the road.
The Court held that the police — who were responding to an emergency call — were justified and the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
On Thursday, all those who are aware of the accident near Morges are asked to call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows Venus to explore the past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus have sometimes been similar to that on earth, although Venus is hot and waterless in the surface and its gas frame consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous performances by researchers, Venus' slow rotation speed is explained by its thick gas frame.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, Venus has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet it has slowly rotated.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than in Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% more lush.
"In the modeling of the GISS, Venus is slowly rotating and its day is almost two months at a time per sun," explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms the surface and gives rise to rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like the umbrella and protects the surface from the sun's heat in large terms.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the Earth's current temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions by planet scientists of its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed for several billion years to excessive heat and ultraviolets.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet burned steamed water.
In hydrogen karate, there was only a thick carbon-containing gas ket and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy quits his place as a Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as a coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and as Deputy Director of hockey activities, appealing to the lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Mr. Joe Sakic, vice president/chairman of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the company would immediately begin to apply for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I've done my job as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and I've been following you as Deputy Director of hockey activities with vigor, passion and determination," says Roy, a 50-year-old in his Communication.
"In the summer I have long and earnestly wondered how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Director-General of hockey activities of the coach and the company must be fully on the same lines with the organisation.
He must also have authority in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his commitment to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award Prize as the best coach of the league for his first season as the main coach for Avalanche 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the company reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in drop-off games and hasn't reached the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points for the period 2015-2016 and remained five points at the end of Minnesota Wild when playing from the second Wild Card place at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cupies in his career — two in the Montreal Canadiens rows and two in the Avalanche rows.
Oil workers in the North Sea begin negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say that the wage strikes of oil workers in the North Sea are interrupted when all the parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been subjected to strikes on drilling vessels under the management of Royal Dutch Shell, located in the North Sea.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and the Unions Unite and RMT shall strengthen their agreements on the reopening of the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will hold a number of day-long meetings for the next few weeks in which we are dealing with fresh issues.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which they claim to have been the first for more than 25 years, as a protest for possible 30 per cent pay cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9 % of the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year.
The company's reduction in tariffs is in line with the calculation of the prices of contractors working in the country by 10 % in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the necessary mobility to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut out thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, thus attempting to enhance its activities after its mega-fusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
The lower prices of crude oil and the economic situation resulting from Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June create pressure for energy companies.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met the Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major discussions that have taken place in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He says the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that benefits many and not just few," says Anderson.
For new projects in the North Sea, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent in 2016, when around $7 billion has been spent over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars in the Plejadis Stars
The most recent task of Kepler's astronomers has been to measure the speed of rotation of stars, which has helped the astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speeds of rotation of the stars of Plejadis.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why the stars of the same star range rotate at different speeds and how the cycles relate to the planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing results with other stars we will learn more from the relationship between weight and age and even from the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University's infrared processing and analysis centre in the press release.
The Plejadi starjob is located 445 light years from the earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're spinning faster now than ever.
At the top of the cycle speed, large numbers of adult stars erupt from the star.
These winds have a frenetic effect on stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by following the time between the appearance of identifiable star piles (which correspond to sunpiles).
The latest listed speed data indicate that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — bigger than smaller ones.
"We see Plejadi's "dance", that slow spinning are typically larger, while the fastest spinning are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since Plejadi's star group is so close, it functions as an ideal space laboratory that allows the star's characteristics to be compared to the rotation speed.
"Plejad's starjob offers a pile of support to theoretical models that deal with spinning both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Plejadis' rotation speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
