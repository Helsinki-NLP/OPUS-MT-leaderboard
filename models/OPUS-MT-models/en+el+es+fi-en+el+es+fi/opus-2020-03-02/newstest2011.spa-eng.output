What do you say? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery
The new councillors of ČSSD in the capital will seem to have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
The period Aktuálnę.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in the Council in recent years, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The encoded dictionary using Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I am rather a novice in Praguen politics," he said during the terminology examination of "college" the culture councillor Lukhaš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf day."
"Possibly it's the only expression of all you asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, normally I don't work slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuálnę.cz last June before the ODS polling congress, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major golf hole of Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "noodle noodle", "tradition of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors accepted the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, who will in the future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get into these things and I'm not going to appreciate how the civic Democrats have fun."
"What does matter to me is how we will understand ourselves in the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councillor Lukhaš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term that succeeded in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know it more by the news."
"I'm gonna have to go to a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the Environmental Councillor Lukhaš Plachý.
Then, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems we have nothing like that."
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we make word games with the names," says ČSSD President Praguense, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"In school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálnę.cz tested the name and works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Dęda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dędek ("old"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they joined before the deceitful elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálnę.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Praguean president.
"The doctor of the rights of the pores" seems to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his PhD in Law at Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are often older, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such but."
"Not even healthy young women are isolated because they help in labor and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso is in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information brochure that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," says Die Standard on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, Burkina Faso's neighbouring country, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared at the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman took on the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was set on fire when the group wanted "to expel the bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witch" supports people at all levels of education.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul devours always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government was attempting to pacifize witch hunting, the President was still involved in it in the Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt of witches who had allegedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him bring shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forced to take men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai," says Amnesty International.
In the farm, the arrested people had to drink a pocim of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
The tenant of Bakala: heated with coal stoves and signed a higher rent
The man, old and rich, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal magnate" Zdeęek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving sentence.
The three of them have just been caught by the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-bedroom floor with separate second-category kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, the man only makes a deed.
"Everything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory for testing liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That's why Aktuálnę.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
RPG's mining waiting room is one of Ostrava's four and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up the number.
"Lease 2011", can be read in a luminous button on your touch screen.
By pressing it, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It almost doesn't give time to read "157" and the number already appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the tail.
Shortly after, an old-age marriage comes to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as formerly: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the tenants' mailboxes of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in rent from 15 to 38% in the letters.
On November 18, a special window is opened at the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after briefly questioning, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most sensitive themes in the area.
Before the elections, they were treated loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originally Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"They didn't change my fucking bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction goes off.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a rental discount if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," she estimates.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must resolve the issue.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least partly, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells you in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, which adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rentals to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7.50 Czech kronas per month per square metre," is indicated on the screen.
Only increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities, of 19.66 crowns per square metre," RPG indicates.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not strikingly affect rents, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see the chart) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Persons who sign the lease-up agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need nursery
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with everything that is proper to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose study numerous well-known buildings emerged from Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its minigarde.
The company employs about 90 people, mainly at the age of baby boom and wanted to allow architects and delineants to return to work soon after maternity.
Together with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, childcare is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to your workers within the framework of your social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of children.
The minigarde was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the leadership, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guards are financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operation Programme as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a budget of more than 2.8 million Czech krona) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-garde in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding the company Economy Rating contributed.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day long; the childcare centre currently accommodates children without a limit of age, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guard care" it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of childcare is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use childcare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the minigarde programme are comparable to the usual pre-school education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid stress from collecting late school children when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its similar form to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that reminds the scales and the omnipresent softly curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with onyric lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
With more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order are observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the torsion of the shapes continue to surprise us also inside it.
The undulated wood copies the frames of the windows, the bars, the ornaments of the doors, the mills and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood on the 43th of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, did not design it alone Antoni Gaudí.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the façade.
On the façade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell de Gaudí park, where other parts of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the premises shortly after their completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, because of the specific window opening mechanism, began to call it "the house of the moanings".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of Saint George, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculpture elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating time with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange your inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the construction rules of the moment and was not allowed to influence by them.
However, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although clearly in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at the end of the construction, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it requested that it be corrected.
He was disturbed, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the City Council's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
On the second floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and slots.
The game with the two colors gives the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlights.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house you will find the most spacious and more recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount exceeds considerably the price of the entry of other buildings of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How to choose mattress and somier: women and men seek different things
Nothing about a pompous bed frame; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and the somier.
First and foremost, they must be complemented perfectly so that they are adapted to specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the owner's weight, height, health status and sex.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more often.
If the canals of the center are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, keep the moisture inside. Even mold may appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs are also influenced.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling well on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their wrecked shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastics."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they get poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magnifles, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don't have to be a player of the NHL anymore to appreciate the viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around like after a hard game.
She just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as protection against wounds.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you lie upside down, you should have your hands comfortably shredded towards the elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouníkě to dekoratér, who has been dealing with the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, the subject he teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combining the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sockets at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior docks of at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle on the mattress, you certainly shouldn't notice the docks," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are like siameses, have no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we breathe between 0,2 and 0,75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life of the mattress up to 25 years or even a life assurance.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and wash easily.
Although mattress cases with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in larger models (and for one person) by lifting the mattress may look like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, you should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with docks inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non- articulable sheet somnants containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a somier with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and can be regulated.
The joint sheet somnants should not be used with a spring mattress, as they do not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "rode" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structure or boards with so-called multitorsion buffering.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
You should also take into account that, even if you use the right mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mould"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying sideways, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, apparently, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is manufactured only from materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of mattress case, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress fund absorbs the heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the mattress.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
The favorites now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows for the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role often have a lower VAT, as they are considered to be sanitary.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save on mattresses and somnolence.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or vendors can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory Memory attached to the case by 11.990 crowns.
The second is available free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It originally emerged as a material for NASA, because during the astronaut take-offs they were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think of controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle monitoring, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a match box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and they began to report on the means available to protect their children better.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
"We all try to say that it is not about spying, but another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that, if the child doesn't want to carry it, she'll just throw it away.
"Even the younger children show great creativity in losing certain things intentionally if they want to prevent them from being controlled."
"Before, parents had enormous confidence in mobile phones, but these could be shut down as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In your opinion, it is questionable if in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the author will practically always check whether the child carries any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"According to the extension of the use of tracking devices, you will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised paedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services for both vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a given period."
"If it is damaged, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have an integrated inclination gauge, so if the person simply slips and stays immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, where only a special software should be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that at the moment these are devices with a size similar to a match box or smaller mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to Pilin by Macro Weil, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or Identify him after some time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology as is used for tracking vehicles.
This is the check of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone communicating the current position.
The army has enough moulds to surround the entire Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to light explosives.
As of last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the cloak is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the mecha for explosives from the STV Group, a.m. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of cloak saying that soldiers need for 60 kilometres of cloak training maneuvers a year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in this case, they should perform such manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempted from either the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometers of mecha.
Such length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even by adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 mentioned above.
The soldiers of the Quick Intervention Brigade complained to Minister Vondra recently because they say that they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even the shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that such quantities of mecha are repeatedly bought from us either."
"But it is your decision and you will certainly know why you act like that."
"For us, the army is a good customer whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director, Jan Dęcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of miles of mecha also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Dęcký, of STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a lifetime of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument by the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of mecha by police pyrotechnics, who eliminate the ammunition from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask for only the fair amount to deplete the ammunition before their lifetime ends.
It was decided for security reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable stool types can be obtained.
The Ministry has already had clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometres of old stool will have to be removed, which is now being bought "bare".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest.
Winning the "Business of the Year" competition helped Lukhaš Pytloun in selling the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken out of a movie.
Lukhaš Pytloun loved traveling.
He realized abroad that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal work abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half ruined composed of five floors.
Bearing in mind that he was still studying his third year at college, he was really brave.
"Today, the quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukhaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was reinvested in the building, which gradually became a 54-bedroom pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four bed and breakfasts, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four star design hotel Pytloun.
This year, however, opened another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a franchise of Pytloun," said businessman number one last year.
"To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped greatly to win the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' competition," he adds thankful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends that everyone want to try some company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his view, also included in employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears on the front page," says modestly Lukhaš Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a more quiet year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the victor's hard work, it's possible that Farmet has already been the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Žęárský, received the first prize in the latest edition of the Vodafone contest "Business of the Year", last year at the "Slave House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česka Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and enhanced our confidence in fighting competition," says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father Karel's arský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not doubt too much; he gave up his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also obtained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only our customers began to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Žárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, partly, 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, led companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously do not get rid of such a situation either."
"Revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some dismissals," Karel Žárský explains.
A viable company should sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of all, where Farmet did not cut expenditure was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs," says Žárský.
It all indicates that they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous standards.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of almost 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its staff members can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial registry when carrying out a control of the insured's taxes," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraęová.
The objective of the year's Absurdez survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Czechia must respect and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year it forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create hobby also among the general public.
While last year's edition was attended by 3,000 voters, this year it nearly reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations left over that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of roles needed for the tax declaration we are first in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business standards is a declared goal of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Czech Republic is in position 74th, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the absurdity he gets the most votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
The examples sent them both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
The competition's "finalists" included, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year's seventy proposals is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state constantly blocks entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessarily complicated," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in the water of erasures.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate in advance of three days to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work travel of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one is defeated.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two scales of soil.
This year, the Ministry of Health issued a communication stating that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and which support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde contest of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the Vodafone Company's main competition of 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between each other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, in others the personal or health problems of the employees.
Among the 14 finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Podębrad, there is a paper shop that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chechnya and in the Vodafone Company contest of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given because it purchases Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities will have the lowest possible impact on the environment," explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses catering services from a locally protected company.
"In addition, we support the "Person in distress" scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý's company representative.
They are also well placed with a mention of the Praní laundry company to čištęní in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch's construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition for the year were automatically appointed who responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company contest of the year."
"The individual candidatures for this contest are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main enterprise contest of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the agricultural fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the agricultural fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate businessman Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of rights so that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public invitation to tender," Právo told Pilsen's Chief Attorney General Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he can't disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
The way in which it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesperson of the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocatory for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the proposed land.
"These people, during the call, offer a value greater than the value of their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be submitted to the call and, given that he was at the same time an interested person because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was collecting a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of disposing of the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been made.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land planned for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the city's own historic center with a very superior value.
In this case, the City Council had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would avoid construction.
Families must pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rentals.
Therefore, families will have to get several hundred crowns a month more out of the portfolio as of January than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas increases by around 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 more a year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices because of increased support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic sources.
However, gas increases moderately, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore consumption is greater.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundreds more a year.
While electricity and gas increase throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 more crowns a month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9 per cent increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Pragueans will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague may increase considerably, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns around 2,500 floors in Ustí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents from around 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10 per cent.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in shape, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to the termination of young drinking medical care at the age of less than fifteen.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in admissions to paediatric care in the hospital.
"Beer or wine is no longer in fashion, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," the head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Ludęk Pelikán, tells Právos.
"When they manage to grab a bottle from their dad from the wardrobe, it can be whiskey, but it's usually about Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of leaning with juice and not smelling so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use an opaque that they took home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers are usually present in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances carried young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of 12, when it was brought with 3.5 blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture of ecstasy," the department's doctor says on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependence cannot be properly discussed.
"An alcoholic means a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," says Chief Pelikán.
According to spokesperson Jurinová, this year in Motol's paediatric clinic, 40 drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the outpatient medical examination, go home with parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink in the eye, there are three seasonal uprisings for Pelikán: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunken children at the same time," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Maternal headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and with nutrients that are missing in the body.
"They take it much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and do not hurt anything."
"They are only confusing about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that, often, patients lose their mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
An ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer at a youth job to earn enough to pay themselves that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in your opinion, may be a regressive measure, which usually returns to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time a device like this is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the two-place version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and which was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three planes are the L-159 monologue.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the physical aircraft will be withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-moving aircraft, instead, were separated from the repaired aircraft long ago, without investments or additional contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplate were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not lack two-way aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract amounting to 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-way.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to add the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by Mirek Topolánek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may possibly have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already reported to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft making a European invitation to tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at the Praguean airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than annulment indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than annulment are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger of the right hand shorter than the annulment.
They presented the same probability of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than annulment finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with ages below 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chechnya, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday in the snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitanieve machines circulared all night through numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents in industrial vehicles and cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the 91st mile, a truck broke out, in the 93s two industrial vehicles crashed and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the cradle.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at 190 km or cross Brno and join 182 km in Kývalce.
There have been several kilometres of concussions.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Barrels are being formed, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested Štęrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams circulate late, for example on the line between Karlovo námęstí and Namęstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airports.
Due to snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzynę airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night to 5 p.m.
Currently, you can already circulate on most of the southern roads of Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska, three secondary roads are closed, snow languages are being formed in Brnęnska, and in Blanenska, chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathies).
The roads in the region which, given that it is a protected natural area, should simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In Chechnya they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfalls are gradually referred to in Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is employing a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
Generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" to make their victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise shot.
Their bullets are shot with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when it launches its murderous rain of metallic splinters, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses a "intelligible" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and presses the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette points out.
400 jobs moved
Fujitsu consortium transfers its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium transfers its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computer specialist sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße street in the Niederrad district, in Frankfurt.
One spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously spread over the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, "in Franckurt-Niederrad we have found a central site with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt's Head of Economy, Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has won a "Global Player".
This is a "major recognition of the site".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The address first informed the city of its intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives produced the fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building are shown cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project for the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that used the holes as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisor and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central electrical technology association and the electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats Against Assange
The anguish takes more and more over Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the revelation platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revealing platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website to deal with high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate's security council had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British "Guardian".
"I wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and disrespectful Wikileaks process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted people.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is arrested in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has constantly described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why you're afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North American statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, a head of government advisor Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for American President Barack Obama, described as "ridical and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the State Secretary, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks recently.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptionally responsible, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' leakage.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize Wikileaks' publication.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
Ice cream college
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream shops are prepared in the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream shops has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of the preparation of ice creams.
The gelataium takes the cream out of the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream college with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream shops has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries across all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years of energetic work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is its good taste decisive, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic."
The first step towards elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws out the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then opens the machine tap and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without stabilizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experience?
Luciano advises that they be discouraged from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite an ice cream sound of granite.
Certain variations in basic mass are permitted.
Scents are used.
As to the taste of the ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to put flavoured ingredients in their merchandise."
"But you must experience sometime."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the ice cream machines.
Luciano allows them to prepare four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with fruit ice cream types.
That you know better doesn't necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit purple.
It is not necessary for hazel ice cream to know dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabiliser.
First a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is an artimatic problem: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe needs to be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the vinegar for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Making ice cream requires nothing but physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, which simultaneously beats the prepared ice cream mixture and cools at low zero temperature.
Despite everything, all automation is left out as to the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puré, as if it were a giant mini-prime without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time for something like that to happen."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts at Efsa on genetically modified plants, and another expert at Efsa have also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Ephsa testing standards of genetically modified plants, which puts it in a clear conflict of interests, criticizes Then.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and he has changed his side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clarividente.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high and technical quality, ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?", asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to knock down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again was the same: Thousands and thousands manifested themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was debrised.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap, poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous ammunition warehouse in the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everything that came out of the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grinding the gravel or sending it to the dump," he says in his office, a wooden house that once was a guardhouse.
They insulted and threatened him, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything at all for the shooting down.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the 80-kilometre cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
Approximately half of it is still in the woods, the rest of it has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on.
Stuttgart's stone of impulse has long become "the wall" or Kräuterbeeten's delimitation.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He ascends to his earthside, makes a tour for his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a rock lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer of ancient stones in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are art stones of chopped sandstone.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red Arenisca, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Bonito travertino."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the rostrum of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police chief, red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, toba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple gear and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone dealer, in addition to barbers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmiller and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes care of the remains.
You'll soon have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Struggle of talents around great potentials
Queen an active influx in the buffet.
16 students hang around the breads, the tomato soup and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: Hire as soon as possible the most talented students from universities, before entering the labour market and being hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try to taste the exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins talents.
A lady from the staff department shares pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the enthusiastic young talents the practice programs and work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University runs the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, watch more closely interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not unusual.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point before was in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified labour force.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI) in German, there were 40,000 vacant engineers in October.
And, according to the VDI prognostics, this emptiness of engineers will grow even further.
In the auditory and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes costly recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a modern yincan type, in which participants have to find their way through the GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice on the exit.
Only the crème of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct rapprochement at the campus, they are also to hunt, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, in charge of personnel for Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacant posts are available on the company's website.
"It's very complicated to fill vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or perform your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A great consortium can normally not offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The key factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good promotional opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld ranks 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied you are with the work and the environment in it and observe the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification for her job seekers.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly concerned with the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the sector jargon is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the template itself.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drills
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico there has been no new oil drilling in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus annulled its previous plans in an inappropriate manner.
Also before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains closed for the time being.
This was announced by the interior minister, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce US dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigation commission commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peterolear consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, who has been charged with corruption charges, has fallen into discredit, is being reformed at root.
Obama also announces that the lucrative tax gaps for the oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"Government plans are the biggest brake to the growth of oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the BDO consulting company - before the Wednesday ban on extraction.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonged, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is marron oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari feels good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys waving in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It can't be seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Earlier here, he took handcuffed shrimp, explains Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
The fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach the waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions of the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Rather than clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, who submerges his hand into the water, will extract some oil filled.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark gilded sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that crash and hang their palms.
In vain, bird bandages are sought, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with a gasoline scent expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says, hurricane, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a conflicting battlefield for years: Here over 60 years ago the first European explorers, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden to return companies to Ogoniland: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the whole delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms were excelled as sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" warmly called the heads of the drills.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every instant a head fails, Akpobari says, then manages a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to the experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the fault of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, ecologists see heads about to break and pipelines with leaks as the main causers.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of safety normally in the world the conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the indices of pipe defects are "on a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In one place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil under the free sky appears, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
One of the many barrels, sometimes linked to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, burns a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drip and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel daily: "He gives us 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-inch per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which trucked the pipeline network that crosses Ogoniland: According to experts, at this stage at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger delta.
Only a negligible part of the stockpiled provisional raw material is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and senior military officials, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheap on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the weak way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no thefts, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a consortium deduction appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscle Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army's special unit takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn invention has completely destroyed our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Airbus de Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than can be imagined: Australian air safety authorities perceived, thanks to their investigations, a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted to a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated implications: In a sleeve connection, fatigue or crack fissures can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit at the federal court in Sidney that allowed more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests to the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesperson for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada throughout the country causes chaos in traffic
Fully white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost all of the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Is Ice Germany: In almost all of the country gelid temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited in most motorways and in many streets.
In the A7 at Flensburg's height, the removenieves are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong wind streaks sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia meteorological service, the red alert is convened in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partly 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disorders in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created jams.
In Turingia, snowfalls affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees fallen on the lanes or the broken catenaria and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the inter-urban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia, an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
The firemen and the rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesperson from the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The quitanieves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stuck at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machineman suffered mild wounds.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit on a crossroads because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have a good news: Snow will be increasingly softer and dusty and therefore snorkel in soft streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank finds a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks to buy for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as stated by the "Financial Times Deutschland" based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not designate the reasons for the sale on the project.
"We always check whether the property should be owned or sold and then re-rented," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution resigns to its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed today, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misery.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of the misfortune, but he did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could go down for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
At present, family members and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining brightness of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand Island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the miners buried, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, underwear and surfboards.
The flags waved half this way before the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume his son's death until he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, told journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epopeia "Walhalla Rising".
What public would Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip off his enemies' guts from his bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Onejo, as it's actually called, says almost no word throughout the film, and the other characters get carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the frames offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers and interested in existentialism and very calmed camera movements.
When a movie has several target groups, it is a pity that they cannot be excluded from each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the combing drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all the public with something more humor in the mainstream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and guts that come out can't deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity is stuck in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and goes back to silence there.
It's a pity that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, it's all atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a movie.
And that's why there's no escape for the viewers.
Refn is counted just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images and the lugure trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who faithfully supports Onejo, retains something like innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for provisional enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country rejects its opinion on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with aid from North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA International Intelligence Service in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the close proximity of the Kibar that is very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique only serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon's nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the proximity or from the interior.
The reactor was operating a little while ago, he says, but it was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is barely more known than at that time, the riddles became older over time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack, the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he had barely seen indications that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer stoningly that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and broke the ground into consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium scratches in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a greater information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not come to the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always suggested that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unreasonable after particle analysis.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss it, in the same way as with satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited a second inspection in the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in IAEA in Vienna, there is finally a serious breach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which is up to IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarifying, which must be "functional" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until the time of which teams they are involved, or what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has once again appointed as an inmate Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, deriving from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly at or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits entry into all three locations to IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record that the United States has requested IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the bucket to the banks of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities" or uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should later be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There are also no doubts as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in the three places.
As the hundreds of loads of the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the rubble remains.
OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photographs from the orbit show that Syrians carried out land movements in all three suspected places and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, allowing Syrians, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, has cried out the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the coming nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: for this, most of the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "And what if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut still without a name.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
It is not known much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serb rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, with which at the last minute they moved a few days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victim organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He is not a diplomat, women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in rape camps, and Jolie's position on it gives the victims enough on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write about the scenes?
The ministry of Bosnian culture that read the script, granted behind a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself very hard into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
On the network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with a torturer".
I'm sure Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unjust and based on wrong information."
Today they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No sign of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans cry out of joy as they rebuild high music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the South African Cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this messy drinking game and discreet computer actually don't make good migas.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will hold for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January it will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "of a shooter he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave comes comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, the melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses mainly the well-trained young people, Irish, for whom so far everything is uphill.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, will go and lose our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a grim future appear because the government is dedicated only to assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
He observes how his companions go from unresumed practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
Photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada appear on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since long ago he first stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes for iced rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens before the houses, on the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one must be hungry, our situation is, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, that in the last big economic crisis he went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see how life is somewhere else.
He's been working a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand be doing well?
But in these days there is one thing you are very worried about: the celebration of your 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Bye, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a march party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime caused greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in most parts of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it enables monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related issues are highlighted in the results of this year's survey in September and early October.
The first is the relatively lively mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but significantly more than 25 per cent in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent said that they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it had remained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protecting the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such a feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent say that either they or a close relative has been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that has the highest leadership in the region, as 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the country most influential by those surveyed in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to waste
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they happened in a much worse way than foreigners who tried to help the country go back after their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and acts of intimidation.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The detachment is expected to take place in January.
All hopes regarding the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has bare support, if he has any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic razed the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continued to live in tents, great abstention was expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to vote because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been evident, Haitians themselves also think so.
Advancing spikes towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, it will be able to make it a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections that will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife became president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will provide the president with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the trade unions, place it around 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction their priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modify these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its staff claim that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders who had refused a forced prior restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not imply IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when she finishes her term of office, given that she no longer has her husband beside her.
If you do, you will need to earn the support of the middle class, much of which is tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you repudiate, quietly, many of your husband's policies.
Half Hurr over China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a sort of closer union with the continent.
What do you think about Taiwan's big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a comprehensive evaluation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of the continent's feelings, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but shortly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been inclined by Taiwan's total independence, obtained almost 50 per cent of all votes compared to 45 per cent of KMT.
If it were the presidentials, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote rate has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied up with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banders and lightweight girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious attempt to murder rigor missing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly to his face, hurting him and killing a transient.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow down to the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner in the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, candidates spoke about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing will be to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to take place.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the PPD for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served the mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that you can also have relationships with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of an expert group that acts as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the candidates for the PPD would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatician, not to present himself to the presidentials.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT must also do a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman states that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as the local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of non-return has already been crossed."
Nominations to the Grammys: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Artist Reveal category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, represented one of Grammy's surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Revelation category.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of jazz since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums to the market before recording the one that "defines the public identity of that artist".
Its ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly marked a great breakthrough and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated on the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Iyer's competitors include Saxophonist veteran James Moody with "Moody 4B" and John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite star in New Orleans and regular guest in "Treme", of the HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest is considerably inclined towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The savage punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the large camera jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classical albums
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a play for three-motion eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Valor Pärt for his symphony no. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
The nominations for classical music are distributed into thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the Verdi "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated to a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestra function category for directing the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Nominated as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the Committee of Ordinance
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local law enforcement commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and clashes.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha ' , of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"Show that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded in favour or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"It's another planet of apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans to build Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Valley of Temecula, the Mahmoud Harmoush magnet has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together without problems in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse that he rented in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a surface of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
The opponents can still appeal to the municipal council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes her something very peculiar, although little is missing to be a truly 'alienian' type of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the Science publication on Thursday.
For a long time, there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after substituting phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar pointed out, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbial discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose details of the discovery, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes show is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential to life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by the other in biochemistry and the basic biochemistry structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not done by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Therefore, it may be difficult for the organisms to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is different enough to not work as well as the phosphorus, so it enters and, to say it somehow, appeals to the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbi grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can prove that it can live with arsenic instead poses the possibility that there may naturally be a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the early eras of the Earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not only the way life was formed on Earth anciently," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs were found missing in Compton.
The two dogs missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel have been found, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, as noted by the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday evening, according to reports Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions planned for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the virtually two-month tours of the couple participating in canine competitions.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer kid, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether to give a reward or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge from New York officially approved the creditors' "pre-arm" plan to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of movies and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM relaunching under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million, to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and firm recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy more than 140 study creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors sought.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan which, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a $4 million "success honoraries".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and gathered an annual tableboard of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your gift budget
While iPad is the main candidate to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mold in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99-dollar BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes decorated with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toys salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are stuffed toys of the size of a cobayo who sing a note when their belly tightens.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking borrowed from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animator doll plays turnover games like Simóm says, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with blocking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a boy from the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a ride by car into a session with a notebook of self-correction exercises occurring.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important pointing of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, 3-7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and electronic books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The aim is to set up words by putting the blocks in line before time ends; it is formidable for an improvised competition of arming words.
They are increasingly the toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the online code, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Lightly larger than the pig of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microrobots driven by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a block maze to see if you can find the way out.
It's also lasting.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of maintaining order in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a square in the city, inspecting seriously the nervous people in his charge, emitting orders in a quiet voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent policemen of China's urban order, feared and despised by their energetic capricious measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of viewers.
"Sign!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely spent adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, dishonestly.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating glance: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart dish, and observed it with a constant frustrated tide for half an hour, until the street seller picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, expressly elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the coarse police a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these city squads.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of Hubei Province killed a passenger after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively scourging offenders without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street seller suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," regretted China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleansing."
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial traits."
They should have a height above average, more than 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of female candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female Chengguans are like flowerers, he said, and added, "In addition to being flowerers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial traits.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
"We can't let a lame person or a jorobado come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a Sardinian look.
His 21-year-old co-worker, Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also do not oppose their work in time, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply frighten vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pans or cups as possible before being thrown.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his biked car with noodles garrisons.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of vendors.
They can only threaten to denounce the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, ravaged after the false rumor spread that some Chengguan officers had killed a seller.
More than a dozen Chengguan policemen or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were turned on or on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their arms to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign.
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have expelled Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that emerged from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobby for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate by 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national holders last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly happy" for the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this subject."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have plotted to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
The interviews, emails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 at the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law to lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for their public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct of procedure.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in the attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said it had no proof enough to prove that money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy is an important company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, which obtained work through lobby thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbist, Ensign's chief of cabinet John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was "matching" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told the journalists that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude his investigation.
" Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
One minute a minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written documents to the court that outline the arguments of appeals that will probably occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by journalists of mass media, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exercise inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom will affect the individual's rights to have a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense lawyer for Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was carried by the passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrity cases may generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historical judgment of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime was believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them scary photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But your arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were continually firing fire from emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to the Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludita vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appellate courts were often attracted by the adjustment arguments required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressuring for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civicism set up a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has triggered a little civicism in Washington.
Is it a presagio of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences of the two sides, as well as an acknowledgement of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the President's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, surveying each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
A reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections raise supportive passions, which are then extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, in particular those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are over at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment allowance for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He claimed, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfil their promises to cut state spending and override the new health law.
These support lines are already clearly observed in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission, including the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and retirement age, and the cut in expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have handled one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officers elected on the panel, suggesting that there are, at least now, few foundations or desires for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first one will happen next year in the form of supportive shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partyism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partisanism and polarization are now greater than they were in the middle of the 1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of the Congress that was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more important election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points in the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that he collects directly from Kremlin, as reported in February by the US Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes its part as the money goes up on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blamed him for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several claims for release on such accusations.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, he said: "It's madness, a scam, a mess."
According to surveys, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is unheard that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more as a cleptocrat than a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means "weather" or protection) passed by the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and militia are on second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS raises the money from larger companies, and that the police point to small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that the best thing is to get protection from MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (the countries are classified from less to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the American Embassy's note, which did not happen until late at night Moscow hour, will probably cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite the fact that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a specific classroom, weakly illuminated, with stained and outdated walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemeres.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrendered to the government, long lasting loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemers, condemning the former head of the known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Jemeres, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Cambodian Red Jemeres, between 1975 and 1979, some 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and their military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that gave up in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Red Jemers began to desert towards the government, culminating in the renditions of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemeres fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemeres elite officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for depopulating their weapons, standard soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have obtained few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Center, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone food."
"But now life is difficult because we have to supply ourselves."
The current Red Jemers court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to begin to prosecute Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jemers.
The mandate of the court is to prosecute the principal leaders and those who are most responsible for the crimes, but he has not said whether he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a land road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She claimed that if the court had convened it, it would not be presented.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, young people from Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemeres, despite the link of the city to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers preserve a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by a oxidized roof of leafboard.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell salesman at the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its arms-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus were carried out in the last two months to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and the low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of withdrawing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that travelled over 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the task, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distension.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not make reparations to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make reparations to the CIA's flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram by the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cable) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, there was a meeting between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no redress for intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unprepared pills," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then Foreign Head, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, as it was in the hands of the judges, the government had limited capacity to influence."
For its part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminatory elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 at lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to reduce the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action on this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the US that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," he says.
The confessor complained on the "August" network of being a mother
The young lady was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he employs from childhood, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the Coruñés people from which she is native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know your sentimental life, that ABC rebuilds through testimonies from your family.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, he soon learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
He didn't take long to meet him with another bridegroom.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came with her for a week to Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it seems that their romance broke, they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and she writes: "Alberto is very rare and mushroomed, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do whatever he wants."
Then talk about a message to the phone you just received, "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If she doesn't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back," she argues.
In May, he talks about the return to his people: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be until 19, because 20 I have to introduce myself to a job to not lose it."
Make it clear that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever think of leaving it with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When he typed it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was supposed to be killed on the 10th, was supposed to be dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Majorca.
"He'll go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so save me some canguro pasta."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss of Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the e-mail, look how when he wants to find me, you gotta fuck yourself."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, your current partner, there's one: "He's ahead of me money."
On the internet there are his messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the ex-prisoner."
"Terror of the Galician (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, the jury, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the Judiciary Detention Centre in Menorca.
Counsel, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts occurred, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PPP already has the view on the general elections as, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training obtains in these elections tends to double the number that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomics of 2006, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the fidelization of the PP's electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate date will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its relevo to the head of the Barcelona Diputación, one of the administrations that manages most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and people agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists will not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be disgraceful if this formation lost its representation in the Barcelonan Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to lead the turn in the Tarraconan capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they were found on several occasions.
Populars have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al-Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detainees by police officers in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al-Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the author of the last bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Campai operation" the Al-Qaida counterfeiting apparatus has been "deactivated" at the international level and, therefore, "their operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Al-Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence other European police units have participated in the investigations in addition to the Thai services, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory they will take place in the next few days similar strikes to the one that took place last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asgar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another one was developed in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones running the cell located in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of males between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is stressed that, for the time being, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended with the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the fiscal concert
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas her conditions to support her investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that is summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and without philosopher adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to put forward in the equator of her mandate.
The president of the Catalan people went to Artur Mas's meeting with the security of having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than enough to make him want, as the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations that will hold the opposition to abstain in the poll of investidura.
A possible understanding with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to hold in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the time being, the talks that these days hold with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as far as the President of the PP is concerned, in order to support an investigation, "it will have to park all the sovereign and independentist speeches," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do share their commitment to the loss of the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's investment will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measurement"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their beaver would kill more than 11 elders
Those responsible for the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who was there employed killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, counsel Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil perpetrators".
And in addition to the social disrespect that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the sealer in time, the great threat to La Caritat is now in the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the automobile that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent out by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, rejected this extreme utterly yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action on the part of any other person other than the accused himself".
He already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and explained that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 by, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is complicated to check that the staff at the center have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his efforts to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the lab that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she hung them inside by giving them bleach as she has already confessed to the three women she killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the celer, not even to the number of confessional murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the extent of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that he warned "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The peripheral differentials have been tightly closed and the stocks of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake, and the euro has barely pointed out what is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is a illegitimate market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be withdrawn tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary long-term liquidity measures and leaving unlimited access only on a weekly basis.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that they will extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal of intensifying it.
If you do not meet the expectations generated, you will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if you continue to withdraw liquidity measures, God helps us!
As at their May meeting at which they claimed that they had neither contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market feeling following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still has insufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension in the face of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations in Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple than in March, to very expensive types and closes access to Sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being, it seems so."
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The temporal does not amaze in the open conflict in the family Alvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, in considering it as a "full rule", the Judiciary Board of El Enebro on the 16th day, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors he was discarded by five of his seven children who were appointed managers at the shareholders' assembly of 18 January this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Trade Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th day, convened by the Magistrate of Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the thunder box within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants his five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitate the radically null and void board of 18 January", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the board has been held, it will proceed to its challenge in its view that it is a "full rule".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the matter of substance to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its story in this select speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a new arrival shield and, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship, they all bet on the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso triumph.
Without deserving the ability as the pilot of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German placed on the market in 2007 for far removed purposes from the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design chains of assembly of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before realizing it, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or the most famous utility cars in Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the shields in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
On Red Bull's team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, equipped with powerful computers, to analyze and project all sorts of changes in the ballads.
Siemens' manager explained that PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's ballads with the exception of the engine, which is of Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological refinement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-tech factory to design and produce its wardrobes in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task is 580 people, including their two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is null and void.
The factory's head of technology, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology is 85% of the success, while drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in collaboration in Barcelona yesterday is its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president, Helena Herrero, set an example of the refurbished shop located in the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and handles the design of exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of commerce aims "to improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneering pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computers under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'robbing' a million clients to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, Bank Sabadell's delegate advisor, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but initially rule out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse of the interest margins, which will be tried to compensate in part with increases in fees and credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private clients, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 with a three-year duration.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to resort to FROB's public aid, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are disregarded -, their large outstanding subject, as it had so far mimiced SMEs and companies more than the retail client.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the austerity stake in productivity, or the same, with cost reductions as an objective, and the challenges of which will be presented by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks dare at this time to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world's banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima director plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the emergence of the crisis in Spain will "be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the debt war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to his network to limit the credit in the long term and raise the price of the differentials - see FiveDays of November 22 and 27.
He also recognized that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "it will require larger sizes."
"Everything's gonna move next year," he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "great up" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can provide the market with funds for new recapitalisations.
Having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he underscored what some bankers already claim to be a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rests, thereby damaging the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that a wave of mergers of savings funds will occur and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director-general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"Most is completely done; we may go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated greatly in that too," the manager pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast by the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is taking place "at the highest speed possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place in the time frames that, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
"Passing 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no constellation in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are quite unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who questioned it.
The manager pointed out that, at the current economic juncture, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "important" concentration process and that "is going as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoe and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of help to unpaid unemployed, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do you interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another nut turn in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is at odds with maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of hand to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour and stability plans in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practising.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel pennilessly extended Greece's rescue decision.
He was then the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published it were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even though we now have to take action with which he may not agree very well, from that date the old operation of the euro will have been completed.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offender countries will be severely punished, they can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another debt-based and construction-based alternative, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The envoy is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand.
It is not just about regaining the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity window they've given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifestation (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that must be put in order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are being contemplated, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone that is too struggling with unserious countries cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Treats like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but will not escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly driven by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match contested on November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is unsportable or not and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which your team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in making mistakes to cause the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the liguilla, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and with various economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the discussion that emerged in the reported case is because it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presume of nobility and honor, and which on past occasion has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his extended history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate focuses on whether such behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are committed by law fraud; since they are indeed actions respectful of the sport regulations, but they seem to circumvent their meaning.
The issue goes on to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, an aspect that with these actions did not jeopardize, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that you refer to with the clean game is to prevent the team of offenders from taking advantage unfairly of the opposing team, which didn't happen either.
Now, the paradoxical of the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not fit into what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hid to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most evident to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They gladly waited and accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders obtain in the intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not disadvantaged or profitable in the same party, since obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team can be eliminated to the first change, and in addition with this performance the players meet a penalty match and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the card accumulation suspension occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favour making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case we are concerned, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without redressing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to cause them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to pick up Christmas dinners from groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
The self-supported celebrations by employees, which want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferated.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December also come back the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to a price-adjusted offensive to be able to catch the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the employers and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (when the New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As it has already happened since 2008, when the weak cow phase began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budget issue.
To avoid tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, one and the other demand battle prices, the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to predict how the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think about it long before booking."
"He wants to get out but he's got the warnings on in the price theme," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom of billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day at the level of groups of friends that pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisures of Barcelona), her vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that all the reservations are "lived", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is, the illusion for the feasts has not come down, pay whoever pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks' leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for uncovering in Washington.
This is listed by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoured dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "fruitful", argues: "Property is often non-existent; aid offers remain unresponsive or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear" the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red wing" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, but dates from November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day that the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called notice network free to proceed with an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been willing to respond by videoconferencing to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunting, not a legal persecution," the Missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an undetermined place an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was demonstrated yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridical and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told the CNN chain.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to undermine Assange's importance contrasts with opinions these days proclaiming conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower chamber from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and to pursue anyone who makes any contribution or help to them."
Even further has Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, gone, who has had to retreat after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former ruler of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said in the Fox chain.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guineas close to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to pick up the thirteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation love is insufficient for those associated with ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can at all cause the headbreakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, Esquerra's leader will try to beat the new critics with guineas that will allow him to arm himself up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
By means of paperboards, and not by hand lift.
If the Carodists want to carry a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good either "to Bulgarian".
The closest to Carod demand that the president put his office at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercos controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But in the absence of the majority enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document to be put to the vote of the national council on 18.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercos in exchange for this promise to advance the congress by the autumn of 2011, something that the dome already gives as its way.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "poliphony" damages stability and that its aim is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty traps of doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the conseller in office Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació gave the fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recommended" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces that come from the related sector to Carod.
The second can be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly once as an operating mechanism.
It therefore advocates a reform of the statutes to allow the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 convulsionary conclave left the commission to the directorate to review assemblyism at a specific congress on statute reform.
This quotation is still pending, as the internal tide of the past few years has been advising not to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical stalking sectors, it can be a good time to regain it and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO Mexico State, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the container of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are that of three women and the finding of a couple of bodies closed in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime were added.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm shots and the grace shot on his head as well as his feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a car abandoned on Mixtecas Street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday morning, four ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan quota motorway of Sal, in the section crossing the municipality of Villa Guerrero.

A day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man, was killed with eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were finalized with a bullet impact on the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot on the forehead was found the body of a man on a lonely road to the Colony El Naranjo and underneath the body they found a percutted shell with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Golondrina Beach colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse found at the Peña Colorada site, which was tied from the hands back and with the head tied.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to be involved in shelters and abandoned in the van of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, together with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On 17, wrapped in shelters, two women were found without life in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning was located the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow shelter with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the woman's skin, tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found on a car in Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with the incinerated head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied to feet and hands, two bodies were found inside a abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín colony's Justice Center.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Cologne Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a cartridge with a message.
Maintains China's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and stated that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It made it clear, however, that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these sections, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives set out in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it abounded, they are in progress or have already concluded a number of multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government, and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations, the Government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent spotlights to savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientist advisor to that country's government on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than it is generally thought of.
For example, he said, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years, and plans to do another by 2020, it abounded.
Applicable to legality expulsion from Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP explained that the former Panist leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to the taking of protest by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to refer, where appropriate, through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never on the negotiating table an alliance for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not so far, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The Panist leader specified that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; when we count "we enjoy and strengthen us," he said.
He said that the council will certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the next controversy, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations."
As he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four-year framework of his government, César Nava called on the PRIsts to reflect on the sexeniums of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Calderon; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to adopt this legislation," the President of the State tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act law, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to adopt this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyberlink with a broader document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vow expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice listen," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government financing are approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point at that and then we can plan the rest of the sequence," he said.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when supportive organizations of the project are leading an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger on the wound
The second round of the pleasures of the language was a walk where the participants galaized the narrative
"That of The Sex in the Language I understand it but... the finger in the Sore? What is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time she used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "it puts us in pain", the Argentine writer sweetly spit on the audience, mostly of young people, who was quoted at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "call" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers even if she does find clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectious comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that titled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but is discovered at one time.
With brushes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorcerer, who touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that had lost a maid, a narrative that turned to talk later America, the great novel to which he did not lack from the beginning his own chronists who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what the conquering captains told.
"Bearers who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking until they could."
However, he highlighted "the crazy and the embusters are the ones who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
It's actually called "cervantine tradition."
"By your inheritance we are what you tell."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero welcomed and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers to the great wound of social violence that her country is going through - and she shares Latin America - as a result of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit compromise that of course is not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the owners of our thought and to be the owners of reality we have to matize: and to matize means often putting the finger on the wound and disturbing those people who are much more comfortable thinking of cartoon, in white and black, in established and unmatched ideas and also disturbing the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special to him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting with the sub-campeon's medal, he has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive endings.
The Santista strategist arrived at his first final as a coach at the Opening Tournament 2002, when he was carrying the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by a global of 4-2 before Toluca; later, at the Clausura 2003 he also came to the decisive duel and also lost him with a global of 3-1 and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenary Tournament 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 before the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penaltis band he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the voltereta 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the evil and to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and therefore the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helm when he questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous end, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the arbitrator whistles the end we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two criminals for throwing we were already ready to run and I think that's a teaching, until the party is finished we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because you trust your players: "One never seeks to get to the criminal band, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad move the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we left, that left us something for this end that we hope not to reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technician under champion and try for the first time the glory given by the titles.
EU changes rules for obtaining visa
People should go to Visa applicant Service centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, it will change the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take the applicant's biometric information, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the messaging service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and take their prints.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

You'll announce NASA's extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that were thought to be inhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they would become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbi that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of surviving and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "yes there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will make known the real scope of the findings at tomorrow's Thursday press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), in the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Management PRD, PT, Convergence and Sponsor 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins 'bipartidism', because now it will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be ravaged again by both parties and with that the opposing coalition ended.
"So far it came (the opposing coalition), that's what I look at, because we're excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress after being monopoly, now be "duopoly."
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is an eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues and partners to become more, the convergent abounded.
Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that Congress was currently becoming a 'bott' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a party, now they're splitting it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked for respect for the personality of the Member, given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by cupular agreements, let us leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more goes out for "the supplier"
Pays Mazatlán City Council another check to the questioned owner of the company of electrical material.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, for the amount of 200 thousand 144,56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favour of this provider, which was observed by the State High Auditor for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still due and therefore how many more checks are missing to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, he is simply being paid what he owes, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury assured that they have not reused their services.
The above, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a revision to the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and to reverse the evils found by tourists with new activities or routes.
He said the bad condition of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn him back to nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and they have no idea of the money that's lost, or otherwise they didn't do the works in so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the City Council's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venetian of Mazatlán.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleansing on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given due attention and this kind of fact reveals something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put on line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that we will have to order first, clean up and put on line to make them attractive so that they can be added to the inventory that we have to promote to the destination."
Calls for IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A Legislature of work worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsionate Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three members of the New Alliance Party, two members of the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, totalling 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to make a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly premiered 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges he faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival compars of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to bring the Governor forward in turn.
"We worked for them to come to do a decent work and especially committed to society and sectors because it was the Synaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow promote employment generation."
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourism projects and help to give security to the state and update to the Alcohols Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
He's looking for a magician king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chivo.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family inhabits a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"We sometimes see her hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old Joseph Alfredo aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would want this monster', but I said 'we're going to see son', because it was very expensive," he sadly remembered Cayetana.
For older children, those who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, uses size eight.
Joseph John, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a couple of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help to him.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign Find a Magic King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out in the context of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various accusations.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants have been seized, four kilos of ache, money and equipment destined for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in Sherbrooke's justice palace within the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of production of Cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, plotting and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests," says Mr Ruel.
This police operation involved some seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Fight against clandestine migration without problems
The draft Conservatives Act which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the motherlands loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite you're stepping on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for the arrest of up to one year of any person coming from a ship identified as the transport of clandestine immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, apparently, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that his party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that action will be taken against those responsible for clandestine parenting, and that is what we intend to do with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives Bill because it attacks refugees and imprisones children for at least a year," explains Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell the deputies that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a philosopher."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request the holding of a vote so that each opponent would later be explained to his or her constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimousness
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption unit and the collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation has been a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, the Tuesday announcement has surprised more than one.
It should be said that during a permanent meeting of the Council on Quebec police services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the party's critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of the chissette" and "a last-minute cunning solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the CSQ president, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest is obsessed with avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this stalemate, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general intervener to carry out a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling individuals to testify.
The creation of a permanent grid is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the Marteau Prosecutor, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorbike groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa encouraged the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfalls that have been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Maurice.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road sunk.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls add to the snow melting that had already accumulated in certain sectors, various rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged an interim bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains alert and monitors the situation closely, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Crescent Prevision Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blamed Dupont
Quebec Stéphane Dupont's radio presenter has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians, as well as their rude language on radio.
The CCNR believes that Mr Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts throughout the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints in relation to comments made in emissions disseminated between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Submitters should provide reliable data rather than misleading.
In relation to suicide, Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee believes that the episodes questioned by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Any blame has therefore been dismissed in this regard.
The last litigation concerned statements made following the Haitian earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had led to a media confrontation that had raised numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the broadcaster, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and Thai box, goes up to the world's tamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"In this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to strike with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will certainly go to the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Quebec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
A consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor is located in the centre of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts, which has obtained without a prior invitation to tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for an amount of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Quebec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Party to follow, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to price increases.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of secretly doing it, now do it openly," said the Party's deputy yesterday, Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "unhonestly" and "with a lack of rigour."
He pointed out that the "minimum" would be for the QP to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, this is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been awarded without competition being put into play; it has been a negotiation.
Moreover, the consortia formula has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortia formula in the technical advice sector is undergoing an investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's business record allows to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Quebec specifically responds to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has provided an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account his participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the contract of Ennergie gérance of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
Consumers are barely confident of the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trademarks and green certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumers are immersed in a media universe where they pululate messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regret the lack of reliable information and believe that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, the Quebequens seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not rely on the environmental commitment of the companies or the environmental advertising of the companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates carrying the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "corresponsible", the Barometer points out.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebeccans take political speeches seriously on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the doubtful nature of the information cause 46 per cent of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, following the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebequens say they also distrust the alleged yields of the organic products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in the shops in your neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in your region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the position of the king of recycling which attempts to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social consciousness seems to be doorways (of your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebequenses indicated that they have used public transport or shared car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were waiting for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to rebuy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex in the Saint-Laurent boulevard and return his true kinetic vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has agreed to engage in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, referred a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any event, it appears that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of the owners of cinema rooms and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinema rooms.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector are claiming considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to fidelize its client.
Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, drive a private financing campaign, hoping to gather $700,000 to open their way to acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films on eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group feel about the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted together...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the U.S., but at the same time reflects the U.S.'s feeling of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-US relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details that really contain substantial.
A cable on 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal electoral campaign, tells how far the United States does not enter the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Hence, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "sorting silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he feels, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will first register a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from replacing it or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series spread at the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out strong interrogations.
Another cable tells that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the mood has been warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by a quantity that corresponds to almost one third of the additional decrease to be made to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancún to offset the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diodes bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG issued on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should be further reduced to stabilize by 2020 the increase in temperatures in two degrees centigrade to avoid decontrol.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be implemented in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they don't contain any mercury.
Various specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted by incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and $8 million in tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal plants whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results immediately," stresses a spokesperson for the head of the UN.
"Call all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline of Wednesday to midnight without the results published, three days from Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CEI president had commented on the television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo side has had the constitutional council annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast president's campaign, has stated that the intimidation manoeuvres of the voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the ancient rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results as "inadmissible" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the guinea to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes versus 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who was publicly supported by former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the temporary seasonal variations (CVE) published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the active population in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, be available or not in the two weeks to work and seek or not work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new rise in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including MWDs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4 per cent in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure of 6.6 per cent with MWDs.
Unemployment has only been stable between 25-49 years of age, with 8.3 per cent in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8 per cent throughout France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its methods of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to persecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, otherwise it is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told the AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprison one of their closest people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
In the context of this dossier, it is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The instructor magistrate has taken account of the explanations and released him," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night to Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking in influences and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "sustraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social property".
Among the people facing Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whiten the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator arrested in Iran for "spionage", has had in vilo the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the close look of the United States diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens who are forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "leave continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
Everything to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, " silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatory manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactics: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss' prison (which will take place on August 16, on the day when he will be refugee at the French embassy) "will demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like numerous observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier ensures that it did not.
Eliseo states, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "straight" surveillance of French information services.
Eliseo's counselor marks a telephone number, he hangs up and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not spare effort, uses communiqués and "flights" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
Because of such "gratitude" to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Eliseo to give foot to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been squeezed out of premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praises that it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusts him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But we have thanked you anyway."
"At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot."
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called Cinderella that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as indicated by government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then they find it hard to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerially responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, it is necessary.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the responsible.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free software to limit the time to connect to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
Worldwide 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints on Thursday the world's Copas organizing countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can become a priority over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) bears witness to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a Worldwide.
Transactions between frames, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, a football cradle, which only hosted the Worldwide once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has revealed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who have been thrown into an intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government looks forward to re-editing the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012 for London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's brightness before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (Multiary of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Cup of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're pulling out their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first global economic power and headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project, seems to be taking advantage.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World to China, earnestly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of the TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by the European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had understood that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One term in Eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be re-appointed in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometimes in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it is dealing with the UMP Members on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
He was just transmitting the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidentials, with a joking tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Do not think that I will not plant what will come next."
His earlier statements do not come any closer to the candidacy, nor do they.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the palestra that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people from the PS to claim that the battle is organized before planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's nomination to Nicolas Sarkozy's nomination (46 per cent versus 44 per cent, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he immediately and wisely reacted to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for the exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
Because of the crisis of European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt emission institute will certainly not be allowed to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in solving the debt crisis of the European States.
He did not mean whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme of purchasing State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
On the eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer eloquent as to his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State Letters on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury obligations has doubled last week to about EUR 1.350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have purchased Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to profitable and lasting conditions ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I can't imagine he's going to modify his program considerably."
"If not, it would risk causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," he anticipates on his side Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
As regards interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations in order to keep the market stable," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of market investors and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile states," an important debt manager said yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put on the clouds, States will have even more problems with reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi captivates the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy-risk coverage contracts (CRQs) had been fired to 263 basis points, causing a certain upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulences" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under review in the Senate is based on a figure of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (compared with 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budget provisions can be applied after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will need to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD head economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of decision-making would not be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis control mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already shown Sunday, night and day that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European States' obligations has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the debt rating of Portugal, the most common target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "the political rhythm is much slower than the pace of markets."
Conscious of this hiato and the dangers it hides, the European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the crisis already in place.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collider (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first EFSF titles will be issued next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative has entrusted Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional IMF direct commitment.
With regard to the front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move along a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid, at all costs, calling for international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms which they consider indispensable to increase confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, lastly, consider the options available to accelerate the process of standardisation of public debt markets.
Passing through Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to redeploy the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional amount of around EUR 100,000 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has 60 billion euros.
A council that could certainly be examined in detail by European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 orange alert departments
Snowfalls continue to cause difficulties in circulation, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also slightly snows in the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Baja Normandía, Isle of France and Lemosín.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause movement difficulties and affect some economic activities, Metéo France alerts.
In Côte d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the movement on the secondary network in Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it be driven only if necessary and that certain TER vehicles are prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardía has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "instructs all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested air carriers to cancel 25 per cent of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to the expected snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the Isle of France has reached its peak, it rains billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of 4 billion euros.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be the sum that will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrections Finance Act, which was discussed in the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the plans to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the Isle of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and devote this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would this method get?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's away from 4 billion.
"It is stated that tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds to be mobilized by the State and will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project advances," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment you create income (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used according to requirements."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised did not appear in the credit, could lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and envisages a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculing profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished investigations (or do not know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little desire) the head of secret services (if it couldn't be, I know, editor of Liberation), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the American Embassy of Rome to the Department of State was the same as the Newsweek published last week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a revolt?
On the one hand, they only say what every grown person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of State can call on the phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centers.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly, we just seem to know that we don't know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "punishers".
But let us enter the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the Orwell era, it could be conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, visited hotel, taken highway, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer hold its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a poster on the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential conversations cannot be expected on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at the very least, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept, in one copy, in closed drawers with keys: in the end, the attempted espionage of the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently progressing as a crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the cableless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a cable (telephonic) telegraph.
Video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a movie step by step, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) only allow progress or backwards from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques will take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what was secretly planned in the embassies.
The embassies are currently asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's whims in its pledges of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-start or early-start pledges made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French chapuzas have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union undertook to contribute €7.2 billion in three years and €1.260 million in France (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each of them chooses the reference that is best suited to it.
For example, the European Commission has made reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years are added for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, France's total aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (frequently, projects related to emission reduction based on more efficient technologies), it is impossible to present a euro that is to be recovered as an equivalent to a donated euro... At the very least, only the cost of the loan to the loan country should be calculated for its commitments (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France finds no such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it at 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respects their commitments to 100 per cent grants.
In other words, when most of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is doing a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Using just 36.1 million euros, he gets the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems Bercy has dealt with arbitration) could have a two-fold negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of more sand in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move forward the discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old eats in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years consumes in four meals and a tentempié a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as candy, were examined in the laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as potential or likely cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances susceptible to acting as endocrine disturbers (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Research Centre on Cancer.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially canceric pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association points out.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three considered safe cancers, as well as about 20 residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, foreseen as a bakery for school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicid prohibited in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were fed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "polluter cocktails" for the consumer is "probably underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "to deal with the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
