The victory of the populist right in Austria, together form 29 %
The pre-election to the Austrian parliament has brought, according to the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously tampered with.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares for his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, thus losing a 5.5 percent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse has still finished the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party's president and, until today, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of electoral results, that is, the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have earned about 18 percent and BZO, 11 percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the people negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a penalty on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution, Haider is clearly betting who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already returning to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also succeeded in reaching parliament, although it has slightly lost and declined from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and is therefore not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India Can Cold
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be achieved, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not solved then yes, then it would certainly reach this cooling," he noted after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished by a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years' imprisonment, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then you can request the release of the case and wait free for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then it would be possible for pardon," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support has already been obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, before her colleague, she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister circumvented the answer to the question as to whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received enough promises," he only found.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I am approaching an electronic wall map, representing Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this workflower and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides up to now a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms up to now that in themselves bear the key to developing anticancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land firm
Coastal countries have today begun to quarrel vehemently the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed on in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
"Simply, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Border, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The committee has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also succeeded - the seabed surface that the commission granted last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains in their study.
The gain resulting from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do it until the ten years since they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends, the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," says director Mikulka emphasizing, adding "that their separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The background there is accident, it's kind of like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German Special Forces Command was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the Special Forces Command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are increasingly known.
According to data from the ministry of defense and the ministry of the interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
The German army specialists and GSG 9, federal police aircraft squad, of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, were therefore present at the place of release, as well as experts in the logistics field of the technical charity institution.
As the spokespersons of the ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need themselves because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on site.
"Fortunately, that was not the time," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had abducted a group of travellers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping of the hostages in the southern Egyptian desert region, they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve of the salvation package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has barely failed a large saving package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives with 227 votes against 206 rejected the government package to save financial markets.
Despite all the appeals by President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince the critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic Negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for that was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
The adoption of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary to allow the programme to enter into force.
Organizers recorded an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened juncture the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison with the same period last year.
According to the investigation by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results are based on GfK figures that are the information analyzed on bookings in 1200 travel agencies and computers approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are of great demand, DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
The Germans' preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneary, the beer in jars of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blonde, the moderator on TV and she wears a custom-made traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering especially because I'm in Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to perform their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado, everything isn't so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be listening or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird eyes next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A picnic draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "The left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is a widow. "
Or God, now I cling back to the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods to flirt and wear hats where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionistic way is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous," which he pronounces with a "or" very long.
He tells me after he put his glass next door of a liter of beer he's finished drinking.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren't very lucky and they can't consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, health groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear each time in group - suddenly there are always four people who bring covered walks from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: Sober, drunk come back.
You don't see who suffers the degrees of alcohol and is in the walks.
"They are the ones who "can't do it anymore," a health care provider responded to my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate within this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps in Asia, one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition is found.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to lay the end of the platforms and carries in front of two towers, one for each corner, looking all like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decaying.
But once the vault locker was over, there's no doubt what the company's greatness was that this was the westernest door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that healed up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what Saudi Arabia is today.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low
the British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917, a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has decayed and remained aside from history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a litter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, thought to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power paddles" where middle-class managers in business costumes - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I brought, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time towards the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not for one or the other.
You have to do both things.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "can Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "doesn't want to face that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost from memory: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, largely, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal of the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then, there are no many doubts that the continent will be to claim this fascinating country.
Life to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (quela, 11 September) was responsible for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Guildford and the Choir.
As part of the music project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21, but at the time the Proteus sang its ending in 1979, several of us were ending the 20 - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing the shapes) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to him, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to that man's inspiration and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us about "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxy, nor too flowery.
Whatever was the music descent, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, for any, been disappointed – otherwise I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in their words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses all over the world."
We'll miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequela by William Woodruff (September 25), you claim that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a PhD."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason that Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew attention to their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to catch magic moments."
Second assault for Honda's supermarkets
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a large habitability, this new monovolume presents an even wider inner space.
In addition to this, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics should be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, we must comment that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation is introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, a country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm commercialized a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to palliate to a large extent the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, markers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 commercialized units, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also hopes to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society takes place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five inches more), its width to 1.69 meters (two inches more) and its distance between axles to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five inches.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and stays at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, internal habitability also increases.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the trunk capacity - which has a double background system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more of the trunk capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are from the version with the 1.4 engine, as the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will have two propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 litres of gasoline.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first mechanics of 1.2 liters gets a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 rounds.
This propellant - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - presents a expenditure of 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, on the basis of the bees' flight, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Safety Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks a lot like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee-composed eyes, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that are up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an aboard microprocessor that immediately translates into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight or higher angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and slowdown, to avoid collisions by the small robot.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so it can function continuously with just a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigs of memory, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new technologies of instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan Vatican will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tiemble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not ingenious.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on rubbish mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created an amenus and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the "hotel of bad credits"... or the troubles.
The thermal aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, you have useful information, but not detailed.
It's more a teenage page than a place for all publics.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something's something, because buying a better house or talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21 % of his capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in his stock exchange.
One week after having discovered an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of ordinary shares Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79 percent to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status, " explained John Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its book value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the profit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred titles into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at more than 47 dollars or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capitals contributed by MUFG will allow him to take on investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group refused, however, to give clarifications on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had greatly relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange quote drop in half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost went back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced having raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, as an example of his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64 % of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80 % of suffrage.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7 % of the suffrage were zero votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the suffrage plus one.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out on the departure of the electoral centres and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to "yes", estimated at 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians leading the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated for Chávez and Morales but also for his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will develop in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in State power over the economy, reserving the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through foreign currency sent by its migrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, who can carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in the country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
I finally envisage the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 persons abducted have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanies abducted ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 15H30 on board a special plane to the Al Maza military base adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were transported immediately by helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are well-healthed" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all lands in one desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zul to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
One Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the Special Forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of shots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled, " said the one responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also lied about the payment of a ransom.
On the eve the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an offshore on board of which the kidnappers were found, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silenced majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and takes up the current electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and his heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only Chinon's castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to search in history, to preserve with little money lots of private archives and to preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Member States of the Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian- Dutch bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis in the US market: the three countries will support in total 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition officer.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a certain sense be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will buy about half (49 per cent) of the Bank's property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including, above all, the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' actions started a strong decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with their 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company's shares fell by 12 percent only on Friday, being this the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the stock value has declined with more than two thirds.
Noting the current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's leadership attributed the sharp fall of Fortis' stocks to the insecurity of the American market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the stocks already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new head of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors had no reason to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken farm
In the United States, life and health insurance companies are often refusing to sign a insurance contract when they see the drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in all cases connects the use of prescription data to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the fox chickenman" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status depend and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical checkup and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the checkup.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the client's identification number he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's diseases and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the fat level in your blood is virtually incurably high, this is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the program, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are little difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for patient approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they did not receive a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and by linking them with drug consumption data they get more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more company has access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill granting the authority for the control of specialized companies for the supply of personal data is now before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: hence he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the supply of his own personal data.
It is another issue that the person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most global areas, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal primarily with nuclear cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator about whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Charge, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, chief foreign policy representative, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase their trade exchange to more than one hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus, they legally harmonized the 26 existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and pressed the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides have great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will adhere to its energy and climate programme, i.e. until 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, just as the climate conference next year should reach a global agreement and decrease by 2050 with fifty percent of greenhouse gas production.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will receive commissions worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

It will follow a meeting with the stamp in the Room Struktur in the pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospectives about the state of the publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books of foreign authors gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire missing a year ago.
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the desert of Nevada.
The debris have been found on an altiplano at 3000 meters altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, in the confinement between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a stamp conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been killed in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is own of Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the confinement of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes house.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had conquered a position in history thanks to a long series of primes.
In 2002, to the sixth tentative, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostic balloon: two solo weeks of flight.
Three years later, I had turned the world on a plane and no scales.
Among his record, also that for flying at 15,445 meters di altitude, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and specified angles.
It is this, in summary, Glk the last born among the trucks all terrain "compatible" from the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Own by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls since the 17th of October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the main street of the Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until 15 November.
The premium phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in tridimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, to recomposition itself in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automobile communication.
Will you be able with this formula to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
De Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia a small group (small units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia have been added.
They have three-coloured flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night have been removed so that they are not identified.
The English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fans, those from Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all with names, so easily controlled.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, none who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand any further in a stadium.
Fortunately!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We must immediately turn off this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
That is why, "very open eyes" especially in view of the party of the National on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italy supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also count on a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm lifted during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria non is a reaction ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that he was formerly from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not rehearsal to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans who have been embarrassed.
"I do not do the sociologist – adds the number 1 of the Observatory – the rehearsals are attributed in the countries in which the fact occurs.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's hymn: they too are not a reaction, but if they allow either they are of education..."
