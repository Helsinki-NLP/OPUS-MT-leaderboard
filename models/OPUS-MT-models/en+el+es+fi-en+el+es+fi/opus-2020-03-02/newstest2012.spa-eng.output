Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the release of the ex-Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantaged agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not yet final, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it's about determining whether it's moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of warring tribes, will join by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably it did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is no longer surprising that Islamic fighters would accept the help of unbelievers.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO's attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is served by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem with expelling the "crossed"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get the Libyan black gold in good words alone?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may eventually be that the West may presume to protect human rights.
As long as the Sharia followers don't cross us.
A New Age of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting the investor search engine
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical cabinets of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent expected, France's 0.4 per cent
Both countries have made the data of the second quarter public, while in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of expected 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to ČSÚ the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is complied with.
The results are even worse than the forecasts of analysts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen annually by 5.2 per cent.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bonds at ten years are maintained by 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany there are voices that say that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the European Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team performs the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant doorman Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, defended fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second half.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team to the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two party injured were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the quotation of the European Cup, so the arks of national football will get a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first few minutes, a good offensive game was given.
Both teams were committed to keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the countryside.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicked to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With his gesture, they want to express their support for his country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students started praying Tuesday at noon before the facilities and then chorused death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students trained on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology centre in which uranium works.
They seek to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, strives to achieve nuclear weapons.
There is talk in Israel about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the purpose of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the centre of Isfahan but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and supper embroidered
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity 5 per cent.
Obese children come in most families with a non-healthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is demonstrated again the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
On the table, obsessed children feed, for example, at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program " obesity is not a coincidence".
In the families of overweight children, there is no habit of sports, which applies to most of the current families, where only 15 per cent of the children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 children in basic education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "The obesity of not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th grade.
An adequate diet and fairly exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," he collects one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with supper sausage
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details, which also count, are important, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that 10 percent of the households don't eat anything for breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are much more often consumed with unhealthy fries.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet drinks (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are sporting, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Register your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets based on all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy food, are far from ideal."
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet drinks," the study's final report notes.
As a main meal the palm is taken the pasta and closely follows the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive just information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who completed the questionnaire after the completion of the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", an important change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy food", is pointed out in the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for main food and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals maintain
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final examinations are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the big majority.
Someone's cuellicort, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks about how to highlight the body of women of Jennifer Lopez type, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of custom fabric.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothing they feel perfectly is impagable.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or draped.
There are certainly many types of various information and bodies, so I'm happy that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assignment, I've got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to which you must design two costumes: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've got to dress Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming inside, for me is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or look for them on the internet and print them, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, did not only see physically, but also deals with, for example, the product pages in the magazines (of specific themes, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was discussed by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it's all over by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment of dressing in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classically with cowboys and shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it's enough to shove it up and raise the neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That without talking about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more kinds of clothes on the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all different from those used in reality.
All this needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style assume they alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czech Republic, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it must be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will show us a very different size than their real (minor) size.
Then it only remains to gugle and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During his work, he must especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You know how to value people, you don't miss them, you defend their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify him in the dressing room and fill him with beautiful garments, you can't take and throw away everything and say, "Fuck what horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so that someone can put them on," Mario says.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, haircuts, or imperdible. There is also nailon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special garment hooks ahead, if it is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the tissue), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating to professional stylism isn't a pink path, but I don't care exactly what people say.
En Need for Speed: The Run competes throughout America.
Review
A trip, in principle careless, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during tomorrow's shift.
To a certain extent, the expectations were met, but that was no use, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, awakened great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, he appears as a game that should not end up being again a genre of action without more.
We were also curious to know how the inserted scenes would remain, where the main character descends from the car and walks through his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much with regard to what we expected.
There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in total counting points are lost because of absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, errors cannot be called, but rather the incomprehensible deviation of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the steering wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach the first in New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not remotely feel that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to previous delivery of the series.
So, it's nothing from the other world.
But the stroll through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snowy mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, careers are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find yourself a sand storm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of required rivals (normally in a classical race), then you try to earn time (timed classical flat) and then await a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this the police sometimes appear, which does nothing but make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look somewhere else.
But a career designed with enough action suits quite this driving style, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the right driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From such games you can't expect to rebuild complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow on any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only light sprays, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pyrouettes.
Or even it ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can make you feel bad.
The resets are programmed so that when you have an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resettlements are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes it rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent moves forward without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or either slow down.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, without taking into account the time, the same opponent will always advance you on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, whatever price it is.
When it goes ahead of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can papilla the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum suspense and adrenaline doses, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it's a pity, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really matters, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so that it doesn't fit the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will be enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and super-sport exotics for technical driving, for example by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, i.e. there are careers in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing up with profile funds.
At the same time, there is connected an online Autolog function, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you arrive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you get to run darkly along the tracks (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the metro convoy arrives behind you and takes you ahead without more.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none even thought a little bit or if the real authors take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even sovereign.
What a pity that, at the most tense moments, the quality of image is reduced and sometimes severely.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is secured, but prepare because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without a barracks."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenova, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How to not take seriously its motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenova also stressed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing arises is criticism, that if it is insulous, a grey official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained on the basis of the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc's cheese.
Vicenova has also taken care of the agenda followed, followed and followed by the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good disturbance", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which fewer? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, aliens or jargons that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to make greater use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a fame of Eurosceptics and people perceive rather negative aspects than positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is for many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak man comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, "What, have you stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that he does not do any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenova, is awaiting new tough budgetary policies for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real about the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want and those who don't cooperate should stay out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe of the two speeds," Vicenova is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to seek a term that would define IBM's strategy with great accuracy, the most approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has passed 100 years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was placed by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around.
This has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper further in our second century," said during his anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the '30s, was concerned about the care of his employees as Baja's businessman in Czechia (the employees of IBM were the first American operators to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the relationship with the client.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (because it was one of the world's first companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which will replace Palmisano next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working at IBM for 30 years, where she's been head of sales, marquetin and strategies.
In recent years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, the rain of online ideas, from which infinity of future strategies and innovations arises.
It is not surprising that ideas are overtaken, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become the last 100 years one of the world's largest companies.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (developing both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technological firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking at the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied customer taste and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandons them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programmes and another fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, IBM has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the major economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has been able to overcome the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from the cheese cutter to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that led to the birth of IBM emerges from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "squeeze clock", which allows controlling the entry and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory council.
Flint posted the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, started with the production and sale of all types of business equipment, from meat and cheese cutters to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the great expansion of the company on the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years occupying the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pecese", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consultancy part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and services of high value added.
The strategy that IBM has paid for the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example in terms of transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia from then, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to have the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová received Bartošové at home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
In spite of the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ičany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even fired him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtař broke up with Bartošová, his wife wouldn't wait at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away."
"But here I would live not as my dear old Boric who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties join me," Rychtářová said and added that he had already stripped off her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if a woman has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in place, I make the house arrangements, take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I spoke normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtařová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We didn't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and take all responsibility," Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood to men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half orange who's dependent on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trap in a week?
Do you like to buy often at the discounts?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should relax their passion for shopping, at least a little bit.
But see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk in the clothing stores without more, look for tight clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases sound to you?
Is that so?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It's not that you should stop caring for yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time of their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite thieving.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, wash the floor, remove the dust, wash the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have dirtyly cleaned a new washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be the primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make Unpleasant Comments
"The worn underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet scum is not left on the ground!"
If you do those comets to your partner more times a day, know that you'll get it out of your boxes.
You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Maybe, if men knew this, women, for their part, wouldn't make so many comments.
Calumnia and gossip
Some women also have slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossip women who don't control themselves, who love to gossip and often do it, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially on a female team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The hockey leader Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put the Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assistances were awarded in the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game I told him I'd triple."
"I was presenting him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance was given a goal to Giroux, following the Flyers' first rampage.
A while later the team's second intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček made the album behind the Hurricane harbor and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got the goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he got the third goal, after his shot went down the quarter of Wayne Simmonds' port.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely among the best three," Jágr weighted his central.
"I would never have thought at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, to getting a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up surpassed in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to catch the album and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the party's last goal as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired from an injury at the top of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec couldn't take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but against that you can't do anything, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, pull the disc out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," one of the defenses, P. K. Subban, explained.
Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 in Czechoslovakia there were only five authorized state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime bowed west and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should put on the tail with a sleeping bag and spend like this all night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a currency guarantee, it was not possible to obtain resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs would acquire.
The way in which the Czechs traveled has been undergoing a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that Croatia was not able to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemptions were imposed to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups were sleeping in the parks in tents, as our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was to take food with them (conserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 onwards regularly, to prepare travel using charter flights connections, making travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists leave for far and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit them about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their foreign holidays (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech krona per head on trips abroad, including expenses on the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in a deadlock.
For almost five months the Czech football has been without president and Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will probably not be known either after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the rules of vote to be followed.
Without them, it will not be possible to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
The Czech football presidents are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
Hašek resigned from office in June, not without convening his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute was unleashed between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní děm), located in the Prague neighbourhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
There was no consensus or consensus as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment onwards and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes about the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be thrown out by the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is as follows: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute is about whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three FAČR vice presidents, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravia Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of bicameral system," so Svoboda understands the objections of the morava part, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclik also agrees, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is supposed to be more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives such as in the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who first runs for a candidate and directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be at ease with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be a protagonist again, and this will make it more comfortable to cooperate," says Jablonice's representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement is reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and moravos, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"I hope the common sense will be imposed anyway," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport from the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, as they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sporting organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclik will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate for such a relevant post.
"If there was an appropriate person, I would be struggling for her and I wouldn't present myself as an election candidate."
"But until today a person like this has not been found," said Paclik for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclik to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) presidency.
Paclik also points out that, in the event of defeat, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"I would like to change that vision," he adds.
What Paclik is supposed to be most disturbing at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclik it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case you win, the status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," said Paclik.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta came unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football might bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclik, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning the Thursday elections, Paclik could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same view, the other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Peta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't put my nose there where I don't feel able," said Paclik, who in September attracted much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrary Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik admits he would dare to manage the association.
It relies on its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he has also been the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated in May the triumph in first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclik without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetinský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to make more money available to sport from lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If the taxes on gambling increased, as announced by the political parties, it would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclik now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "not a supporter".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in the fact that I hypocritically surrender my Pilsen Club actions to another person and then come back there after a year and a half," said Paclik.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the stalemate of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of his election, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of being elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to take part in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels take care of football long ago and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"You feel that it is time for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted at the June General Assembly."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Precisely the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He'd been in a long time without attacking Thomas Paclik who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"It's been more than a year in the football world, and it's already made some successes."
"His attacks but were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions to higher competitions.
The latter should be a football promotional showcase.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that emerged from the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately later I would be involved in the negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," he told the 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, a comprehensible nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly succeed.
"Football needs credibility, which will be recovered only if it finally has a leader," yet two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under its leadership, FAČR would start working in an eager way.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, in the event of his election, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemians case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of high-performance youth footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with a lot of impetus."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not resubmitting as a candidate.
"Everybody knows I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me that will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me I must not give up, because then others would give up too."
"It's about having faith not to abandon like this, just like that," he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work that already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work is over that I don't want it to be lost now."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not want someone to stop them," he said, concerned about the fact that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the Hašek era.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be reproached a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the President would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to state the opposite, I have in mind to make the most of it for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravo players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclik, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election struggle, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I'm still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving about tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, television contracts negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, it recognizes its part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain trust in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In case he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that for me," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an amazing, sumptuous Budapest baths: Whoever visits Europe can live his blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest his legs tired in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best wellness in the water is found.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in his luggage, a swimmer.
Swimming back on the water, looking at the artistic dome at the top, swimming towards the marble angels, waiting on the edge of the pool and amazing at the indoor modernist pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "travel for the most extraordinary baths in Centroeuropa" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of the bath culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the bath fans have to conform with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while the running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of the beet forests or listen to the happy trillions of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools must always be so ugly," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting nice swimming pools."
The water surface doubles the architecture.
The brewing in the pool and the etheric sauna oils. The well-being factor in the swimming pools is so great because all the senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the covered swimming pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it is anxious to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the highlights in her research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the waters with nitrates are found in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some hot springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Varosi Termállfürdö in Jászberény).
Many discovered swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city lays eyes on the roofed swimming pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow deck, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary awaits customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral of Ötztal water looks like an ovni that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources it rises steam in winter, while from the background the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Arpad baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gasoline plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sunbaths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he found a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the broken windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
The decadence was countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can neo-omanic elements be discovered of the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arabic hall of style Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its eminent modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favourite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace like this, diving in the thermal pool apparently is not very important.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, that 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of an orderly survey by the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global raw material stock markets raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the world hunger problem.
The consumer defender's campaign specifically addresses Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have been decoupled from offers and demands, and earn from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good fame of the Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann's trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Rising food-priced bets show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks currently damage public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank lobby, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at risk for food price betting," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of people who are starving or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation it can perfect its image.
And he needs you to scarcely care about any loss, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offer investments on which food prices would be bet.
Many bank clients showed personal consequences by discovering that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would advise a bank like this to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflecting, cancelling their account and switching to another institute.
The 21st House in Vienna
The transferred pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition of Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra passionate, the clear forms, the glass halls, the brave curves and the new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is thus far considered a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, rose after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was opened inside, called the "20th House".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, or a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and declines increasingly.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was opened, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the belvedere Austrian gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of the politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building will be built.
strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he sensiblely reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the contest, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He was aware of the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "a devourer of energy," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass was installed reinforced with glass fiber and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient caoba tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly what it was before.
And all this with strict control on the part of the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Brussels came from" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "sluggish appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted "to wake up the right conscience".
In this case, the 21th house is not in the wrong place, there has been a coup of urban luck. The completely new and planned "town of the central station", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky blow will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction of Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the crashes of the trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the damages and delays of the winter-caused trains, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the investments planned until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this to be achieved, better availability of vehicles and of the rail network is still extremely long.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and the platforms.
The aim is to clean snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, warned about crashes and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he was lacking reservations to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of a shaft at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States.
After the tumult about President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCAA financial market regulator blames many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit cooperatives and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investment.
NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other large banks and in the summer brought litigation against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or to punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without specifying an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests vigorously in the IBM Information Technologies company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies as long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
It must have understood long before that IBM offers mainly services and seeks computer systems for the information technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently revealed on the NCBC economy issue that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus increased to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership that took care of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of lucrative Information Technologies such as the operation of calculating centres.
The old over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided technology companies so far.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of winning money has provided him with the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stocks in stock rose by one percent.
"The blue giant," as IBM is known, has a stock exchange value of more than $220 billion and is among the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The Threat Is Concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", the Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloodous ideology" that resurrects.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, this news has been reacted with fear and concern.
For many Turkish-born Germans, a ghost that was believed to have been dead long ago, from the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no further episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The uncovered ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Revives the bloody ideology?", titles the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper "Sabah" highlights that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence took place with joyful colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media like a slap: "The German Gift for the Fifty Anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
It is emphasized that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Turkish Germans, police behaviour and subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long before sought suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some show themselves the least rhetoric about the drastic media: "From now it is lost, immigrants have nothing but self-defence and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the suitability of the sanction to the entire network.", writes "Selen".
Which means that if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire-shaped attack by Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his or her taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows once again how profound it has been since been the mistrust of many Turkish-born Germans in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a review of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich Lake scandal
Europe's most risky bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's led by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets drop nice remarks about his future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB administrative council has been considered equally touched since then, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economy and counselor and has had a period of adaptation probably necessary.
He is suddenly responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved that he deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, saves the old proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis started.
The USB had an excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset administrator, but also daunting, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressing.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later bank teacher in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general director, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to depreciate billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some looked with contempt until sooner: an Asian and opaque state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best-paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank purchased problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic results (see graph).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who might have defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the discreet aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the president of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of the client's funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banks through erroneous speculations and in asset management through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was going to be a little quieter again, just when the UBS was thought to get it back, this wretched story of the operator happens, an individual operator failed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the Adoboli case it is stated that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution emerged, with which the Swiss bankers had been present for a long time, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the alpine republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich doesn't fit in with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters on Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry stores like Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli confectionery.
The Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, passing through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank says.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all the Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too large, he thinks, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have won land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons for a long time."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost both money in the jungle of high risk and the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises which, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different pioneer banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the centre of the property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says Hans Geiger banking expert.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The despair arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of managers, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Getting Goldman Sachs out of the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange transactions and stock negotiation, it was at the highest.
However, business advisers highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has vacuums in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
In terms of growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to titularize American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own account.
And also, like other banks, he sought the decline for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought it," said Geiger, bank expert.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts at the UBS have become projectible seats and are insecure so far.
Today, who runs a big bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (always).
But investment banks must be reduced a lot, it is clear at the moment.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct the UBS's business, said Zurich's bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to his state in the mid-1990s.
Eliminate 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far, he's only saying that he'll first find a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
Changes in government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
Brake industrial production on the continent suffocates the hopes of stabilizing in its origin a crisis caused by debt.
General relief could not be imposed on changes in government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems go back to a foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed with a decrease of 0.6 percent to 12.078 points.
At the session, the market barometer ranges from 12.027 to 12.170 points.
The S&P 500 rate closed with 1,251 points, a drop of one percent.
The Nasdaq index of the technology stock lost 0.8 percent and left the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is fired with a drop of 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is placed at the end of its boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
What created scepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investment, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to put an end to the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
That is why from its point of view it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the US technological sector.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supports the quote of the traditional consortium's shares and makes it cotizate against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged to $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid 170 dollars on average for each unit and maintained 5.5 percent.
Berkshire Hathaway's shareholdings lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of American's share securities were clearly strengthened with 2.6 percent of the market.
The house sells almost the rest of its shares to the China Construction Bank and is therefore embedded in $6.6 billion.
The institute mainly wants to strengthen its share of capital with the net profit of the business and thus meet the regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft builder increased her profits and thus limited the losses in Dow.
The action was raised by 1.5 percent, after the consortium was charged with the greatest commission in its history.
Airline Emirates commissioned 50 long-distance aircraft of type 777 on Friday and the order value was ciphered at 18 billion dollars.
Including the options for 20 more machines, the volume is $26 billion.

719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq hills with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 upward shares, 1,913 downwards and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent Grajos extend in the cities
In many places grajos are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, the experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the neighbors' complaints for the crap and noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means have appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The grajos no longer leave the cities, says the experts at the first symposium on grajos in Read, East Frisia.
There specialists throughout the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grains; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly ending with traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The greas are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Read.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district's gravel was leaped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have described animal hunting by traps for birds and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"By expelling them and driving them away normally, nothing is achieved," Werner Klöver, the urbanist and Landscaper of Read said.
Shooting with water to the nests or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Leaving them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, elderly residences or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Read.
A combination of frightening animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist makes advertising against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak on the face with aplomo."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's greas, where signs report the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grajos not only take advantage of the resources to access squid bites, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grays to where bird intelligence arrives.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a larvae of pollina.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, gray sculptures had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a pollilla larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get to their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four grajos got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the 2012 European Cup thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 European Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed on the play-offs the latest tickets for the 2012 European Cup in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant Christian hero Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the one-way party, made the five following Eurocopa participations.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the back game of the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro, after the one party (2-0) left things clear.
Croatia did not let him be marked in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland won a 1-1 (1-0) strike against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) marked the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalti (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) cut distances twice to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African world playoffs.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter hour later, Nani showed his talents to mark from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not look in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the goalman Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the leader of the English Manchester City, sent a head to the stick, but the ball did not cross the portrait line (33.).
Jiracek was successful for the Czech Republic
Then, the college Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of penitenti bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark called for a controversial penalti after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After rest, the 2004 European Vice Champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt on the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the European Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, Porter Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the door of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the Stevan Jovetic duo and Leaven Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked on the 40th minute of the frontal turn, very right at the Cech port.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the world-famous doorman's larguero, the front of the FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the party.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat from third-party bankruptcy in the world of 2002, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the final of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 viewers at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In minute seven and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan was only able to play the pole. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball into the port.
Following the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let any goals hit him.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took place Ivan Perisic, of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated the first participation in the European Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, set his head in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied up with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
From the very beginning, the Estonian defence avoided possible goals of advantage.
But on the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense of the doorman Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and smashed the ball across the line, getting the 1-0.

Personal massacre
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, "begins with a long person drama of the kind that can cause one to fall soul to his feet.
Here are some performance tips: Simply start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will come to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and unemployed in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"The beauty and pain of the battle "combines the experiences in wartime of more or less 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from college and botanical to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or they will lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives blink here as vocal candles lit in a church; new ones add to the mix while others turn off.
Mr Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the filthy war of trenches on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intratable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that sucks at heart.
When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you stay or flee?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Deficiency of facts," says Mr Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of the memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or touching, but they are more life-filled in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, by Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Successful, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bands, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in ram fat (and sliced with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wood soles".
There are, he notes, "837 authorised meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impetus towards savageness and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit in chairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and stubborn pecker."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care about him.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, he's horribly like "a convicted man being strangled in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," says Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century's bestiary: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer with clothing of good clothing that performs his butcherry while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcus pus, which soldiers buy and embolden with it their genitals in the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it upon their eyes, which often leads to a blindness of life."
In this Swedish translation made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, the war on "exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No News on the front of Erich María Remarque, instead of comprehensive stories.
Mr Englund's volume is linked to an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like I've come from his book, ripped off that dramatic page persone from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a false step before, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing disturbance helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation remained secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spraying of pepper spray over the protesters, violating the department's rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And that's why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti protester park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called training of disorders - counter-terrorist measures involving rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they stopped when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the city district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel to work daily, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there was the least number of people in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with focus and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-written messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was played until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been abruptly treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense maragna of personal effects of protesters, including luggage and bags of paper trash and plastic packed with clothing, the teams of the Department of Cleanliness followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the park center.
Some of them made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicentre were slapped among themselves by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "change of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "he wasn't running the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to get in.
They climbed barricades on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At a given time, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At a given time, a plywood piece flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The support workers union will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that care for poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, in municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their work on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health-care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
In an audience at the City Council last month, the education counselor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council counter-attacked him saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the complaint at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as accused, with eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been undersupported chronically.
It is noted that although there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in Southern Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, demand says, "This is not a wealthy parent neighborhood that can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The Memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" most often describes the act of transferring a school payroll teacher to a job bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not only in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed and the US participation came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "greatness".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House about the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of US military in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not so angry as to actually dry the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress was then overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulations to the Libyan people for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "election to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as the June Bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
The Spokesman of Place said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the Chamber or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced to this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially rookie Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote for an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can carry out, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal as well as an amendment prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that Members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Gifted but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him on fire at a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway's "The Sun will come tomorrow" melody and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to go back to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and perforated the left side of his brain, and which passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Enough well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special one-hour "20/20" program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of courage and hope".
The special program analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband animates her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while the therapists teach you how to do simple actions.
A head move.
A frowned lip.
And then, his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "stamped", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congressman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who had two hours of therapy every day, said he didn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper on the murder of 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"During, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back harder than ever."
The troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered to be heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as a kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been seized by the military and an American audience often distant, sometimes adoring.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if those who are uniformed were apprehensive.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops that returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks are conducted in silence and private among war veterans.
After his two children returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "angered and violent veteran underneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding work from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference towards wars.
Achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," said retired lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who wore a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, the native Texas left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within a few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and violating her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are looking forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their comrades, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's biggest plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? High command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries in the armed forces.
For a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active personnel.
"The alleged damage is part of the complainants' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, besides hers.
At the Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynical environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is forming a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the manner in which he handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Attack and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are significantly underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the indices of prosecution: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were tried - half as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor—of a cut in her arm—was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember I told my command officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made him unfit for service.
In January 2010 it was delivered from the service in less-than-honorable terms, which prevents you from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his colleagues in lawsuit continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of Doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not on its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this subject until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aerated his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a massacre in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report on European digital populism by the DEMOS British study center.
Facebook's personal information range is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe and then directed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon reaching through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not quite surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who talked about their drunken feats on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Children's Health, Behaviour and Development Centre at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" its own population to obtain data.
The site's Data Team has developed statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information that you can access - defenders of digital freedom long ago who argue that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with the Facebook public walls of students.
"As for them, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that an investigation theme is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper holder and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social is still happening offline."
"Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said to a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, since it received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 victims' survivors and relatives attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked in.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said one Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a victim's family member.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in a Theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared him with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered that has been unbuttoned as an advance of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been only 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he already worked intensively in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full copy was discovered in VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archive material is the base of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes out to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster towards the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computers.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"During the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks of things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to detail his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerned by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made with a good bucket eye, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs to detail.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and you were screaming through the public phone and came back a minute later to the public phone next door," says Jobs with a little laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two of them burst into a shell just before the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the telephone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
On several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the way.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, a client asked him if he could mount the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while on Apple, he remembers the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Said you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopies and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company has no more success.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and those responsible for the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't make electrons do, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjusting them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been embarrassed about stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computers, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the health care law rivals while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were robbed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will report the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study thoroughly the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historical allegation is expected by March, and the result will probably further disrupt the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full apogeo at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law should be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary court hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Care Act.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that goes into conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge can attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the agenda of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges who comply with the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were haunted in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they too easily mix the court's activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law so far as to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record order of 18 billion dollars
Emirates airline asks for 50 double-aircraft Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than a billion dollars.
Rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of your product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the selling price for the 50 aircraft is a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 jets double corridor.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aeronautical Hall.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presupposes a fuel saving and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora's analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep track of his competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade his dominance with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in useful load and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contender for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Michoacán governor during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped lean the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state governor's career to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calderon, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, remained in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A mayor of the PAN was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning by Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help to boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "imparcial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European Monetary Union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's indebtedness costs have been dangerously triggered and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to join in helping the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won't fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-generating companies such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "low risk" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and cause a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it is afraid of an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican by South Carolina.
He said that Congress' failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "abduction", would result in 23 percent of global reductions and a stop to many new projects.
"A large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other efforts of modernization," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously harm goodwill."
The cuts in time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While financing for wartimes in the accounts of Overseas Contingency Operations is not directly affected by kidnapping, the efforts of war would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the war-supporting contract."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and certainly it is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"Abduction is a threat to the interests of U.S. national security, and it must not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent senator warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, even though he arrived at a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a shady picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morality, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential opponents."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta mentions new details of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and committed previously throughout the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping F35's development and additional evidence could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent are deception and lies in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party charges lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports saying that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolás Sarkozy, was "picked" with an open microphone stating to the US President, Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Liar has destroyed races and convulsionate countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of his refutes quickly contested by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations in financing the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived him will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the responses of the exams to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deceit do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Identifying lies, or "locating lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades in prestigious universities that carried out research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lies have been contested.
The liars do look in the eyes.
They don't always tartamude, balbuce, rubore, or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfaced expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years studying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know by the investigations that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more "faith-oriented lies to themselves," while women lie more "focused on others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their couples than people who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "great").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual conduct.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Watch the subject's position, laughter and vocal feature.
You better know if someone usually hits his foot all the time so he doesn't make unfair accusations when he sees his feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean towards an exit, change their position significantly or exhibit a "post-interviewed shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have ended.
Often interrogators make falsely see that the interview has ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distance language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the oil pipeline deviated from the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the trade unions, while pacifing the ecologists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned oil pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State may separate any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the Department of State's request, and expressed their full support.
The 1700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
I'd take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed the plan are weighing legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, frightening her little daughter to the point she threw up in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" scared Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stageist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he stood near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came over the back and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said "yes and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
"LaBelle staggered over the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and withdrawn to a car waiting for her," Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money that he can get to a child support association with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it goes to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old in arms."
Climate Adversity Stopped the Economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated for change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3,6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31,16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of impacts on the frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops were vegetables, maize and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed as from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people throws more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity on the market because of the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation adopted at the congress to combat money laundering, since for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to get in, and secondly because entering they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population in the state works without being quoted as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour loss is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the greatest decrease in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years, according to the State FDI's Ministry of Economy from January to June amounted to $630,000, 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5 million, 143 thousand, 312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to regain the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economicitude
Loredo Lopez stated that events like the freezings of early year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing far below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the state's vocation and economic direction, because it is important that Sinaloa devote all the potential of the material and human resource it has," he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, in the area of economic development there are some progress but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana.
Five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine were sentenced to a neighbour of Navolato for possession of eight kilos of mariguana.
The Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the offence against health, in his variant of possession of mariguana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th post, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-conductor was circulating in a pick up-type truck, white, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle's box and in the co-driver's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be inmate at the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
It must contribute to works
Social works covered by programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while work programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the Government of the State has not complied with its corresponding contributions, which amount to a resource greater than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that investment in these three programmes totals nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, and that the possible delay in the completion of these programmes becomes in force.
"It's almost 12 million that's what it's up to them to contribute, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't even given us a fifth, when they had to give us a part since July," he said, "we so as not to delay we've started the works and they're going very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million which the State administration did not provide on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six-year because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we in order to be able to access these programs had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that's what it's up to them to contribute and even though the year's about to end they haven't even given us a fifth."
Court validated "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogic blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reservation of law.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all actions in it arranged for digital transition.
The Ministers' Plenary also decided to dismiss the appeal filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his statement, the president minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure the measures to prepare the public administration through general rules.
"I do not think that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, who has constitutional mandate, the State's rectory.
Replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, leading to better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Deferring change, he said, would be to defer the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of State economic rectification, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, is being assured.
Analysing the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not recorded.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminar Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records are not accounted for.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, provided that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the finalization of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the State Official Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state president to constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" as it does not have the right to "punish or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In such a way, the partial number of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no scrutiny and computation record in the box file or does not work with the President; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the ballot boxes may be made where there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition who put forward the second of the candidates mentioned.
The total number of votes may also be made if, at the end of the regular count, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the secondly located candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate has been secondly, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is Morelia's choice, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Three abandoned bodies are located in Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed with bullets in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from the Cadereyta road to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose barde is beige color with coffee, the open gate was found from pair to pair.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, and immediately gave notice to the authorities concerned.
One of the individuals wore yellow sleeves with dark mingle trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with white sleeves.
Just a metre was the body of another individual with a red shovel and blue mingled trousers.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.
In the barde of the fifth there are legends that are directed by one group of organized crime to another, as well as several bullet holes in it and the gate.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country at the edge of the economic disaster
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the result of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well-delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the beating confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Rescueing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections go ahead.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of their retaliation to a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreement between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The spray of the Spanish is superior to that of the puppets
Of the 22 soccer players called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side only one of the 22 convened arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if they compare the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranch, account for a wide record of class A interselections, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This number was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
In addition to the above, the experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football is added.
On the contrary, Tick footballers have a limited international rot in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is from Archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play before the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a brain wheel of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA together with the other hundreds of the Iberian team, the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariete, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five overcame the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Less.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not approaching at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures them that it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose full transcript is on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican followers, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what his fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica just once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask him because there is some kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely in the previous days.
What do you tell your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're very anxious to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great surfing places; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take a while not to play, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it makes it more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We're very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends of all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like you stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've been growing, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too much of a tour because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without getting incapable of being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we're still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
They're so many.
Inside the first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little off-line from the word grunge.
When I think about her, she reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's worth listening to music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re boarding for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the language by which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its inferior members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because it is known innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been combined, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been incarcerated in the National Directorate for Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people by an army extermination squad operating clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official comitia, led by Uruguayan president José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico this Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propriate for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations," according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that emerged when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigote plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions so far: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS laptop console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without having to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for that support" , since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simply" to hook up less skilled users.
Once exceeded, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present the greatest difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, which was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guineas to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, namely that the plumber of the mustache will have to tour mined platforms of danger with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new developments in movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he formalized the extradition of former ruler Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the $70 million laundering conspiracy.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that was claiming Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of judicial and executive powers, bearing in mind that a court of judgement had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he "didn't put his hands in court decisions" and dealt with all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action involves an executive proceeding after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandatory between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once its legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the Q120 million defalque in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reacted to the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
To that end, the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group are added.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low training, without work, with problems of dogradiction or in a position to fall into marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former conseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large room of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the present is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Unsatisfied an okupad farm where they made macho parties
The invaders had taken over from 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the 51st of the street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday's noon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro parties that despaired from the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowd festivals, which lasted until two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, since they sold the cups to three euros, while at the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure premises had had to respond to neighbouring complaints for noise, while, according to she pointed out, discomfort was not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the Okupada house and, above all, by the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The nightclub manager explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that she "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property to put an end to the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this sense he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be forceful against the incivilism that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mosses evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed to 35 on Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the heart of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Collserola promotion pasquines.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park relocated, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain)-under (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the Jabalis in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the City Council convened a megacompetition consisting of 16 competitions for so many other gates of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the park idea, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the theme of conversation among all Barcelonan architects.
It is almost a recurring issue to take care of when two members of this former caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives foot, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonan architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It may start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Ports of Collserola" encloses a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think about them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intelligent challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangerous derives from the "uncertain that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and had in the area of the Forum "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already setting the next step," that is, its overpass.
"You have to think of new urban instruments, planning, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can give rise to real disasters."
More closely linked to the question, Mòdol believes that, by simplifying, the Vallesan side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a mere topographic issue.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "is not to fall into broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to his union to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the closeness of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a right," he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the foundations of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-cutting contests have been convened," she says, "in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This leads, at least where appropriate, to the choice to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can crash in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his view, that is the case, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately higher than the Dalt Round should provide, throughout its scope, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal overseer of the Casino Network granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal overseer of the Casino Network granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmailing process against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that the Regiomontano City Council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Procurator's Office opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the Panist Mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and held in custody for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
In that place, he remained for 49 days after he was given a second order of instigation after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the crimes of coercion and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months after inquiries, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
This Monday, Casino Red's legal overseer, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to court by José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regio mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During legal proceedings, the public prosecutor adscribed to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the gambling house was the one who granted forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, the legal pardon is granted to Jonah Larrazábal and thereafter no claim may be filed concerning the process followed by him; in addition to the fact that he will not be required for reparation of damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal seller of the gambling house, around 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Juzgado, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He shall also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where he lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven others, indicated that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it was a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation could last several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at a cruise speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed suitable conditions for take-off as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloud at low height.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew has sought a lesser area of elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The aircraft's remnant dispersion pattern makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the sinister, evidence remains undisclosed in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disintegrated along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Directs Social Security research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents', which will allow for overweight markers.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionologists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and graduates from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Research and Advanced Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population to participate whether or not they are entitled to participate, to visit the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Poniente Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity was carried out in the Sports Unit Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is achieved, the study will continue in the Sports Unit (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (North of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day was held on 14 November, it stated that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of the hereditary family of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It detailed that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetics are applied to all participants (genes associated with child obesity are identified).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight in minors.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 pointed out that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', stressed the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of their genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate in the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (heats) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, doctors give it in writing to parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt would Avoid Bachelors
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were served, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baches each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of a pavement is the right one, the baches could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
At its conference A technological opinion of the bachelors, issued in the framework of the International Year of Chemicals, announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of baches.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weights, called asphalts, and other low molecular weights, called Maltese, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, he added.
This means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ investigator noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the proper thickness and care must be taken of the material that is made of.
Climate, especially moisture and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore the formation of baches.
In the process of forming a bachelor, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only after it affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of baches and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid the formation of baches frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow for the repair of baches easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 as Princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being in the podium of winners, showing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose up with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of valley women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princess among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in every presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
To the interrrogant the valleycaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is "The Beginner", it's a pretty deep book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that I didn't like first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted has marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina manifested feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Beginner" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned down by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovationate and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the vote of the public for the best handicraft costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in his first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of Hilton and his two parades on the crowning evening.
Although she looked safe in both, it was noted that she was lacking the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the RCN Canal program, said that the fact that Melina was nominated princess "sees that the candidate who won the most prizes during the competition is not left as a queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was mistaken.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the demolition and fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
The preparationr of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorious, lowered it points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the valleycaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his strength and here he was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time delivers the National Contest of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit a cruel watting emerged that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the little contentment Raymundo gave Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina starts from today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the queens that despite her kneeling passage through Cartagena, she was avoided by the crown.
This was the work of the warmth that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali lophoscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a Cali CTI lophoscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the match of his digital prints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI seccional, that week was the turn of "availability" for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to enter the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after carrying out the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against the alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who directed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decactilar card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
I was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galtonian glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the print
For a printer from the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can become key to crime resolution.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When captured, many criminals present false papers or have no papers.
We took their fingerprint and searched them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print in the bottle coincided.
Even though this doesn't guarantee that he was the killer, he places him at the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that in objects "the prints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a print.
However, if it can be used, if the respective match is made.
The "indigenous" defy authorities in New York City
Hundreds of protesters were hitting the Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupation Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Grand Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were hitting the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indigenous" to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further to the north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to recamp in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and we're going to continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indigenous" to the eviction of their camp personally issued by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indigenous" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which joins New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and who have tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of that court order at this time and even handing them over to the officers who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes," Bray said, who reported that some officers were hitting the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit protesters from re-accessing the park with stores or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, who were warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to relocate with tents and sleeping bags.
The ruler personally defended the eviction carried out early in the morning of the Zuccotti Square, an operation in which approximately 200 arrests were carried out and that was decided because the protesters were "violing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", since "some businesses have received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "lack of respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupa Wall Street" leaders also indicated that they intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a helper in "Baywatch", a "Playboy" rabbit, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special of Canadian television.
CTV's private TV channel today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a homemade pornographic video in which he appears along with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
At the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that started in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the gross domestic product data between July and September served to pass the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rebound of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolt of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable scaled 1%, pushed by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "collateral values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen quotation.
While the markets continue with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower the guard.
"We need to be careful of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries presented sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are being slowed down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to the 100.8 of August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when eight tenths to 99.13 points were precipitated.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues to be involved in the maze leading to the emergence of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period agreed on in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said in opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear the doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8 billion million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give a good look to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is also no final date.
The Greek makeup still has a thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-wide preponderant place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor in the last two decades in relation to this intrusion of cooperation, whose "essence" is that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations on the horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in that which aims to reduce half the volume of people living with less than a daily dollar, with the "hull of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", principal beneficiaries of these loans.
"Many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is intended that by the end of 2015 the 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that 100 million of these households will leave the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The impetus in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, remarked Doña Sofía as a "debted act of justice and recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as a "famous idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "I have all been able to see the continuing evolution," said His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the classification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded from all who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has been without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Initially, Europe's future had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The proposal for a European Commission Presidency was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded against and 10 abstentions.
The standing onion of several minutes that was won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be expressed in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control of the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any event, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that the 27 will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weight each country's weight of the European Central Bank directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm down the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not told France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sickness casualties
After the grants, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and to make a speech on the topic, which has been recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls a axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sickness casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government intends to impose a fourth day's shortage on private sector workers before being able to take off.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of wage, or at least 15 per cent of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unpaid deficiency in case of low work (to date, they have no deficiency, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuse of low work.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned, speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of low employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue and a number of offensive policies have been launched which have, normally, been fruitful.
The French are sick only in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, firstly, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006 for low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, the low-income subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46 per cent correspond to maternity and occupational accident casualties, while 54 per cent relate to sickness casualties, amounting to €6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French had taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day's sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sickness losses were less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) varied between 10 and 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of 285,000, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure which, starting at a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who received sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to the UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9,000 million and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of discount subsidies and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to correct its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared before Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he added that the 100 days granted to his union government would not be sufficient to achieve that objective.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has anticipated that the country's public deficit will be reduced "up to about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
A Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the Canadian Royal Society's report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to that end.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Canadian Society, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethical, legal and medical.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient proposes such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Canadian Royal Society.
And, even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the Federal Government's position, which had already stated that they did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not constituted a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non-competent persons or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconferencing that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favorable to euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia does not mean that the lives of older or disabled persons are less valuable.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that a process against them should not be initiated.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations it is suggested that the Criminal Code indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for the training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be regarded as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations with regard to the findings of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Descamps, a specialist in Health Law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, inter alia because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the patients in the terminal phase.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," Deschamps says, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" with regard to the findings of the report, which she described as a "manifesto in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, questioned especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
The Bachar El Asad partisans spoke yesterday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad's Syria was intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces the existence of a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh position.
On the other hand, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the strengthening of the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesperson of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombing and shooting with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the city besieged by Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, believes that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his opinion, falls within the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to bring the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov has yesterday judged the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time from the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and launch a program that will include "sacrifice" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and the employer.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after having met with the President of the designated Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the obligors yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he stressed, adding that it is "safe that the markets will have patience and will understand it".
Its appointment by the President initially received market satisfaction, but then concern was imposed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he holds office, he will work in the light of the urgency and the aim of Italy 'recovering its role' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for new rigorous measures.
The Italian "Chief of the Heads" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him by the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", as the editorialists say.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200,000 million euros in State obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
Last week, the AIEA expressed its "great concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on AIEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focusing on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
It is then believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA mentions that "there are clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who was not only well aware of the technique, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of its career in this technology in the military programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent global increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent are due to racial differences and 20 per cent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and must strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "crimes of hatred".
The "crime of hatred" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to follow the activity of other "Twittos" more readily and lively, i.e. those internet users whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or they follow you.
This allows to know whether they track messages, whether they are paid to new accounts, whether they call any messages favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to the AFP Twitter spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus large avec a maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation at the heart of "tweets" with different opinions.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better track some elements of my Twitter flow," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/democratic-Christian coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (thirty A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austria's public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay another €3 billion in interest each year," said Christian Democrat Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October last: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "regulation".
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, whereas regional States, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention from the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen per dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been climbing down gradually since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar requoted on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted to about 120 yen and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income earned abroad by Japanese companies when converting them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north), Noda stressed, fearing that the enrichment of the root yen is the weak recovery.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the broadcasting institute increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury Letters, leading to 55 trillion yens (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags fall
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis remains detrimental to European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges will sink a little further in the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3.064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Bearing in mind the new tensions with regard to the returns on loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed more than 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian 10-year obligations reached 6.85%, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being suffocated with the weight of their debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market sight, while there will be legislative elections on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Expecting euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than expected 0.3 per cent, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts should be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will need to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to their park, renewing the construction of a power station interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is against such a speech.
Berlin's choice will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
It must be meditated on the case of Denmark.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, of which 30 per cent of its electricity, is also one of the major coal and gas users due to wind intermittent; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a bill of electricity 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would lead to a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would give rise to the marvelous declarations about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not express opposition in principle to that type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and which can create non-localizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to operate for sixty years, when its manufacturer's collapse is scheduled?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, nor is there a diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of security.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR has a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all electrical actors who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotion, dogmas and partisana manoeuvres to dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped on the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will help solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restriction of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the unskilled, by pressuring for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly practised in sectors without employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1 per cent of migration flows represents a long-term increase in real wages from 0.6 to 0.9 per cent.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (import less expenditure) of €150,000 to average public budgets throughout his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Such teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Coroneles in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to succeed definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One," that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient on its own and can even become a "instrument of oppression", as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis that we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its inability, its inconsistency.
It must be reflected on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer making good progress.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we don't want to get hits of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that applies to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from their powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The emergence of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except in order to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, it would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Interested Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic point of view.
It is only possible to build a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europe.
Cards with chip "without contact" are generalized
The worldwide chip card lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11 per cent in world sales of microprocessors cards (bank cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations of the Eurosmart Cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of the technology without contact, which allows you to pay for transport in common or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million cards with no contact chip will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 ( 580 million units are projected) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind with regard to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the uncontacted payment sector.
About 26 million Visa Bank Cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its starts are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to move the top, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminating in the future, among their customers, unconnected banking cards," says Gérard Nébouy, General Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for the transaction.
"They're lagging behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows uncontacted payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société geneérale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact via their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already "has certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing any further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Raptured in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The survey of calls made indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and similar kamikazes or explosive devices than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems created by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of illuminated persons of unworthy interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "West education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the northern Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are thrown into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter focus first on the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 were recorded dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram re-attacked Abuya, particularly against the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of them.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, covering from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, disturbs all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidentials, the voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more loud statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong spot for Republicans.
The mottos, often unfounded, extend over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race towards the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key issue in a America exacerbated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Ambassador in China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "brushs" emotions.
He has called for a strong, but constructive dialogue with Beijing ( Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stays stagnated in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I go out elected, I will stop Iran," he fanfarroned.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing with his obligations in relation to that partner.
Employer Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows a disgraceful knowledge of such subjects.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The resort to torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of Iraq's "boys" and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population rather positively judged Obama's national security balance sheet, which ended Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that lead to a collapse.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the banks of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have jointly turned the valve wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, a further 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km communicating the San Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 which will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents victorious atmospheres.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land flows by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
By the way, these two countries lose some power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the top of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet covenant", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large contracts in the gas sector are as political as well as economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom's managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this pipeline also represents a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, for caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream society.
Measures for the protection of fauna and flora were also necessary.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project managers gave up on it when they saw that the Swedish were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea off their coasts.
"In case of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller says.
In case of leakage, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that there will be a leak, since they have planned clusters that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is introduced into the inner tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full journey days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
To her, the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and exploitation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to that company, for a period of twenty-five renewable years, the total capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported," Jens Müller says.
The financing of gas pipeline construction has been completed by 30% with shareholders' contributions and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the project should reach €7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenditure.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy shore planted with pine trees.
Valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas at arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return to people the taste of writing.
It has an air of adventure, from hours of writing to the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as ageed by time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian fashion company, based on Milan, decided at that time to launch a booklet of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for launching the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (topo skin), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover the banquets.
This type of booklet was highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And it succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, as the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.
The Italian small company, which had twelve workers in its inception, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstore, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has released the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubled the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
discouraging?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress achieved for 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
It should be mentioned that unemployed persons with disabilities continue to face many obstacles to accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with an average of 38 per cent.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the quid of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality progresses, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité said that the respondents have "a level of knowledge about disabilities", with a "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually deficient".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a target set by a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies owning between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of enterprises with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
On the verge of facing the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivence among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his leader's resentment against Turkey's gesture, the Belgian selector has only praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front responds.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "is a set", has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year long, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill".
Don't forget the placer.
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will certainly strengthen especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathhieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"We just faced it recently.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made a reference to the "organ."
"Surrection" for controversy "a gala game."
"Surrency" also for verifying, as a "neighbour" that France "comes to be a very high-level team," about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"They'll be able to see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal faces with great optimism the return party against Bosnia (22h00), to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party, both teams were lacking realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs since September 2010, is going to qualify for the 2012 European Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the party (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given it the tranquility.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house."
But at home, in the luminous Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass before a public who should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal, " dixit an optimistic but lucid Bent.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chances of participating in the 2012 EuroCup," Carlos Queiroz's successor has, however, relativized.
The tie of Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention, from the beginning, to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "do not leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
