Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American President of history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, the visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him from 172 people to 33 organizations.
Then, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth American president to receive it, even the third one to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will come.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litomřice police accused the president of the Společnost ochráncě přirody Litomřice civic association of blackmail (Society of Litomřice natural defenders).
Last year he appealed several times against some procedures for granting construction licences and to withdraw the appeals he demanded from investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesperson of the Litomřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Litomęřice Nature Defensor Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packings and in the villages of southern Moravia you can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate garbage at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the town councils are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely behind in the separation of garbage, not only because of the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET into the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in the Plaza Moravské namęsti, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
For vagueness
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to dump several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which embarrasss us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The "Paroubek" budget removed money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or for building savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently request a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That only means deferring problems for the future, it is laying mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay more and more interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state doesn't have much choice to get money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating expenses of the State, it has to increase taxes.
To all that the left now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, your children too.
People don't have to worry about incomes or sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will continue to increase alongside interest costs.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of motorways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors where the invitation to tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The best thing you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or cessating the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a bag without background.
Last year, ČEZ allocated 18 billion million to the budget.
Each year of dividends are liquidated ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation costs, including in building savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Then, the minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, take care of the government's budget reserve.
The Státní pokladna project (State Fund), which is a price of two billion and which has already been launched, is also 100 million short. It must allow to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come," Janota warns.
Your future smartphone can work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user will be able, by pressing a key, to change between various operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtualizer software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the teleski keepers in Krkonoše are worried about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow causes people not to book ski stays in hotels and bed and breakfasts.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if we are called, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," said the keeper of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerěv Mlýn depending on their expectations, should not hesitate to book your stay any more.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindleręv Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we're most interested in is Christmas Week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," Ingtours director Petr Schiefert mentioned.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer Christmas Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are also sold very well on the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there'll be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks stay snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snęžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the stays in Nochevieja are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Láznę.
On the contrary, half of the beds are still free at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně on Christmas.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about 60 percent of the occupying capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest for stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that Krkonoše's hoteliers will be overwhelmed waiting for snow.
The temperatures must fall on Thursday and, if there are rains, the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected with anxieties, it was demonstrated that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use several times the "equal as in Iraq", but he also did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "A new path forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war. And that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
In the next few months, however, they demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is spoken of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen to harsh criticism in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated on the general over 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, starting to withdraw Afghan troops in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratriced wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss each day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After it will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who doesn't know anything about reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of U.S. defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their electors, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to resolve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution in this way will mean a dramatic setback to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that it is three years away for the presidential elections and that is why there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to go, he mentioned the former investor banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after having cut off nearly $17 billion (almost 3 billion CZK) for bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20,000 million.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Great Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax once, with a tax of fifty percent, the bonuses for banks that exceed the £25,000 (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Awards in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, today in Stockholm received this year's Nobel Awards from King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he also ranked among the award-winners a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry was received by the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a rewarded woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award-winner collected the diploma, Nobel's medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish krone (approximately 25 million Czech krone).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel of Peace received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the subjects of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
The meeting was discussed by President Radim Ochvat's spokesperson.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted on Wednesday the left proposals for transfers of funds and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the social democrats' proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious internal policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Party of Greens, begin to be controversial.
The critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long been neglecting "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong judgments".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is scary, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the $200 billion.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some criticisms say that the leading roles play American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the American actor who won an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I will have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama on the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African stateist spent 27 years in prison for his activities to put an end to apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who united his forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to join his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to the world-wide extent to the outsiders.
The South African team succeeded in reaching the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much like reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be amongst frames before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by squeezing your hand, I receive your energy, this is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rugby hard world.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened up and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much higher in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendour about Norway resolved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia ended up recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway made evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Not even their repeated presence in missile testing has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure in the air occurred.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During the thirteenth trial, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a ship that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified steering object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the outset did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that we cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile lasted and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were damaged immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches passed completely without error, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at 51 years of age
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at 51 years of age to a professional hockey meeting.
The former champion of the world, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help their CSKA team Moscow and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of 40 in 1998 and is currently chairing the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary front Gordie Howe played at the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The top of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Room.
Hyundai met the requirements of the trade unions. Cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the trade unions declared the strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanęk, the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The leadership, however, wants for this year to agree with the trade unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, i.e., it will work in two shifts, Vanjk said.
According to Server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vajka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or take a day off on December 28, i.e. prolonging Christmas parties in one day, Vanjk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vanęk mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory's management and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike due to frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The trade unionists, in their declaration of the strike emergency on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, which last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As regards supplementary work, trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacture was started last November.
Until last September he manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; his current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'called' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds able to moderate the spread of HIV in the organism
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some available medicines already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines are no longer working.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metal carbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all the medications used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘better' compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metal carbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bound by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscules of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in a test, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metalocarborans an interesting compound for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína ěezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is "spanish" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about his future existence.
ODS statements were identified by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for the analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to support himself in the minority, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The attitude of ODS and social democratization towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion Kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government's desire, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and the feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will revalue the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten resignation in the event of the adoption of the amended proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is your disappointment in the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to support itself on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with it, he told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS surrendered at the request of the Prime Minister
Mr Nečas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
In resigning from the term of office, he knew that in the coming months it was mainly a question of the Bolshevikization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Ferrocarriles) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More chances of linking to the capital will win, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - Písek line - České Budęjovice will circulate fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in drahy-planned transport is in the Hradec Králové region, 8% in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budęjovice track and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budęjovice line will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní Nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk/Jeseník circularan every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable loss Dráhy will receive the year to come four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains Drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed forces continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
Armed persons have now abducted 75 people in the South of the Philippines, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abducted.
All 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, armed people belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which caused the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the south of the Philippines, Maguindanao province was due to the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed by martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao also operate the Muslim separatists.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (their official title in Czech isInvictus: Neporažený) will be released in American cinemas, which captures a part of the biography of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid plays Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the leading role Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the Klerk Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa the preparations for the world football championship culminate. At the same time, the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of leading roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says, he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared me well to perform it.
I often met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as it is said - to collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated into the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long years separated. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist also puts the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the grammar in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans are however skeptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN a rugby amateur Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko it burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firemen in the Usti region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their minds and the fire are extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
No one had been injured, according to Pavla Mandatová, the company's voice, the failure does not jeopardize the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is turned off.
According to Mandatova it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps nothing similar happened, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the company ČEZ for the Northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps pęsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of the electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, also maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a slander complaint to three hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a slander complaint to three social-democratic hetmans.
These are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty minutes in Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company's efforts, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "taken the cake crusts," yet we brought only the offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim, that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left but to defend us.
It's because of slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence from all regions. According to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans who do so too.
I suppose that this time too will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional railway links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion kronas did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of ČSSD because of his criticism of ferrovian transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what is this gentleman, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumoccal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already views that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born from 2 August last year may receive the pneumoccal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, one quarter of families voluntarily left their children to be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Generally, the experts estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand kronor annually.
Without clutch they will save in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500 thousand annually on all vaccination of children.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of medium otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country each year die according to research in hospitals 28 children who are not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumoccal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Srše.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, the doctors say
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktuckých dętských lékařě Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, it can be reasoned for reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents leave their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
Pneumoccal vaccine is a great change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance."
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that paediatricians will invest in the 40,000 vaccines per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 paintings on his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Little Mountains.
Frazetta padre, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Bárbaro and Tarzan.
Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a deposit."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and cuts in the pre-budget report, against the criticism of the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the shortfall, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low-income and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 % increase in social security expenditure and a 1% ceiling in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow around three billion pounds a year, has enraged the business community, which states that this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLASSES OF THE BUDGETARY REPORT
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1 point increase in company tax for small firms was discarded
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and who wins £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will win £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be over 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax rises and delineated cost cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," she told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the labour party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would likely contract by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the 3.5 % decrease predicted in April, while the borrowing order would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Disposed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of a loan application of £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, avoiding "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and have wasted it."
"All major ads will be made after the elections, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater shorter-term deficit reduction.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money collected by tax increases and cost cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandcastles".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided with the most needed and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
False budget
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really delaying the pain later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, financial consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
The FBI investigates the "detention of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
Pakistan's U.S. Embassy told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it's investigating if they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia, U.S. state last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If you are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges on which you have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances you are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if these are indeed the students who were missing," said the spokesperson.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the detainees.
The Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on arrests, reported Reuters news agency; but said that the U.S. had to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "business"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally poor, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tens of persons have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak's detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"Falsa Confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container together with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's enquiries had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn Bristol's interest site into a competition track.
The Tray at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in the park of Brandon Hill there was a short jump ramp, opposite a track of 100 meters long.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view since the top of the track, but it was quite scary.
You see underneath a beautiful view of the city's lights titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Lay State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worries the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic Spaces".
He is a good listener who plays conversations between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seemingly mundane issues, he maintains, things of daily life, are the ones that concern the media more than the political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
The conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interview tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions to what extent the French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating picture in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knower of the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his moskete, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still usually a millionth part of the area of the wild adult's field. The climate is hardly ever suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore became green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its coat.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the massacre continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimal Indians in motorcycles use high-powered assault rifles to knock down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an ancient writer of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening account of Arctic science and a stunning look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of commitment.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the influential system inside the Arctic ice, formed by salt water chorrites that compress while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the ice of the summer is withdrawn, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in the tombs of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, where we are being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the road, to offend events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Enveloped in warm clothing layers, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to older tombs of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam's war, because they don't receive as many visits as new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couple took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstone.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied to the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, virtually remained silent.
The United Service Organizations (Asociation for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shady atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loudly sculpted names on the stones, while others bowed to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who washed the tears of his eyes in front of his son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one must ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A lot after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on clients' projects such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the United States Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered "hazardous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Graffiti anti-government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been looking for a "slowly-track" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost daily wages.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly unsuccessful.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as the distribution of free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as the leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials set up a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, stating that they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet for radicalized youth.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments by approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a family place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed of the case stated on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that men were not immuted and were even trying to get the appropriate approval to access the al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has placed the main priority of attempting to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting go those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that the Qaeda analyzes with special attention the applicant American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, because of their potential for access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model how many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has become a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "climate action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding the negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center in the city, bolder actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "the Earth says "now enough."
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's trips, his mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate changes that are already taking place. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to circumvent it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or by carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the awareness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's leading negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on each one's perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that it affects the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's federal scorebook on math performance was a very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the rating book showed that fourth- and eighth-degree pupils took a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of the fourth-degree white students in the D.C. over the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance difference actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the table is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was released, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances held by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set in response to those on the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping joy for a difference of two or three points, said the D.C. Council member, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need of attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real life experiences, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to whom some of the progress reported by ENPE last week is credited.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of creepy dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education teacher at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that run counter to that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, without taking into account where they live, are confident that their children will be able to access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
You have to get to almost 200 days to have the force of change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers as a "indicator" to seek a further increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot at a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the enrolment costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of potential enthusiast students.
Yes! This is where I will be!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Jesus, seriously?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide talked about the low school teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a very important role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural school affinity and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if efforts are sustained in time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is concluded that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement university training programmes, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until the completion of secondary school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Petroleum Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left behind having bided in only two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who filed an offer lost.
Two US companies reached agreements for auctioned fields in June.
The poor representation of the US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, drafter of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
The security concerns, accentuated by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and the political instability while the U.S. military retired, probably prevented the US oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the third most important crude reserve in the world, the analysts said.
American companies were in some cases disadvantaged because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have narrowed ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, moved away with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese State owned the National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be with its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that then confronted the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each field.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan-Afghan border has killed a major al Qaeda operating planner this week, said U.S. counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second fatal attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who is thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car near Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the place and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner from al-Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had rapidly ascended to the al Qaeda ranks and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of un piloted aircraft attacks led by the CIA has declined since summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a count of The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decrease may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while killing ruthlessly suspected informants, the site said.
Maximum UN sent to Kabul about to resign
The maximum United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of corruption spread in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months prompts other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who collaborate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better for them to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "safely damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism in terms of international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the assistance efforts of the United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, affirming that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, claiming that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to capture talent.
That's how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week trip in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, underscored the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would accept leaving a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that was desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have distanced itself from the tentative agreements, in part, the experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and unfounded accusations", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other global powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials cited Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shangai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aged population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the policy of a single child was introduced in China, creating two generations of well-known children, one-on-one malicious children, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six of when the policy was implemented, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very nice populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single Chinese child is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high innatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed further exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign was launched, the urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Shangai's disappointed officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the inadequate medical and life insurance provided to them by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a unique child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to all taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and really do not want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owned by a translation agency, explained it more vigorously.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years old grew up watching their parents fight during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he held.
A mother has to give up at least two years from her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to refurbish their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best kindergartens when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document that provides ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of global temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions from 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that demand mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the U.S. top climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's main powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it's not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking to contain the large issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional consultant on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks will produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, prepared a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "impacted political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government came to an agreement.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, descended from the aircraft and ran towards the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so that they could define the claims to be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre every day, activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that according to them are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 p.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed inter-urban train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first inter-urban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the time of business travel would shorten and the switching of aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres from a definitive route.
It is also expected that HS2 will establish three options for a larger high-speed network that is headed north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The favourite option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"This seems to be the most beneficial option," said one member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which would not be opened by 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital's space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to adapt to the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work was launched, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave the fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage by a £75,000 orange from a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district in Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee absolved him from violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the 75,000 pound loan.
The BRE's standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, which is now being found.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request £1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition to the House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive "rations" after the cost scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live from rations and be treated as m**rda."
He stated: "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't. "
The deputy, a millionaire for his former occupation as an oil dealer, was first questioned about his expenditures in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the sterling pound on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing himself that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about circumventing and criminalizing or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton beach palap
Brighton's palaps have found a new momentum for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palaps for each day of December, using villancics as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palap from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filling cakes and free ponche servings.
The villancics chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect as a Church that people will come to an old strange building? I believe that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Advent of the palate began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, all over the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, parade over the frozen Danish capital in claiming an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate throughout the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with docks and hammers, a journalist from the AFP reported.
The anti-disturbant police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent clusters that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The climate justice action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The fairly peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlewatch.
Most protesters came by car and by train from large European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with celestial squirrels responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that you can walk through as never before could be done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
The Pacific Asian region, which brings together many very vulnerable islands to warming, gave the initial steep wing to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and displayed slogans in favour of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed claiming to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5 pm GMT.
According to those responsible for the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58 per cent hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced from Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "lamented that Abkhazia had fallen under the full Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempted to demonstrate through this election that he was ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a nice white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to the Russian president and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his vodka glass.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one who gives Russia control to the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: world demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, parade in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December the delegates of 193 countries, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are under way.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlewatch.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, a journalist from the AFP reported.
The anti-disturbing police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent clusters that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adoquin, and four cars were burned near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, the spokesman of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, prevented them from flying over the area.
Most protesters, who arrived by car and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with celestial squirrels responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalisation figure, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
The Oxfam organization together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific Asian region, which brings together many very vulnerable islands to warming, gave the initial steep wing to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and displayed slogans in favour of solar energy in front of the City Council of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, the concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge "fortellicides" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all students of the first high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "stop with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be subramas of the C, he continues to underline even: "I didn't hear historians or intellectuals were indignated for having eliminated history and geography in secondary high school in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second C high school. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second C high school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will provide an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will perform real practice during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal College, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations of experts, filmed and open to the public, reported a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and conveys to them the desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," he told AFP Jean Jouzel, who presented without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's Internet site from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: Disgrace among prison guards, action planned
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end-of-year holidays, premiums and extra hours, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd guard union) requested out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "lock them" to thus denounce the theft of their possessions.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "reunite in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", for it is called "awkward and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convenes general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Department of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased greatly in 2009 and were not all accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellor's Office reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our penitentiary system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of Corrections to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours would not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budget demands," the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, he said outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking on more troops, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salary, he estimates the Bordeaux Prison CGT.
According to the trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, said the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "best gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end-of-year holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged family partner, will be the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program extracts transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding in humor pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in an atmosphere distracted by the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, then I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims to be in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pains and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday-Tursday night at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "lesions deriving from the operation" of hernia disc in Paris on 26 November, pointed out his press service in the same city, indicating that these injuries "need a repairing operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" would not have been introduced any cannula after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of the Monceau Park due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday because of an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's intimate friend, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but he said he wasn't making himself "no problem" because the rockman is "a fighter."
He called me right before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to make a 12-hour plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure that Johnny Hallyday "reacted successfully to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the wife of the musician, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was boarded for nine days following a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a "colon cancer" after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overreported. Fans and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives had, even, to deny a new placement.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Long Pool Worlds-2009, won an international title on Thursday in a distance that he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three records of the world were overcome when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand owned in long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a prime at the international level.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the record of the world was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathtubs from 1 January will be banned.
These bathing machines, originated in 238 world records since February 2008, end their epopey in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathing machines did not help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark at 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up in this race.
I knew this time I couldn't beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola was sold at US$ 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced the art marcher of Sotheby's.
This panel of 2 meters long for 63 cm high dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "who represents four dionisian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satire and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since there are only four or five in the world," he explained Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions from ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this batch was the most bided by the buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told the AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel formed part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Honduras aborted Zelaya's exit to Mexico
On Thursday Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, all seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take to Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as Head of State in the guest exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday to radio Globo, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the country of Central America for five months.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy filed an application for safe conduct, but unfortunately we couldn't accept it because we did not contain an asylum request, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilised the supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This reflects the marginality of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, on which day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he came back surprisingly on September 21 and went to the embassy of Brazil.
If you leave, you will be arrested and you must answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
De facto president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the polemic scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of its term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up this Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance are a faithful witness to economic reactivation both from the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell in October by 7.6 per cent compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts were expecting, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of volumes of trade, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment registrations in the United States were unexpectedly increased last week, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bonus was 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bonus to 4.492% versus 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power humiliate the "Women of White"
This Thursday hundreds of Cuban power supporters haunted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world's human rights day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were called.
About forty "Women of Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital claiming the release of those detainees, a journalist from the AFP held.
The U.S.s. die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" the power militants shouted at the dissidents with their fist on high.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed as civilians who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration unleashed against the "Women of White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, a journalist from the AFP reported.
The agents forcibly climbed the vehicles to the dissidents who were haunted by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Women of White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a sentence of 20 years' imprisonment.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
A very rare event in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of the government's militants against the "counter-revolutionaries" on Thursday.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenary with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs of the Seine) on Thursday at the hour of the most influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, at or in front of the pharmacy in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, reported police and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a member of the Alliance police union.
Then in or in front of the pharmacy, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about 30 years of age, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the seemingly affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was placed "in a state of shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the Jean Jaurès boulevard.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one 30-year-old man, and another 40-year-old.
At night, the crime scene was still unclarified.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed his back, explained in the place a member of the Alliance union in the Highs of the Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter in a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd fell upon him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
For the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, up to 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to the testimony of the police.
The facts occurred in one of the major arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous trades are found.
Some people came to tell me there was a man wounded on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. By putting him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, he told the AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of approximately 35 years of age arrived, with knife wounds.
National police personnel arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Highs of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of being placed in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of over-excitement" as "everything disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", reported to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at the same time, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was creepy."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have discussed with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before making a sentence, which constitutes a serious misconduct of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument presented in the first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of charges could be seriously evaluated while Roman Polanski was not brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for "illegal sexual relations" was handed down with a woman under the age of 13.
Since then, the United States has never stepped again.
Los Angeles District Deputy Officer Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to show up at the audience."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is the possibility of fleeing?, asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "will ask for a favor from the court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house prison in his cabin in Gstaad, pending any extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down on the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without heading, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 65.67 points reaching 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced from 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasing and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend remained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "help to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation," Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, US consumers' confidence was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months versus the euro, which "reduces sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bonus was 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bonus to 4.497% versus 4.492% on the eve.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month of South Africa tour, the 112 women candidates for the Miss World title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real upheaval.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!, said amazed Miss Sierra Leone.
This ninth event in South Africa will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 17h (15h GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with women candidates and the possibility of re-developing "African landscapes that take their breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bathtub.
The Chinese presenter, Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, women candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who held their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone observes.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Soccer World, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I treated people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 Worldwide, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," said his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday when he came down from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 pm local (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, distracted, assured that he would move "the sooner" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the operation of disc hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday because of an infection, which followed a discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was again operated on Wednesday night to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26 at the private international clinic at Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
It's a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, for I was operated twice as a disc hernia, he added.
Shortly earlier on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "existed without cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of brain bleeding.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, sentenced to justice on several occasions for malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, counsel of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Order Council, and is "away from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "were done without any disadvantage" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and, therefore, did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered a parenthesis.
Undoubtedly, returning to the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Office) on the acronym of the former giscardist party, inciting him to withdraw it from any support, so sorry to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF acronym, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after laying his hand on the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he was assisted by MEP Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce and transfer the property rights of the brand to them, with a penalty of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to regain the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the page of presentation of their site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you already know, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "withdraw immediately the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (his) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette to "transfer property from (the) brand to legitimate owners".
If not, justice will be appealed to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "choked" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore does not have any right to use the UDF acronym.
They also recall that the UDF's last congress voted in 2007 on its accession to MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he recorded the brand," he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It is shocking and fraudulent to take advantage of the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expolise her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy process over one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the reigns of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87, be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder always refused to submit such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010 in which they will have to state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weaknesses and during which periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, she said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, leaving the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane's only daughter Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for his part, always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, who he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the arguments of the lawyers were sometimes a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I could never talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office considered, once again, that the complainant was not in a position to appear, the more so as a guardian's judge refused, in the last few days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would be decided after the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managing Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is about the collaborators to adhere to "values" identified from above as it was previously about imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of markets... though the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the customer's preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved to have proactive behavior and a prospective vision"; it needs a commitment from employees that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting the collaborators at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among his employees, incite the administrative revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
"In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
As they come from the large schools of engineers, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient conductist theory that the U.S. "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Studies Institutes and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" of the executives' commitment, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanical management, unadapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employees' motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "on site".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo's speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies, acclaimed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and she added that she had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former president of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich declared, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican instigation for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting itself as "the citizen of the world," as "always does," "he spoke as an American president" when reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right, a Bush-era falcon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "monoton, pretentious and inspiring" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the press in the center of the left praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, described his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said the Californian newspaper enthusiastically.
Obama "proclaimed the speech that was necessary," the New York Times estimated, judging him "to the same time as grim and edifying."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations sessions, the trade unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer's organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat posed by Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the State Secretary of Transports, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" for the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the text in agreement at the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) retired with a portrait.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very damaging to companies" and "there was fear of disturbing the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from €8.72 to €9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, let's give our militants the order that there be no more cuts or blockages in the supply centres.
But there may always be some disgraceful rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was a "good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest wages.
It is an agreement with common sense and respects the employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages an increase of 3 per cent in travel costs and the holding of general assemblies on road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of EUR 100 million in employer burdens" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill of amending finances for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to undertakings that are affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the shortest time," said Bussereau.
Opposition by employer organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "ingenuity trade", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an urgent situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Onestra regretted.
For OTRE, the agreement jeopardizes "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions dissenting with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the trade unions were dissatisfacted with their request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will circulate between 10 hours and 20 hours, at the rate of a train of each two in the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of every four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to switch trains.
The Lafayette Gallery, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, was happy that "the RATP strives to provide service to the big stores".
RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, SNCF indicated that it had envisaged the supervision of police and law enforcement officers.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or intended for it arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metres.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, will be analyzed from a meeting held with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers want to claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, commented indignantly on the CGT, pointing out that the address "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of the profession", the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "doesn't care about the users of the weekend."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independent have submitted a notice.
Trade unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers daily.
The drivers of RER, all in the second grade of their career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for shifts with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main prokurdo party, a decision that immediately provoked rage manifestations in the Kurdish community, in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just given a hand to the Kurdish community in trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus on activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, said Kiliç, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and the deputy Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision arises as a result of a procedure initiated by the Supreme Court's prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party asserts that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at the time the government tends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders affirmed that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in South-East Anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the PKK chief's detention conditions, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into confrontations with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the Southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or deep stones.
In Istanbul, approximately 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurda, NDLR) dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, said Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision fully boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is at all something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says FES' winter road maintenance director
But by doing so, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
Maybe on the weekend the meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called sections A with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
For example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also accesses for the body of firemen, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and stretches with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better adhered to.
That's why the FES starts around three o'clock in the morning, "so the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear up space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger knows well.
About five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Usually the FES could not take over all the bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these slips quickly, the vehicle with salt starts as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cunning of the Dinosaur
The Tawa finde had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters tall running on the two strong back legs, had an elongated head with sharp teeth and curved, short arms with clutches in the form of a hose and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, this would not have been something special.
But Tawa finde was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is unprecedented for Triasic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the god of the Hopi Indian sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropodes among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropodes known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivoros (sauries with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa finde is a primitive theropode.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also owned by the descendants of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa he also finds the bones of the spine were evidently filled with air partially.
Tawa is the most ancient and primitive air bag theropode, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the Sauries emerged there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages were separated at the beginning and spread from South America through all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique earthly mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa the remains of two other theropodes not very closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe at least three waves of migration to North America, Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn Martin Sander's paleontologist.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a riddle.
Meanwhile, in the Triasic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the present crocodiles and the pterosaurus and with many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship extinct on the edge of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Successful stories weren't eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact stopped the boom of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California are participating.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt had an impact on the whole world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, though also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an "an unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverted attention from content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also support the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi's national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden Province.
We are understanding of the protest, but we are not understanding of vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the student's arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg Scientist's headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Various mutual visits took place and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
Deputy Moscow Mayor Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the Chief of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the possibility of putting a foot on the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograduate is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for Arms Research.
Selenograd (translated literally as "Green City") was named after the landscape of wooded mountains, where research facilities were set up.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at that time 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since ancient times a huge amount of time was needed to hook the locomotives backwards forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about halfway through the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Charter of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer more compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impagable to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more problems with entry and exit since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE section built towards Ulm will already be initiated.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged so.
Railways continue, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more ecological than trucks on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for load trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking on other narrow crossings and passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-step tracking has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as appropriate.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport judgment.
The federal government pending in the Autonomous Parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is to file an appeal before the Hesse administrative court ruling on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH judgment, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had established in writing at this date that in the case of the construction of the northwest airway planned at Frankfurt airport, the Federal State would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January whether it will bring an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal before the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of banning night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We do our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federative government would be trying through distortions of law and tricks still to get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally untachiable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group's claims about the night air traffic ban.
The US banks return the aid provided.
The major US banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" once returned the aid provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the US CNBC.
With this the institutes seek to get rid of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as limiting the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as paying high fees.
The "Bank of America" had earned approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had a number of means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult moments.
The bank house had miscalculated the investment bank absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money on the capital market so that it can free itself from its state obligations.
CNBC reported from a well-known source of circles that the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June they had already returned their aids Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
In the end, everything was faster than it was thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Yesterday night the union intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially in order not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the failure to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the federation.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew for another five years Nikolaus Brender's contract.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in their position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, that under Brender's leadership the ZDF information would have lost audience indices.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF flourished.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had even been involved in the debate, which described Koch as an unconstitutional proceeding.
But it didn't work.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romantic philology.
He then worked on the radio station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's dismissal, which was still elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opposite in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhine-Palatinado, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of supportive politicians from the ZDF control federations was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, recommended himself to the administrative council with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the federation for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter could appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a second supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the liberals on the left.
University Race Clears
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave up. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's degree and master's degree.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module in the race must be completed with one single exam.
It also aims to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making structural rules in a more flexible way for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, must no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of universities are constantly talking about the improvement of being able to successfully complete a career (studentability).
Now, for the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in configuration in the future.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These should be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
Ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinada has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counselling programmes, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Federal State and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, only one test should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about its "studentability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
In addition to the praises, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialists) university groups, it was demanded that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of the university ministers and rectors.
No later than after the education strikes, students as the main participants should now be able to think as well.
The president of the Board of University Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported students: "We need students' experience," said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW), Bonn's agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student under the Bachelor's degree to have access to a post-Master career.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum at Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he spoke quite a bit last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of colleagues from German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had slowly begun in early 1971.
"So I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the attempts to provoke fear of the Securitate," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and his unequal literary controversy with dictatorial dominance mechanisms, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken for a case that shows the abyss and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only a author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
He had excused him or defended him at all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly " Zeit", after having read his own 914-page file.
Those involved would probably have speculated and would have known in some cases, what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and Walter as well.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of the Securitate control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate (CNSAS) files, for the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is more of a trace.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke despisedly of the condecorate.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning around in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there are silent faults.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desires of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When Stuttgart's new VfB football team coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's provider, boarded a Mercedes C class taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was leaving a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, nor was the 55 - year - old man drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, which had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth end," i.e., in the Champions League, thanks to triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves blind for success: we will have to brutally fight the descent."
"The much more important task" awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league will need to be repeated in Magnia.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The eighth end of the Champions League (parties 16/17 and 23/24 February/parties 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of Babel's successor's fulminating entrance was kept limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired them to the confusing Stuttgart's self-confidence, ready to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had an effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impetus emerges in football, sometimes things that would not have been believed possible happen."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to becoming the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenus" perceived with the proverbial "fresh vent" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and administrator also abstained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relay and totally overrun by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, he thought Khedira.
And director Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the weekend events, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which the porter Jens Lehmann had granted.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coaching because of the pressure of adolescent fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the slumber.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible to show the great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the unison; and the man of the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning mourning in Bern: over and over again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC Association's version defeated American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) in Bern on Friday-Saturday night.
Klitschko was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be done.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before some 17,000 viewers in the Arena of Bern, Klitschko, with a height of 2,02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was evading over and over the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right-wing goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and he just tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
When weighing, the champion was allowed to provoke on Friday to take Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to surrender without fighting.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his defenses of the title, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after the latter dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, of 2,13 meters in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposingly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar, due to false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftist demand explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz's air strike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), having deceived with knowledge of cause.
In the news broadcast "Tagesschau" on Saturday, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "witnessly hadn't told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it had been reported that this attack was not only about destroying the trucks abducted, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to pronounce immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of Afghanistan's federal government policy, and whether the Chancellorship, the Army and the Information Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellorship did not influence any concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also raised doubts about the presentation by the Ministry of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both had informed Gutenberg about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, it transcends that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defence the existence of a number of reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday with regard to the reproach that is being made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Oniric Worlds
In a state of vigil, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts, the limits between imagination and reality vanish.
As long as it happens during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can unhinderedly surrender ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experiences sleep-like states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
The blame has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality undibushed.
Onionically modified alert states can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the shamanic possession states, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal substances of communication in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied the philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great likeness of the state of madness with the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproportionate formations, and mirrors of it."
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mules like blood, deforms, rechining teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over the body.
Striking and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, binds them to form a knot hanging, and fixes them on a hook on the roof.
He goes up on a horn and puts his knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope drops.
What a lesson!, the voices scream in a choir that blows his timps, "Go to the clinic and make you heal!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also maniac-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially extended is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head doctor at the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the space and sensory structure of reality that are perceived in psychosis remain in principle such."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, there's still an unknown reason why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is also not manifested at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitting system of the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical thing about this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor in psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and craneoencephalic traumas.
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are uncoupled; when our brain warms, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and went to a secondary school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it happens that a clumsy boy with long and dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her blown; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and goes and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you're in class sometimes you can't follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often arrives late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the mules or the girl with bloody cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 today.
She approved last year of selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Ever since he's been in contact on the Internet with psychologist Kasten, he knows he's not crazy.
Madness is also a despairful work of art.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is responsible for looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a unique daughter, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he found out that the man he calls Dad since he's used the reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "is occurring in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that your patients appreciate your hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too consciously focused, imaging experiences usually become pathologizard, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head doctor at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of despair art.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Onyric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Onionic conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully aware. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or of the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a world of its own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of limit situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unsafe situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his onyric experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days' journeys after a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen submerged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself lying in bed, an older man on board a healer on a train, a robot watched for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed over his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describing his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will take care of the publishing house at 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put his children before 7,500 workers, if they are not sufficiently qualified to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from January from the chairmanship of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52-year-old Kallen family member has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and thus came the responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took over the direct marketing, the foreigner, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are also not safe from the decay: "This has always affected families that get infected by the desire to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great delusions," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor in this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish - in matters of beauty and well-being - within the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teateria stands out, with more than 130 different classes from this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and taking a little champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully customized treatment.
It all starts by introducing your personal key to a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including warming and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Miscellaneous narrows
Christmas is approaching and it's never much to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party dressing room.
The shape of the hatch, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated necklace.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logic for Electric Vehicle Implantation) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements about mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to push forward what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to boost the installation of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets in a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a scene of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants," said the government president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in enrolments, which grew by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classical vehicles
The first edition of the International Chamber of Classical Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motor mould fans.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Mos Classics and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Classic Cochera, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior skill tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sport is not conflicted with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note reached in its entirety.
The finishes, the end of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front seats present excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the steering wheel's touch is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the box of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic as well.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the room, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
A large, regular trunk is added to this.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse gasoline engine and with the manual six-way change.
This engine is an authentic delight. It excels for its fineness, for its reduced rumours, for its performances and for achieving content consumptions.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometres a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for their high comfort of movement, and for their consumption content.
With regard to the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
The serial equipment specially excels the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the onboard computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in case of little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon lights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It highlights especially the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only inconvenient of this model is its high price, which is located between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high number, the Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shone more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, not even to see some type of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has pulled out two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six more times for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-priced roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Physical PhD to understand them and some good glasses to read the small lyrics.
The repeated European Commission ear tyres to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly.
That a device like FonPeek (it does not stop being curious to wear the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of fee means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other online queries.
No contracts and no gaites.
It's a connected device and it's paid for when you buy it, not a month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime shopping option like Peek already has in America.
Not because I'm gonna buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a more just model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred tone of the first American lady.
If he has already come to the takeover of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections - the dress was made up of three pieces - dressed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with printing.
The supplements have also varied: green shoes of half heels last time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected on this occasion, melena looses the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundad and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the field of work due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of couple life and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start conviving with a couple before, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have less offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after cohabitation, which increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity although less on the schedule of matching," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and have the first birthplace.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age they marry and the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"A further division between women is established depending on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a pre-marriage condition and the arrival of a child," Delgado details.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, singing the universal slogan of 'Because I Worship It'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, joins other famous films by L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (company of Evangeline in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of his awards, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent regains in 'Póquer de Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirtieth of X-rays of writers who have passed their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the foreseeable and fearful genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save fears or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and reelectures.
Here's a few snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulsion, the same as I felt without giving him a name: the pleasure against the thorny destiny, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a splendid, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotion of adultery conjured with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best alpines are decriminalized over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cricket from a bridge by that character from Munich to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he got on his knees and prayed, 'God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/after the storm the port,/the rest after the war,/after the life weary pleased death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness has never been given."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years of age, walked our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed along with her and our dog, a piece of mixed race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, gave her two kicks that left the dog badly wounded.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small and defenceless animal, which by the way was tied.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a woman to walk quietly and that, when she unbelieved these individuals, she came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic attacking an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt would be useful for much and not to generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the cowards killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun free to abuse an defenceless animal that gives us affection, company, and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people remain.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorists, today reported both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injury or even death in the event of an accident while circulating on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing products more and more safely" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed to more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main purposes is to develop more and more secure products.
Upload the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to the figures of the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not osbtant, should be quarantined as the reference to which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
The result is that, despite the upturn of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: cars derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
In addition to the restrictions posed by the closed tap of bank loans, other factors such as the rise in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has very little been served.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who will acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can be granted, but the number of operations has been attesting.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need for special attention from the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industry (cars and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with anti-locking ABS brakes and passing through with ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly enrolled light commercial cars and cars, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant is doing more pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's tray.
But he doesn't always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, however, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four would be avoided with harm to people - when the so-called smart emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays the Opel plan until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends is that each of the points of the plan has previously been agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to have contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but he takes hold of the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
To the Porsche Boxster Spyder wheel
To develop his last, and face jewelry, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to avoid, first of all, the automatic ceiling that has been sucked by one of the canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminium doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, they won 7 kilos more; mounting sports baskets another 12 and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, resigning the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door shooters for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on California secondary roads, in mountain stretches with really reversed tracks
Their behavior can only be classified as untachable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with splinter.
Rather, the opposite: we hadn't tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much security in the step by the curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles in a short march during the necessary time, until we order him to print, brake, retrieve and squeeze his engine again...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 bóxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is well achieved and can be powered with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifys the engine bramide, already premiered in the Pannamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stopping or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the baches well.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, and it enters in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun driving cars you can in the market and that is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's Intima, an image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer brings her face with as much contours as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Gives One Victory in Israel
The Labor Fund achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team was counted, and in this way it is located in the leadership of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight annotated triples was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Vitorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to take place with the victory.
In addition, the great right from the perimeter, with 16 triples annotated had much to do with the final triumph.
The game began face to face for the bluegranes, which were put from the beginning ahead on the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians were from the perimeter already made it presagiar that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Lavese team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with spices and applause in the return to which it was his home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' valuation already made it presage that this was not going to be the Brazilian's best night.
But the party, despite being on track at rest, was not decided much less and the Macabeans wanted to remind the Vitorians that in their field no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' tightening they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turn of the 'yellows' to the luminous (50-49).
More Inconveniences
Ivanovic's, wounded but not much less dead, had to pull a couple of right-handed moves to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a tranquilizing income (54-67), who managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The wings went out to leave their skin in the last part and English and St. Emetery (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by mistakes, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned it and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaja strikingly lost in Greece before the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of the Euroliga group B, in a match marked by the casualties of the caysts, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, shredded the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned to the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, conato de lucha, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek group began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were hurting the cashiers.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian allero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Hit
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even came to equalize the difference of the encounter disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leader tambalize.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last fall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconvenience the Unicaja for Cook's leadership and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters inside the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to date the average basket 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, handing over the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the highest number of classified real estate, employment and motor ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates user wages from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros per year and one French, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 received by one Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 net euros per year; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil puts date on Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president shall leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when he or she formally terminates his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, when he finishes his mandate, he must seek another destiny."
The station also cited the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the elections of 29 November (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
This same week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's political asylum status, which was intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions on the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at close to zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodoxical liquidity policy, they start throwing some sand into gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodoxive measures and we are assisting in a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have remarked, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was re-affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that it arrived Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward review of the Kingdom of Spain rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not come wrong to silence the moral risk advocates who were once again attempting to create a position of conscience over those responsible for global economic policy because they have curtailed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the Emirates to recombinate power in the Emirates and what we have seen in Greece before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro country to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials extend as European corporate bonds must not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic risk in Spain.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not add much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "prudence, friend driver".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is being discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the subcommission at closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and power will have to be increased.
Its stake focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW new ones are needed, that is, with other "support energy."
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has just adopted is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point measures", as Iberdrola's president called them.
Whatever the case, Galan believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must start to be taken as they take a long time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of the Irish airline's preferred partner Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, which has not transcended the economic terms, lasts for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The partnership provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Actions dispute your first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Action struggles for its first concession motorway in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately €1,047 million).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concessionaire of motorways.
City Council wants to get it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan hosted by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the projected investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase, three consortia with a notable presence of European builders compete.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in league, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, settled in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Acciona plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the criba is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (philiac of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but it involves a clear entry difficulty if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has barely achieved a position in that market through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Million dollar assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it is already prominently present through its activity as an energy provider and in the business of disallation.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the decontaminator of Adelaida, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called to unite the western Toowong motorway with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in the traffic of Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It shall include two lanes per sense, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers Hochtief business
Australia continues to yield remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who yesterday announced the conclusion of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will provide quick internet access to 400,000 people and will give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey Tower King George in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The signature gets this contract days after it is done with the works of expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and their implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Rushmore for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator informed.
The contract reflects the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from the 16 agencies that were submitted to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A total of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile phones with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulatory framework.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulated more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and is therefore re-incidence.
Application store
Moreover, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and the Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main revenue sources of the big clubs.
So much so, the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to data from UEFA.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well stood out of this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that the most money has been packed for participating, and the only one, next to AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed more money for participating in the past Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chairing Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous classification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There is also a bonus to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team).The eighth financiers will receive three million each; the eight fourth financiers, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, versus 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, was embossed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion left 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group New Rumasa demolished yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a peak of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (OP) for all titles.
In particular, New Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros for action that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be reimbursed with interest for such postponement of 1% annually
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer valued the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' actual valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezan group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay away from possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavenes of their former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high office in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to the societies of the Salazars.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new deviations of funds
With regard to the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representants of CCM and Unicaja) declared at the National Audience that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes Paternin's exclusion opa that presented Mer Investor
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion op submitted by Mer Investor on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the existing rules and considering the content of the explanatory brochure submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the finalisation of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions in force.
New tools to inherit cars
In these days of time and accidents, they won not only the car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No accident is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated job.
Calculate manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and handwork, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minor importance.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Services providers and solutions for sinister valuation and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, then preparing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
GtMotive and Eurotax are the other companies that compete in the field of evaluation and information development tools.
Work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the number of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that more versions, variants and motorizations have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes out to the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, a graphic image of each model is made "intelligent" where different parts of tourism can be "pinned".
If it's a salesmass model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are Porsche information, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park circulating, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for dismantling parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard valuation solution of sinisters, for experts.
Includes light or heavy cars, motorcycles and industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to push for the declared total sinister vehicles.
Your statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses, or knowing the deviations by omodel brands.
For example, how many models of a given brand have passed through the workshop due to faults or how many have suffered serious sins in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Rating Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 was established in Spain.
According to sources of the company 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2 per cent more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares amount to a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of accident cars
Last October the group Solera bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorbikes or sinister special vehicles.
The operation amounted to a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with access to an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scraps and professional vendors who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and some 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose number of frames has been discharged cannot be recycled, but can be used as a spare part for certain parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even though they have been discharged after some far-reaching efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement, creating a budget and generating a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals, who, to a greater or lesser extent, are often more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 roads, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model is identified to be repaired by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables such as the labour price, surcharge or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
