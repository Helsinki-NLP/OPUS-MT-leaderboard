This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but the details that fossils don't usually give, for example, the color and the three-dimensional schedule are enabled.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's feathers was chestnut brown, and the lower side is pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed feather expert called rachis, but it has other features of feathers - erasers of the 1st and 2nd order - researchers have concluded that the expert is likely to have developed later in evolution in relation to not these other features.

Even though there were three people in the house when she was hit by a car, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road on which the crash took place was temporarily closed as the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adecoya has been at the first-degree court in Edinburgh on charges of the murder of her son.
He's in custody waiting for charges and a trial, but there's a chance that the eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media have published her photo.
It is an established practice all over the United Kingdom, but the judiciary in Scotland works differently and the courts considered the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "it seems that journalists are dancing on a dangerous wire for the publication of photos of etc. suspects."
The Crown's Office, which is in charge of all criminal proceedings, has announced to the press that they will not make further comments until at least the indictment is brought.
The document, according to information leaked, will refer to the border dispute, for which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the Middle East War in 1967.
Other topics discussed allegedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence over ten years after the signing of the contract, and the Palestinian self-government agrees with a military presence of only five years.
The test hunting hunters would be under close supervision of the park guards to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme, as part of the partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Hunting Association of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, four shooters who were chosen to perform the first hit operation received extensive security guidelines and training.
Martelly took an oath yesterday to the temporary election council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary election council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited the CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that started in October.
Sometimes violent protests have launched the absence of elections to be held since 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPod have been reported to overheat, which has caused six fires, and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was familiar with 27 device-related accidents.
"Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that Apple informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents, which is not serious for the company."
"The ministry called Apple's delay" "truly sad." "
The earthquake hit the Mariana islands at 7: 19 pm local time (21: 19 h GMT on Friday).

Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at tourists from his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and older, were released early as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins took his father's footsteps and started his career in medicine.
He was trained as an outcast and started working at a national hospital for women in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate early labor in his spare time.

Since 1400 respondents before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to the proposal for Australia to become a republic since 2008 has increased by 8%.
The interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the polls share the same position and believe Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian ruler.
29% of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold Olympic medal was supposed to swim in races at 100 and 200 m free style and in three clubs at the Commonwealth Games, but his health is in question due to complaints.
He couldn't take pain meds because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and a professor of IT at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on the ground, along with organic substances that can form proteins and maintain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets are created, especially how the Earth was created, which comets collided with long ago.
Cuomov's (53) mandate started earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill last month that legates same-sex marriages.
"Rumors he called" political gossip and nonsense. ""
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow the flight routes to be shortened, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike the older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport option will be organised and the above-ground trains will not be stopped at Wembley. Also, vehicle parking facilities and parking and use of public transport at ground level will not be available.
Because of the fear of lack of transport, the possibility has emerged that the game would have to move to a closed-down without fans.
A survey published on Thursday in Science reported the development of new species of birds on the Ecuador islands of Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species developed within only two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer, due to the intersection between endemic Darwin's zeba, Geospiza fortes and the arrivals from the genus of the zeb, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in all possible forms. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be curled and knit. It can be knocked with a hammer or rolled into a plane.
"It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it is used to decorate hand-painted images in books called" "painted manuscripts."
It's called chemical pH.
Rasol changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is (lute).
The value of pH is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ion (H in the pH abbreviation) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are electrons-free protons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powder, then squeeze them into the ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause you to create a shell.
In Harappa and Moheng Daru, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of sewage systems were found in the construction of mineral cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
The toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. During Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women were mixed in societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent to space. Scientists in the universe use a telescope because the Earth's atmosphere is distorted by light and view.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, it takes a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel made the world an unthinkable change, and the biggest change was that the invention of the wheel allowed us a much easier and faster transport.
He made it possible to invent trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including home cats) eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is in the concept of niche, that is, a special position taken by a particular cat, so it does not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called herds.
The pack of lions consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually related and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion's pack acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (although not well), swim, skip a great distance and pull five times the size of a man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (brand of panther) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of the voice of the lion, but more like a series of incomprehensible, exalted words.
The oceans eat little animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, almost all the animals that the oceotes hunt are much less than themselves.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find animals that eat (prey) by smelling where the prey was moving on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with night vision and move very inconspicuously. The ocelots hunt prey so that they rate with the environment and then jump prey.
When a small group of living beings (small population) are separated from the main population from which they came (for example, during the crossing over a mountain or river or if they move to a new island that they can't easily return from), they will often be found in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs features or adjustments that are different from the present to be able to compete for resources.
The original population has not changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it is less like another population.
Over time, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in the appearance that they will not be able to call themselves the same species.
This process is called a specialty, which means the formation of new species. The speciality is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe and then take carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes out of plants, most of the foods we eat are plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the main predator in his time so he wasn't afraid of anything but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had over 70 sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, which means there was no help to anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a slobbering tongue, and his diet consisted of turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe there was a cannibal.
He was attacking everything that would get in the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex would be a match for him.
Although most of their food would have been known to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild pigs, peacocks, snails and puffs.
The second difference was that the poor and the women ate sitting on the chairs, while the rich men enjoyed the common feasts at which they would eat on the side.
The meals of ancient Romans could not contain the ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia over the next centuries.
For example, they didn't know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered a house of God.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods, offering ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open yard and an inner shrine that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids shaped towers, so called zigurates, which were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was especially the sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate conditions of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew families took place in the open.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were open to the road. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so the tree was extremely expensive.
Greenland was rarely inhabited. Norwegian saga said that Erik Red, after being expelled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and named it.
Regardless of his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
"Although each country was" Scandinavian, "there are many differences between people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down. "
No one knows for sure who wrote this big document on the parchment (dimension 29 js 24 ½ inch), but it is known that soon after the production is unbundled for storage purposes.
So, probably that record was added simply as a mark.
The landings as part of D-Day and the fighting that followed were released from the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
There were French people from the "Vishi France." These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked South France. The attack is known as Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces have released southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together - society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilization," which means civil, and it refers to a Latin civilian, which means a citizen, and a civilian, which means a city or a city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
Cities-states are a state-run. Civilized culture implies transferring knowledge from generation to generation, cultural trail and even expansion.
Less cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we don't recognize them as real civilizations.
During the American War on Independence, 13 countries first established a weak central government that consisted only of Congress by the constitutional act of the Confederate Act.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no state or judicial authority, when implementing all acts, it was relying on authorities who often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to revoke tax laws and customs between countries.
The amendment to the Treaty required a unanimous consent from all countries, and the central authorities did not take it seriously, so their representatives were most often absent.
The Italian football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, football, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports is the most popular in northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honša), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Since it consists of a group of islands, Japan is often called" archipelago "from the point of view of the geographical profession."
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors wrote down the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, "a beautiful island."
In 1624, the Netherlands East Indian company established a base in Southeast Taiwan and launched a transformation of Aboriginal practices in the production of cereals and employs Chinese workers to work on rice plantations and sugar cane.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly takes over the management of the Taiwan Western and North Coast Area and declares Taiwan as the province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed an agreement in Shimonoseki to hand over the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun and Room with three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were re-built to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally created.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu and the renovation continued.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the main size of the film at the end of the era of analog film.
It is produced today, but more importantly, the same ratio has the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a little confusing that the 35-millimeter format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the width and height of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed by simple numbers) is therefore 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are the same or most approximate to this scale of width and height of the image.
The rule of a third that is often broken and ridiculed is a simple guidance to create dynamism with a certain retention of order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main object on the intersection of lines that divide the image into third and horizontal (see example).
During this period, the European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church, became the subject of criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries that have different languages and customs.
The great power of Christianity has affected everything from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be applied to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty and that the church's funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflicts, the United Kingdom began a naval blockade of NJemac.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civil supplies, but the blockade has violated a generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole parts of the ocean, which has also caused danger to the ships of neutral sides.
As there was no too much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens and people were dominated by the pacifist attitude and separation.
After having experienced horrors and atrocities during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid this situation happening again in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous job) sent to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of showing different time periods; every phase of China or any family that was able was a recognizable dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the epoch of the Trio kingdom that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During this period there were fierce wars among nobles in the battle for the throne.
The three kingdoms are one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China; thousands died fighting for the highest place in the great palace Xi'an.
The consequences of social and political character, such as the use of a metric system, are the shift from absolutism to republicism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not the ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men and the most ambitious and successful, the opportunity for success was given.
The same goes for the army because after the revolution, the acts were given on the basis of their ability, not their class.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to launch their own revolution.
"Muhammad was very interested in questions beyond the limits of his boring life. The cave that became known as" Hira "on the mountain" Noor "(light) visited to think better."
The cave that has survived throughout history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know for sure that it exists, and once you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
You can't see anything but a clean, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist.
Keops' pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramid buildings built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Vioravan Giza or "Necropolis in Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx. "
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Kufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives of Pharaoh Kufu and members of his family.

The sign for up means to start from the top and push the bow, and the sign for down means to start from the frog (where we hold the bow hand) and pull the string.
The raised string usually creates a softer sound, while the lower tilt is stronger and more intrusive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the motion marks are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be followed.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth forced a bunch of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a bunch of people screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the mob before a terrified queen swung the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was changed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippines government.
Of course, the superprofit caused by the long-term exploitation of the Philippines will create the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar, we must understand the context of the order.
The age of these events is usually called the developed Middle Ages, which is a period of European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
The developed Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, followed by a late Middle Ages that ends in the convention about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological incentives or technological imperative to the strict notion that human fate is led by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is much above cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the car is necessarily leading to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not paid for just a few cars, so new ways of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars leads to a number of road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care for the treatment of injuries.
In romance, there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shapes an individual, and over time, the customs and culture related to geography, which is consistent with the physical residence of society, are therefore better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the capital of modern world fashion, Costantinople was considered the capital of the fashion of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400th to 1100 BC.
The status deteriorated in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had more value than the one offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of Gothic style was between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, the styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of the time as a result of the crusades was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-supply agriculture is to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their / her family.
Self-supply agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses the seed of the indigenous ecosystem in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers have dealt with self-supply agriculture, which is still true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite the same-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary by age, ethnicity, class, location and / or gender of members.
The qualities that make some subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or combination of factors.
Subculture members often show their belonging to a recognizable and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the methods that most often illustrates the importance of socialisation is the indication of an example of the unfortunate cases of children who have not been through socialization during growing up, either as a result of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultured or wild. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, leaving a child is a result of parents' refusal to have a severe intellectual or psychological damage.
Wild children can experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are assumed to have been raised by animals, and some have allegedly lived alone in the wild.
If he was fully raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the physical limits) that are almost entirely like the behavior of the animal that raised him, such as fear of people or indifference to people.
Although learning on the project should make learning easier and more interesting, the setting of the scaffolding goes one step further.
The setting up of a scaffolding is not an educational method, but a support for individuals who have a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is a shape of a scaffolding, as well as an animated stapler that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual setting of the scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended for testing, posting and explaining procedures that may be too challenging for the student to solve themselves.
Children are placed in a foster system for different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but this is still happening.
We believe the foster system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is required to provide safe homes, care care care, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are missing from the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are listed as important motives for the use of the Internet (James and Sur, 1995).
"When exploring visitors' reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also established" personal engagement "and" continuous relations "as new motivational aspects."
The use of the video has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to make out whether a particular person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his work the president's speech, claims that people who can't understand the speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess his honesty.
He had a hunch that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Studies in the 20th century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and pronounced.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from a set of distinct variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between the two sources.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system similar to human are difficult to meet the need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: less growth, poor diet and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were the proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but contains large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When all is considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors have solved the issue of protein intake in almost the same way as the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Discontinuation of sleep is a process of deliberate awakening during a normal sleep period and a re-going to sleep shortly after (10 - 60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to get you conscious without fully waking up.
If you realize you're turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed and turn it off.
Other bioritmic options include consuming a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which makes you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in opposite correlation with the amount of tension of her body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
All that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is extended by the Mahian path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of comprehensive love.
Kundalini yoga arouses kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) using yoga position, breathing exercises, mantra and visualization.
The divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleaned, they activate chakras and create awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to co-operation between the USSR and the United States. After the war, the difference between systems, procedures and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the war ended, former allies became enemies and began the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would lead him to a really well-equipped army on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had a collapse, and the only hope was to pull back and restructure along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans failed almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of the eastern Polish regions, violating the Peace Agreement from Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Attack Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The transport of goods by boat is certainly the most effective way in which a large number of people and a large amount of goods can cross the ocean.
The role of the Navy was traditionally to ensure that your country maintains the possibility of moving people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans have tried to transport human and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mostly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably managed to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
The goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the mountains of Zagros in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to grow them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The tame goats were usually kept in the herds that wandered the hills and other pastures, and were guarded by the so-called goats, usually children or adolescents, which is the name of the shepherds who guard the goats. These livestock methods are used today.
The tracks for the horses that were dragged were built in England back in the 16th century.
Although the first wooden tracks for the wagons consisted only of parallel floorboards, they allowed horses to pull the wagons higher speed of movement and to pull more cargo than it would have been possible on more humpback roads from that time.
The thresholds were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually seen that the tracks could be more effective with iron at the top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear-out of wooden wheels.
In the end, iron wheels replaced the wooden ones. The first fully iron tracks were presented in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (an upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecs, usually didn't walk upright.
The bipedal walk occurs at the australopithek about 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthopus was walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more in line with the environment, we can join the environmental movements and we can even be activists to sort of reduce the suffering in the future.
In many cases it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not looking for a solution that is only temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed very much thanks to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems are growing due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of people.
After Congress adopted a manuscript on July 4th, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, he then sent a few blocks away at John Dunlap's printing store.
The night was made between 150 and 200 copies that are now known as "Dunlap broadband."
The document was first read by John Nixon, on 8 July in the yard of the Independence Hall building.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th.
25 copies of Dunlap that are known to still exist are preserved copies of the document. The original hand-written is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and live even today. We call them birds.
Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But a lot of bird characteristics look like those of a dinosaur.
They have shells and claws on their feet, lay their eggs and walk on two back legs like T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Inner poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic chemicals for the household.
On the label, look for special instructions for the first-aid kit related to this poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in an official way for this group of insects.
This term comes from well-known bedbugs, insects that are very well adapted to parasizing people.
The killer's bedbugs and ordinary bedbugs depend on their hosts, whose nests or residential areas they live in.
In the United States, about 400 000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, which makes it a leading neurological disease in people younger and medium-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the chance of getting multiple sclerosis from men.
The couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or their child's best interest.
You know, couples like that can give their kid up for adoption.
When you adopt, biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can raise a child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works with a scientific method. This method is actually a guide for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that represent tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also direct scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks fell, the West broke ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many reported rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological classes.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not only a response to external cyclical incentives, have been discovered in most living beings, including bacteria, mushrooms, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the free cycle period even if there are no external signs.
The experiment that Hershey and Chase performed was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phases, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that showed DNA in the phase with radioactive phosphorus or a protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations may have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material and whether the affected cells are germinative lines.
Only mutations in sex cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations may cause the death of cells or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
Examples of activities at the location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking pictures and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small cities and cars, they travel to a place of work, while those whose work destination they have just left.
In this dynamic transport scenario, all are somehow connected to a private car-based transport system and supported.
Science now states that this massive carbon economy has kicked the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
They all participate in society and use transport systems. Almost all complain about transport systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why are traffic systems caused by so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something much bigger?
The traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of the traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually act relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be mathematically displayed.
In order to better display the flow of traffic, the links between the three main characteristics have been identified: (1) the flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
The insects were the first animals to fly, their ability to fly allowed them to escape from their enemies and find more efficient food and steam.
Most insects have that advantage that they can bend their wings back along the body.
This allows more small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend the wings of a dragonfly and a water flower.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarh said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (even the other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second largest and longest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, about six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water pouring out of the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 km long (3.980 miles). It is poured by water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids were built until the Old Kingdom fell apart, none of them exceeded the size and technical excellence of the pyramids in Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, who were more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language that serves most of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People of old have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and dill because all can be found in nature in the original form and is relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made of one or a mixture of more than four elements. It's land, water, air and fire.
It was more like four aggregate conditions (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also theorized that they were changing into new substances to form what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into a point at the end of this sentence.
So the pen became a close friend to a large number of people when she showed up.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of a newer way of writing the pen has lost its status and is increasingly used.
People are writing messages on computer screens today, so they don't need a sharpener.
We can only assume what happens to the keyboard when something new comes up.
The physical bomb acts on the principle of taking energy to assemble the core with a number of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up the hill.
Some atoms have unstable nucleus, which means they tend to fall apart when they push slightly or without pushing.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the bark is about 70 km from the nearest side and 100 km from the other side.
Tanji is in the area of the moon's sea, and thicker in the area of the plateau.
There could be more dark areas on the near side because it's a crust.
Content theories are focused on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires that are interalized with maturing and growing up.
These theories consider what some people are encouraged to want what they want and who appear in the environment to encourage them to do something or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of need and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can come out in case the leaders start managing former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain part of the team."
This type of manager is experiencing difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, carrying out evaluations, granting competences and calling people to responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything that the team has done so far and do it his way.
The team leader is ultimately the one responsible for his success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should comply with the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are little differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent a touch point to the nearest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than the classic team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local administration may not understand.
"The presence of a real" "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, 109th page) is also a unique component of the virtual team. "
The "invisible team" is a team of leadership that suits each of the members. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would the organisation go through a long-term process of establishing a learning organisation again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After the effective use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to an expression.
As a result, the process of an organization that is trying to overcome the barrier through cooperation can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before the organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method that allows organisations to achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data is physical evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge research, which makes the area of research more narrow and more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior confirms research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors have affected behavior and caused changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore unprecedented brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong scientific and fantastic connotation, it makes a very important branch of information science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adjustment of the machine.
A study of artificial intelligence includes making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and drafting of a schedule, the ability to respond to the diagnosis and questions of customers and the recognition of manuscripts, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in economics, medicine, construction and military because it is built into some software applications for home use and video games.
Excursions are a significant part of each class. Often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions. Students can look at exhibits in the museum, visit the aquarium or admire the beautiful art as they sit in class.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also an excellent way to think about the road and share experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the federal state, every year the page changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve the student's writing skills. When they start to run a blog, students often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the audience's presence in most cases corrects it.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer is beginning to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Writing the blog also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them." The need to encourage the audience's interest inspires them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages co-operation and encourages students to pass on learning outside the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs" can encourage students to take into account analytical and critical thinking; by active response to online materials, students can define their position in the context of other people's writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002). "
Ottawa is a charming capital of Canada and offers a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
A little further south is the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to untouched natural beauty in the Muska region and beyond.
Because of all these things, the Ontario party sees it as essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are very rarely inhabited, and some are almost ruled by an uninhabited wilderness.
To compare the population that surprises many: more African-Americans live in the United States than citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to the plant and animal world.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or have ties to France and are well known luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, which has put deep roots on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese researcher Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime path from Europe to India.
The area is surrounded by Sahel in the north, or the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women on the journey say that they are married regardless of their actual marriage status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Refuse men decisively and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (it is not right regardless of the cultural differences!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by barbarian fishermen in the 10th century BC, and at the time of the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenida the city was known as the strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, called Casa Branca, to leave it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt a town called Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was found by Spanish traders who founded the trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping places in Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as seals, pots, leather goods, mules and a whole series of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gom was destroyed by a lion from the Nyaragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the nature of the fight that takes place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a starting point for the rise to the Nyragongo volcano and some of the cheapest options of trekking with mountain gorillas in Africa.
For a tour of Gome you can use points-points (motto taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congoan francs for a short ride.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, we use Timbuktu today as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although his reputation makes him a tourist attraction and owns the airport, Timbuktu is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the PBS shooting, Wonder of the African World.
The city is the exact opposite of other cities in the country because it has more applications of the Arab world than the African world.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and stretches the border with Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.

It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in other South Africa national parks, daily fees for nature and tickets should be paid.
It could also be useful for someone to buy a wild card that allows them to enter certain parks in South Africa or all South Africa national parks.
The Hong Kong territory was named after the island of Hong Kong, which is the main centre for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the Hong Kong panorama is comparable to the glittering stage chart, which is even more visible thanks to the sea in the port of Victoria.
For the best review of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban development of the Hong Kong island is densely crammed on a land that has been landed along the north coast.
This place was adopted by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of a colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal band of mangroves in the world, and it stretches 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans was declared UNESCO's world heritage, a part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangroves, including some of the last places of powerful jungs that once covered the Ganges Valley.
Sundarbans is an area of 3.850 km ², of which about one third is covered in water-wetland areas.
Sundarbans has been a haven of wild animals since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the long-distance bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those moving east and in Jakar / Bumthang, go between 6: 30 and 7: 30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most counties, small Japanese buses are made by Toyota Coaster, which are pleasant and firm.
The sharing of the taxi is a fast and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as the cities of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The bridge across the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in France.

The height of the free passage under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was open for traffic in March 2017.
The launch of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarans were the most important indigenous community inhabited in today's eastern Paraguay. They were half-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-supply agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other native tribes, such as Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who lived on hunting, collecting fruits and fishing.
After meeting the Spanish invaders with the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great province of India," was created.
The Spanish started a three-century colonization period.
Paraguay has been able to maintain its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.

The official Falkland currency is a Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are mostly accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, they probably don't accept credit cards, but they may accept British and American currency; ask the owner in advance to inform you of an acceptable way of paying.
It is almost impossible to replace the Falkland currency outside the islands, so replace the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, there is a summer there when the northern hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical belt; in the summer, temperatures of + 30 ° C. are common in the summer months.
