I don't drink alcohol.
There seems to be no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom's circling it.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did he tell Tom why he wants to go to Boston?

I am totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America with a convertible.

These monks live inside the monastery.
All I have to do is find him.
Can I see this?
He can speak in Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is pleased with his success.
You're trustworthy.
I didn't even consider it.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree 100%.
These flowers as well as being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's as interesting as it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do it?

It will remain our secret.
It will happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try to fix it?
We've made far too many mistakes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.

What's the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.

What do you think of the new professor?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen stronger than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom's just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.

What time does it leave here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like black and strong coffee.
He says nobody cares about something like that.

Start.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds familiar.
Do you have any chalk?
I'm bringing Tom some food.
I'd like to see some dancing.

Don't you want to eat?

We don't drink.
I came back from school, then I went out with my friends.
I arrived at the station this morning.
Does that make me look fat?
Everything's getting cheap.

You're suffering from osteoporosis.
You can tell her I said that.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
Look at this beautiful moon!

I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll be home safe.

I can't run a company, it's too hard for me.
Are you learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't eat bananas often.
Get them out of here.

Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I think I've had too much to drink.

That would have been terrible.
We have to do our best to change things.

It is not the length of life, but its depth.

Take the table outside, please.
This is good stuff.
I did what I was asked to do.

Should I give this to Tom?
Do you have any friends?
He helped him.
You're really annoying.
The rest is history.

I won't bother you anymore.
This box contains apples.
Tom can do that for us?
If you have time, let's go shopping.
Is he home now?
I thought I was going with her.
Hey, guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
I can't trust you.
Tom seems agitated.
Which course do you recommend?
The long journey made his injury worse.
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
She did what she was told.
Tom gave Mary a banana.
Is that legal?

We had a really good time.
We should let her rest.
Nothing lasts forever.
I know you don't know them.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom's not Canadian.
I want to be safe.
It starts tomorrow.
Can you speak in Esperanto?
I'll see her again next Friday.

Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You need to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like him.
Are you coming in?

You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very funny at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I really don't want to talk.
So it must be Argentinean.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken up.
He should have done it yesterday.

Keep your tongue at bay.

I appreciate your comment.
I'm sure she'll show up soon.
Can you keep a secret?

He wore a mask so no one would recognize him.
Tom told us why.
Nothing Tom said was true.
You should have stayed with her.
I haven't received any warning that you're on your way.

Are you listening to music?
She screamed from terror.
Don't let Tom in.
Let the holidays begin!
You don't know anything about me.
It's mean.
Who are the others?

I want to give up.
I spent my holidays in Tunisia.
Why did you buy a car like this?
She killed herself yesterday.
How long are you staying?

They were suffering because of the smog.
He underestimated them.
We have the same problems as you.

I was angry and confused.
Who hurt you?
The boy started screaming.
We all laughed at her pink evening dress.
You don't talk to me about religion!
How did you spend your vacation?
They're not that nice, are they?
What else did he tell you?
I thought you were mad at me.
I came up with a good idea.
I think it's really ugly.
He's so aggressive, others avoid him.
He has a sense of humor.
Which club do you belong to?
I'd like them all to go home.
Go back to work.
They won't find her.
I admire Tom's dedication.
We've been on it three times already.
There's not even an orange on the table.
Are you still jealous?
She followed me into the kitchen and took a knife and then started cutting vegetables.
He suffered a fair amount of trauma.
Tom left something on the table for you.
I've never been to my uncle's house.
I love Alex Marcelo.
It was nice chatting with you.
I should just tell Tom the truth.
Where were you in 1979?
Tom decided to risk everything for love.
We heard him go down the stairs.
I'm better.
We haven't seen much of Tom since his divorce.
We ignored Tom.
You can't compete with them.
When did you ask them?
I don't want to be bald when I'm still young.
We weren't lucky.

You must know him.
Laura, are you a teacher?
It belonged to them.
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?
How long was he gone?
How do you expect me to eat?
I'm surprised Tom can't speak French.
He was playing the piano.
I can take her home.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I think they were wrong.
The supreme treasure is knowledge, the central treasure is children and the lowest treasure is material wealth.
That would be risky.
We got up at 4: 00 in the morning.
I have one.
We're shy.
I know your mom doesn't want you to talk to me.
