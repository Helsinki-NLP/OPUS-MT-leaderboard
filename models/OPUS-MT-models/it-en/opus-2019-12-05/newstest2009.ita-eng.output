The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed since the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stock on Wall Street.
So, also from us, it shows a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Destruction of actions in Asia
On Tuesday the shares of the Asian Stock Exchange experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day subsequently cancelled some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index cancelled almost 4% during the day, but then also some of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, decreased by 3.8% while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world," said Hong Kong Currency Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, is managing its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer from the consequences.
The massacre of American actions
On Monday, the American Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which 700 billion dollars had to be allocated (almost 12 billion Czech kroner).
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday have experienced a massacre and the main indices of the actions have recorded the greatest collapse for over twenty years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar collapse was observed last time in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has surrendered: the US government can give 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the US financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told the Reuters agency, the chairman of the Barney Frank Chamber's Committee on Banking and Financial Services.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the approval of the financial plan will take place should be the first and fundamental psychological factor able to awaken the financial markets.
But then there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, the help of the markets can be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which bring financial companies to severe losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the end of the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
The Sign for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday's market following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount envisaged for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it feels that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overpower its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has been maintained, that is to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We worked it out.
The chamber of representatives should be able to vote on Sunday law and the Senate Monday, "as the Republican Senator mentioned.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive trend of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate's banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a big step towards the deal that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is about helping house owners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage payments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly payments expenses for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the principal economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is because we do not know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial for how the losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz site.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that already this week the representatives of the Congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time, "said Marek.
Last-minute duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should be able to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason for this.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream about a turntable like this.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't do cell phones by mistake.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, telephone and text, he can read music and video, record both and he has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe he can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds, you'll also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle since no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and before the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as cheap phones are concerned, you don't count on them to last for more than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, some calls, get work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst will last a minimum of 9 hours with continuous functionality with a refill.
Another problem is when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to make it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the performers, name of the album, genre or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs, and clearly ease of use.
If the music is mainly for the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need an ordinary MP3 phone.
This happens now, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats your mobile phone or reader recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be right in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
It is located less than the AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipod companies).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is usually limited only to hits of radio time.
The prices aren't exactly low.
But it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little something goes through their pocket while the MP3 player is left at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than 3,000 kronor.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and even with 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
The advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or even the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start-up of the mobile internet network and consequently of a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you return to the 2 000 kronor.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iliver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, please take the specialist mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it gets closer to the same MP3 player.
In this context, Sony Ericsson has made more progress, which walkman cell phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above mentioned brands ensure the same service and price category up to 4 000 kronor, but with a larger storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as of this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
There is something missing here - a virtual operator who forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, it was also confirmed by Mr Čti, who pointed out that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS messages will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high for Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds crazy, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly over 100%.
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecoms Council (ČTře), Pavel Dvořák, who has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic, also often stresses.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network no longer probably has many possibilities. (Moreover, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that led to a significant fall in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, there were similar voices in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, for example, we must not go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual mobile operator in Poland.
In only half a year this operator managed to conceive more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking lies the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other things U: fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to operate effectively, that is to say, it is sufficient to have many fewer customers than to a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS messages that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a target group not a little.
This operator points specifically to men, so to speak.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we too can affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
Press spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubted: "The Czech market is relatively small due to a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of the services is relatively saturated. "
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not be.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have much expectations.
Mobilking will be switched on rather in the other countries of our area, "he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman of the Penta financial group.
Thus, it indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thinking.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor can be created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, GTS Novera, who would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them, "says Pavel Kaidl Group spokesperson.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence stands around its creation.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us, "he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršei of the Telefònika O2 press section.
Other operators also rely on the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesperson for T-Mobil Martina Kemrová added in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial commercial project, on which it is possible to continue to build."
He adds: "A virtual operator will hardly appear in the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this moment we already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon. "
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on reaching its 3G licence requests.
Miroslav Čepický added: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet. "
The competent authorities - with the accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation U: fon testify that when operators care about something they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing on ČTři during the period of creation of U: fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTři's web pages.
But now just U: fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has been underdeveloped with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that the entrance of another competitor would place on him and above all on his high demands services. "
However, the attitude of the mobile operators is surprising because of the total lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulators.
This is not just about the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately has no competence to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had materialised.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators, "said Kristián Chalupa, of the External Relations Section ÚOHS, in reply to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
On the other hand, on the part of the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and also deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not, of course, belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
The almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions is truly striking throughout the situation.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is on its own.
Similarly, the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecoms regulator, "said Mr Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTřís, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the network operator's agreement is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has - logically at the end of the day - the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a bit alerting for ÚOHS that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTři in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTři's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently passed telecoms law was updated, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks.
While without us noticing, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that publish their price lists of mobile phone services but are only partially public.
Usually they are companies dealing with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the predetermined persons.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If the cases mentioned, of which we are going to intervene, were presented, this could be a breach of contractual conditions and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, this can be done by thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
In other words, they derive a considerable profit from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot dispose in full of it as the usual customers of mobile operators. "
But this should be a bit odd at the ČTří.
In addition, another issue for ÚOHS opens up.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant fall in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in the developed countries, in these very cases, regulatory bodies have intervened in defence not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both formal measures and non-formal pressure have led to the creation of the first virtual operator and others have joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves from one to the other the whole case like a hot potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes it more than convenient.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will start again.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it would be difficult for ÚOHS to remain unaffected by the refusal (discrimination) of the other parties concerned.
And we might stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj."
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - solo with male or female voice, chorus pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the review of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already earlier he said on the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing variants to solo, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have a clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year's 175-year anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He gained popularity and people spontaneously made him his own.
The first verse of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time even with an electronic card
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the metro, tramway and bus will pick up the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pocket.
Right now, they can get about 100,000 people who own their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days and annual (which will be valid from the first January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged in the Infopoint and in the offices of the Company of Transportation and at the metro stop Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letřany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be bought from yesterday on the internet to the page of the Company of Transports www.dppp.cz.
The service took advantage of more than 400 customers before the afternoon.
Those who start using the service via the internet can completely forget the counters in the metro stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The coupon is bought via the internet and on the Opencard they reload it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have at their disposal a desk with trained staff that will help interested parties in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the acquired credit." said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and selfservices that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resembling the ticket changers and the passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro.
"Now there are five of them all over the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," concluded Opatrný.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will run from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will load on.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transport of Prague there are the controllers equipped with readers of the cards with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the mode of control of the tickets Filip from the organization Ropid, that it finalizes the times of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver's box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," added Drápal.
Passengers who take city buses and do not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATM, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the apparatus will be displayed here.
The Germans of the Sudetans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the Sudetans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, certain groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also the result of the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov asked in their letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Šumava district" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia again.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units arrive at German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter signed with the words "People who care about the destiny of Šumava with all their heart."
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Germans of the Sudeten hope only to brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to assume the protect on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," is written in the letter.
The reason the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the command of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to understand that it was going to be their move from the republic, only a few of them admitted that this was a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans visited him for him to teach him Czech.
"These people believed that once they got home the Czech would be useful to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia pima of the war, according to him counted on the fact that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš's office is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
You should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
Above all, he wants to touch young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What's it gonna look like in the commercials?
Especially stories about people who will affect emotions.
This is also borne out by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capital on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The commercials will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can commonly see images with drastic scenes of victims of accidents.
This promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
One must remember the risk to drivers, "says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce hospital.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will not pay any more attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, expressed his support for the return of virtually all the occupied territories in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
This is what he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) areas, if not all, will have to be returned," Olmert told the daily newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the bulldozers or levellers to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he said.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Mr Olmert also spoke about the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of Golan, that is, in his opinion, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up in order to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their permanent support to the terrorism of Hamas, the Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that makes long distance routes
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the coach of the company Student Agency came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week's incident with which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at that moment next to the driver on the less secure spot of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus has standing seats according to the registration.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing, confirmed at Aktuálnř.cz the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat, "he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no law deals with the regularisation of this role."
However, no regulation prevents the haulier from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined, "adds spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law addresses this problem quite well.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing spaces.
Everything here, "he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing seats and the maximum speed limited, interurban with standing seats with a higher but longer speed without standing seats with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the steward movement on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even there it's not safe when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bang his head.
"If the bus makes a sudden brake, obviously the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must resolve the safety of the stewards by means of an internal regulation, "he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services..
This one takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director doesn't think their job is dangerous.
"As soon as I feel I have to consider the steward profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers on their way up.
It would also reduce expenses, "he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostesses, we're already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident, "he said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the "accident of the line for Naples died a young hostess of the region of Plzeč, who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The coach driver tried to avoid it with an abrupt maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are unedible."
The company plans to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the Court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law review?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They did not achieve any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much buses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving, "says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard stewarts' activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesperson Havelka, who concludes that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the safety offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes are on Frankfurt
There is no lack of words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the staff of the house.
In the letter published on Monday which could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent blockade" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive force for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
As WestLB is still under severe pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervision Service, having pointed out a long time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is pressing for a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the savings banks' own customers already know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB has certainly been talking about this for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the presentation of the turnover for the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Via Mainza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, Deka's board of directors, half of whom are brought by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to hold talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in Frankfurt's business square, not mentioned the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing done about this trio.
As soon as the projects were published, Hesse's regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end, Günther Merl, president of Helaba's board of directors, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
Apart from that, it seems that knowledge is being created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could begin.
For Helaba, it's not entirely good news.
If it increases the pressure for further mergers, the partners will as soon as they are lacking.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although he has so far overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of Hesse-Thuringia savings banks, which participates with 85% of Helaba, has put the seal on the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasoning is just one thing.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are combined.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with what business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which is naturally not desired by West LB.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution."
You will see how the reunification of individual parts with Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them, next to the barrel of 5l of the Kaiser brand stands a bearded massif and shows the 200 or so travellers what deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four courier with destination Monaco, Beer Festival, "scheduled arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, it's not for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with a false fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver sticks belong to him the buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, this year it's three tours.
The night trip, during the day at the party, back at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide - Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better this way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as planned, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "We know you aggiando.it."
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!," cites Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, or else we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service that we behave!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear! "
Third: "Tonight at 22.30 on time we meet here again! Do you understand?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the way one attacks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as the Italian weekend.
Exact data do not exist, we talk about 50 thousand, that leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specially from Italy.
The police of Monaco are strengthened with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first in place with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed finance minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started at the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to protect himself from turbulence in the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate just has to pay the interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private banks and the public.
After all, it's the losses of affiliate Depfa.
The state financier, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced himself in the very short term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% from EUR 2.37 million, the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared with last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in loans have fallen more than 70% of the 5 million euro.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were disbanded into the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the traditional state funding was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the affiliate's value, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had already been reduced by 2 / 3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks largely dried up because banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs refinancing in the short term for part of Depfa's credit portfolio - about 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international money markets mostly not functioning.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke said, on the contrary, that the HRE Group will not need the money markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervision Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketing of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is hoped for the shares and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be ruled out either.
After Sunday evening the bank learned it was going to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The share rate falls by 75% over 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good at mortgage classes.
While the earlier debts are almost unmoveable, they give up the posterized credit rates.
Above all, the mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are hit understandably the deviations with expiry beyond 2009.
First, the Della HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institution itself, which, with the importance of the Depfa, has become impacted the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the least-damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, annual depreciation can be expected within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But when it comes to reversed information due to partial statistic, the near-certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains countervailing charge.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box Secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of the school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Log of exchange tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I even smelled like I was going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, and luckily, I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive slowly from 8 am onwards, until 8.40 am begins a brief conversation with the professor, the so-called "home room."
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce it well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy to have already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, chuckled and made a mark, and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet."
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me garnered, for her it was an honor to sit next to a student of exchange
The rest of the lesson time had continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and laughed and annoyed me with questions - then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Everyone on the break opened their Bento.
My host mother even made me a lunch- basket is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruits and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
Actually, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
Fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums in salt, Brrr!
Bento isn't just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to get to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said,
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn some Japanese language.
I was totally convinced I was coming once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and last trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life. "
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees when they feel danger. Does that mean they feel fear as well?
The neurologist scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
The Internet newspaper "Edge" has been publishing articles of well-known scientists for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an impractical territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same thing that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct sharing in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among the other creatures it lacks completely.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the pre-frontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus accepted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in the way of speaking of man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose great problems for us.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed regardless of their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of short primate memory, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, one first passes to the neural correlations of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
So, what is the meaning of feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we, with the help of words and grammar, can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities than the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and the paleo cefalo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless concentrated more on the paleocefalo.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict him, but I believe that this is inalienable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and humans appears to be fear, is likely to be felt with senses in both cases: but how could it occur if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in case of danger run away as if he felt fear too?
In my view, the mere similarity of behaviour cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar palaeoencefals, the cockroaches not even a brain.
But the paleoencefalo is responsible for the feelings?
And even if it could be demonstrated for humans: how would it be shown on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, as long as the same procedure is waived on rats and men.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward rather than constantly banging against a wall.
I am, in fact, a practical emotional.
The President of UEFA Platini: return to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," said Wasjunik
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries "
Both host countries are limping in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
If necessary, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we must work at maximum speed, "said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured the president of UEFA Michel Platini that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end they even had to postpone the start of the League at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid rebelled outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now he has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared adulterous his former Dennis Quaid.
He foams with rage and turns back.
War of the Roses with delayed burst for the former couple of spouses Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now quarrel with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the treachery would only come to you after the separation.
The occasion for the "striptease of the soul" was Ryan's work with the press for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was clear-cut: it would be "unheard of," said the fifty-four-year-old at the New York Daily News, who "Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reproduces the history of our relationship."
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from the separation, Quaid is married again and soon becomes the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the dart: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is all for the best. "
Prices for air tickets and hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays at the hotel have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter it observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, that it would lead to a "diminishing desire to travel of the American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the price recession of hotels in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the prices of the hotels with an increase of 26.3% hold even the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to the rise in kerosene, economic class passengers had to pay 7.1% on average compared to 2007, long-haul fuel intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell on average by 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, but in the first class and Business price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter fell by 23.6%.
As for German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices would be, on the one hand, declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV of Hamburg becomes the lead player.
At Borussia Luhukay, he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
This is Kristoffer Klein making it worse for the Marko Marin national team to land in luck.
Gladbach player first came late in the game and failed with a cross shot
His message was formulated with precision, he passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena booths.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in place again.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, with an even higher estimate than some old players.
And so his admonition also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything here today was nice to see," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "want more relaxed."
For the 1-0 Hamburg players must thank Mladen Petric's head shot (11) and the fact that the many weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The FVC in Hamburg will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can fix everything," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling, that the provisional certificate from table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late - the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric port as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern - finds that it slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol raises forcefully.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the velocity of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast-freezing fuel pipes, you now have to die from freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion - the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they gain additional momentum / thrust / oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised scholars for years: rockets do not behave completely as one would expect according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly get faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year rechristened the anomaly of Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton firmly believes as before Einstein did not make mistakes, and tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space scholars have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
A force of attraction emerges from her, whose effect on other celestial bodies is shown.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, that is to say she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially precisely any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros for ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six kidnappers turned out to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab broadcaster and Italian media have reported.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health, "said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages is still unclear: therefore, the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "said the official.
It would have been "still only a matter of taking over the hostages," when all of a sudden "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers by gunfire and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom from Germany of EUR 6 million; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jum" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to set women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to give a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested her and blindfolded her before she had sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the eighties, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, had "emotionally died," and had "given up on life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
They think she killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and blindfolded her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up before the court. "
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They must have thought this was being treated internally by the Mod and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be accused under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer should be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the account of B & B
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given £14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he thinks it's unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering market of houses are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pence a liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five pence a litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase to their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Denied bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has refused a bail claim from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
Your lawyers said that the court refused to bail you out for extorting 50 million takas ($729.700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many charges of corruption hanging against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected for the next few weeks but her party, Awami League, has requested that the military-backed country's temporary government give her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear according to the terms of your release, whether you can remain at liberty when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court refused the bail application for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on her word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall make an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expects Sheikh Hasina to return home after October 17, said Sunday a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban who would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to oblige the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV TV station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that the participation of BSkyB hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's shareholding in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, leading to the launch of an investigation by the Competition Commission.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB arranged that forcing it to reduce its ITV stand was unattainable and a disproportionate reminder - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or cleared," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been assessed more cheaply than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution against Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in a fire storm, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officials from the Department of Justice resigned.
(The general inspector's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in dismissal, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained on the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
He emerged later that he had a cyst on a vocal rope.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenue, boulevard, streets and other sleepers, some famous, others purely of use.
But even many veteran and long-term resident taxists find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from First Street - without making Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There's no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say that they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remains of the elegant neighborhood of the past.
But the city's preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the district municipal commission, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the district of the Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left at the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Housing Preservation, said that in fact it was the desire of the city to sell the street and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover photo set for the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village "gentrification," opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the piece of public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity - a fragment of almost nothing changed city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A somewhat nostalgic look at the dying city"), published part of a Discourse on the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even during the day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with saracinesque, with weeks old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran smoothly through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lies next to a bunch of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
On this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school."
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in class of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among fourth graders, a surprising 100 percent of students did the higher level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-graders did the expert level test on English-speaking-art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses."
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not be able to identify which one it was."
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools with Hispanic majority and English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but educational policy in its own party (National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument banal when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The oil futures fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York mercantile exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial upheaval, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had collapsed to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the background of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after congress leaders had said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachavia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the hectic negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement "seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Banking analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by around 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, Defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday unfold, when the Jets turned a no-points game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equalled the greyness of the threatening clouds over them with a weak game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages arrived at Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think. "
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense heavily hit Cardinal Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray launch and raised it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith scheduled another ride and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens drives a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession of ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20 yard goal for a 34-to-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe its madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked much more the second quarter than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time. "
Retired Gebrselassie overcomes his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the favorably flat race in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous 2: 03: 26 score for 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie developed the 26th world record of a career so stunning that it produced a world championship or a world record at any distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half a cross-country like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone to long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well. "
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having overorchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the best Marathonet stars in the world, counting on the opener as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticism rarely diminishes the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathonet.
With the cadence of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite Kenyan racers, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the breakers vanished.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final jump to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2: 07: 48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2: 19: 19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2: 21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2: 25: 01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the large theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and that makes tourists stop understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
He is as independent, dignified and private as he was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the southern black - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Rout 17, a road running through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama
As low as a drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking that he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston came into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were grinning.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, swinging on his chair on the patio on the back above the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a gravestone grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in her story.
Forced integration, besides other things, had ended its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car. "
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardises the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You weren't hugging your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who surpassed prejudices, as he did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just don't understand. "
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey through Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's acclaimed Hurston biography hit bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had passed the lights of the limelight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its project on the street.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what is supposed to be high speed, a true pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the imagination that the city has of itself.
Those from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the historical public register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
It's 90% black today.
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just came in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a pretty city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and the huge Times Square TV screens, they wouldn't know they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycomb over their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
The delivery men shake metal carts for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for meetings at breakfast.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretch shirts hung from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4: 00 and 7: 00 on a working day.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned this so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP subsidiary Morgan Chase, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order check books, tourists ask directions for the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "banker of trust," were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places they commute, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrits (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers as family members.
In past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been subject to controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachavia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The clerks and clerks standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe harbor, the bank that's asking for more securities on Wall Street.
New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become financial experts.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform porter, almost 50-year-old from my condo, has changed the subject to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances. "
Muslim Tombs desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry signals like road signs representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits spray Jewish symbols like David's Star over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is connected in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a spiritual research journey following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the votes, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was predominantly brought by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad banned from Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after they had provided the magistrates with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's court in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25th at the Ashford stand, the Kent police have filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the sex offender register.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to discuss individual cases or possible movements of Glitter to the country.
A Kent police spokesman said, "Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have adequate comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to embark on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not pass him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Precura, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to enter him in the register of convicted sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no rugs, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatre of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less well-known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing, "explains the artist and clarifies that in" Flamenco-People "may also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists, performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage... and to capture the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are interior.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco. "
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas," Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving to the modern photo, according to an idea that reflects the conception of the flamenco proper to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists portrayed.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("Sportartproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, knowing them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the hardest kind in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice. "
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at 20 Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places that still do not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
He has always favoured the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our Mutual Friend," filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience whose time had passed when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how his literary vocation was born, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined way" to substitute for the "lack of inspiration," with an intense work of documentation, editorial and continuous makeover; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist recognised that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a fleeting experience," said Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of bullfighting that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for bullfighting had verified that the conditions of the ground of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has gone up against this festival, preventing two days out of three from celebrating.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bulls from taking place.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista were on the billboard, who were to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held on a regular basis only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having torreato with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the Los Llanos arena without glory and without punishment.
With the second bull, after a terrible mule, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the roadblock in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers tell the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they're on the run.
Officers have ordered the halt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping on the run.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after pursuing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to the communiqué from the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when road officials from Alava were carrying out a transport check on N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, rushed abruptly and crossed the checkpoint.
The officers pursued themselves until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
Ertzaintza agents were able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pellets, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since the officials found that the freshman had been "duplicated" as it did not coincide with the one reported in the van documentation, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to what was revealed to People magazine by a spokesperson from California.
The witness specified that around 16.30 Locklear "crushed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth. By reversing, it passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first glance, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," which is why the officers led her to a specialist drug and alcohol centre to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol overload hypothesis was discarded from the outset, although "according to the officers at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some kind of drug."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI Federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be the responsibility of the regional training federation to take a decision on the case of the former Councillor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the allegation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been the Councillor on the Council of Seville to date.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public posts."
"Sangre de mayo," Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci represents in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood," and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Madrid Community three years before he made a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 medrilegno. The director had accepted provided that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million total budget allocated by the Madrid Community represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the appropriate scenographies and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that failed the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII," said Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive the same funding as those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set design that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his practice of usual work, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
He was nominated for the Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "which should be known."
Garci doesn't expect any prizes from this movie.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you conform to just spinning one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays homage to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer in the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to have worked with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible."
The ballerina argues: "We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested to me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tangans.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic, "he explains.
The performance includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of her performances, as face in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about it. "
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song by Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussion by El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompaniment of these artists who have been all-round divers, and who have always had many spasimanti."
In the work there is also present in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers and much less considers her work as something of value," Bayon argues.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
The publication of the "Diario de un poetà recién casado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Councillor for Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the reedition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz," which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York at the same time as the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillor for Culture of the Andalusia Council acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado," edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
And yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very tough blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could be better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new reasons to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and people remain well to be admired, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and lost causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn died of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country that cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for rectitude and to have a serious and distant private life on the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some people are trying and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once, but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not miss the opportunities not to be.
"Why do I go out to eat burgers today if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as a devoted husband, loving father, prompt grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've seen.
A lot of nonsense, that if they were subsequently taken into consideration when the evaluation was being carried out and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that it would go sooner.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, that's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had T-shirts only of size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, that kind of thing is trivial compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we hadn't even deposited the backpack yet, although once we were successful in the business, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even turn out in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it won't fit into my thoughts.
So I think we're gonna keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a preview of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of carrying out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in groups of conversation.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks you if you are there to visit someone and tells you that you will be at your disposal shortly.
All without blue shenanigans.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - hey! Steve, it will be for "the least."
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added functionality and "extra" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You take your computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They're desperate for it, in fact, and I bring back a little example here.
I took the picture in this post at one of Microsoft's employee recreation rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign urges you to use your own search tool - "Your research. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the network.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's' Diamante de sangre ', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's' The Godfather 'as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscular parish.
And if we try to enumerate the stars' appearances, we can recall the image of the forcible with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is there 'tank', as the English call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks."
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marinara T-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they're more than pretty girls and celebrities who lend their names.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of her new home, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, he conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinemas of the '50s and' 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and see how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything comes together and there are many things in common.
I, as a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to search my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when they hand you the wardrobe, it's when you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a little girl, and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're gonna be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me to and I also want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for some films to come out in different cinemas shot last year.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be like this.
I want "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago, you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to go to London to attend a charity parade for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we exhibited - I brought two pieces of our Mango collection - were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
So many things are being said about her, that I know her from a long time, I can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't back out.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcoholic"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol levels install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a drunken state or if they do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Sicurezza dell'Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once per DUI then returned to driving the car.
Alcohol would avoid this, because it is a vehicle-related system that measures the alcohol rate in the expired air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanction.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices allow for a reduction of up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it's estimated that it could save 115 people's lives a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviour before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, without doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without peep-toes.
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second programme, the Spanish plane in which the principles of Asturias travelled landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to use as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... are you from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, is very familiar with the principles of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 Navy soldiers who offer the salute of honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," maybe they told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best award offered by fashion
Probably there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and Valentino's bont vivan.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a €300,000 prize.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in Mango's window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, together with the desire for pleasure to the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's finest canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken and doing of necessity virtue, because of the recent death of his brother, wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a big guy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the complimentary dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as a knight which he ended, along with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirt - drawn by her hand - turned for dinner, wearing a long sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie."
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us first photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez - another big guy who moves on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and making sure before, that there were no odours in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, c'est la vie.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 am, but it is even worse to imagine oneself involved in the hectic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer has a back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to get out of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" denies this conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak while falling asleep.
The first time that happens, at most you take a scare, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It appears with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in a lifetime, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in the month...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nocturnal fears, night enuresis (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above it may be associated with very high fever stages, stress or over-recitation situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, when coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that raise fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is hard to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepers appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping, so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child arises.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interview him for information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming of to say it, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Don't ever tell the kid you could ask him questions overnight to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally rediscovered the road to victory at home after a long fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellow have created the greatest number of networking opportunities, turning one into the game's victory.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who grazed the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to win and one after the other caused the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain peak and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first net for Illhaeusern, well placed, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhaeusern gunman will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his team-mates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of Illhaeusern, just turned back to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of play when, after a ruckus action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets angered fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
In front of the demonstration of the fishermen who have brutally prevented the access to various Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic has decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come forward with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee," created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel oil, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elisha David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the possible solutions to help the enterprises to regain competitiveness and to make sure the working conditions and the remuneration of the sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
Also the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but the connections with Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, starting from dawn, as demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained at the pier, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the famous refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" et "they are not going to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturing company has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession affecting the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world-wide company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the loan of 85 billion dollars, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, it specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to divest include the Air Lease Financial Corp. leasing branch, its shareholding of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on such divestments, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting History
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives turned against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, that is a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10.365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) greater than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199,61 points closing at 1,983,73 and the expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing at 1,106,55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street has sunk after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It is a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this points to how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed - Federal Reserve - (the US central bank, ndr) and the other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the finance and economy sector at Global Insight.
And pointing out the state of emergency again, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, the authorities arranged for Wachavia's rival Citygroup to purchase its banking activities.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only faced with an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial's analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury Bonds yield fell to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year bond is 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama ahead of the first television duel
After Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general quarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign have proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the drop in the polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat got the better of him.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them considered Obama to be the winner, while 25% pointed to McCain.
An excellent performance from his list partner Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"Undervaluing it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition, "he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naivety" of the opponent with regard to the arguments faced during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and expertise to be president," he assured.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without diluting, he proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness for the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he repressed, this weekend, a democratic commercial, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis favours Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition with that demonstrated by Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
While reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the sigh of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dodged the questions focused on the $700 billion (€470 billion) rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislators.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closing of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislators.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some people confess that they have not even voted: "What for? They will do what they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression in front of foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote," lamented Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change of face," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former presidential opposition candidate and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case the executive.
If opposition Members come to Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals. "
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game since "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.. "
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe which followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation rates seemed too high, and that the generalisation of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) gave rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Social-Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, asks in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient in power. "
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, since the Héma-Québec has become one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years 1980 to 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Canadian Government conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee to design a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still had faith in the system of donations in Québec, Dr Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research in the following years, we have regained public confidence, "he explains before saying proud that at the beginning of 2008, around 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Héma-Quebec.
However, Dr Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, the Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, many cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe, telling the president of the disease since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we had absolutely no idea if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports was that when doubts arise and a serious illness could arise, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself as degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, should be excluded.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years now, it has been shown that this disease is without doubt transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle. "
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allow direct recognition of the presence of the virus and not of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TAN have reduced the window period, that is from the moment the person contracted the disease to the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to detect them has therefore decreased considerably.
These improvements have considerably reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion occurs.
I believe that today we can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health, says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikunga virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr Décary before pointing out that apart from having secure resources, the Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"Needs increase as the population gets older.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors that on average make up only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors. "
However, all healthy persons who are 18 years of age and meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where it is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
There are very rare cases of shortage.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays, life is so hectic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood, "Francine Décary says desolate.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, the Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, ocular globus heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Héma-Québec which manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds rich blood of stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cordon blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says Dr Décary, who describes this practice of cordon blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because the Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals of Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-final of the A-series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90 '.
After a first time without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first round of the return game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed during the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
The only network signed Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable. "
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation. "
Charente points to the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean-Charente went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to get elected in the partial elections today.
"Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is Jean Charente's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Image Mill."
On three large screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mineral crops, pictures of Quebec seen with "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Big vehicles like in the middle of an election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area," which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential," but did not comment on timing or investment units, just as he did not explain what the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects would be.
At most, it has limited itself to pointing out what it considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list drawn up by Charente, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds."
That "territory twice as big as France," it's here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us, "he insisted, as if to urge a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of the Labrador that the Quebec has always claimed, has specified the Prime Minister in the course of the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government, "he said.
Moreover, "considering climate change, we must reassess the North," he said, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty. "
And the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this and that the project would be in their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of the Hungarian FP), have already launched the consultation of some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important post, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also comply with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, ordered and environment-friendly," he promised.
Jean Charente described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals before us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage nationalizing hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to shape the future," said Jean Charente.
During the press conference, he used another conservative reference to John Diefenbaker's "Road to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project related to the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charente specified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, arousing heartfelt applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not reject the possibility of opening a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very committed, especially in a federal council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend General Council provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the Northern Plan has been received skeptically.
The leader of the FP, Pauline Marois, dusted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have progressed today," commented Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (today's ballot), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we hope is that this will not just be perceived as a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacement of Mario Dumont, returning today from the holidays.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (irony of fate) of Harper Cabinet, who allowed himself to state last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government which is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the facts imputed to him occurred.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We would remind you, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadeffield so that he can be subject to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it matters little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," a word Harper continues to flaunt and which sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we come to the moment when there is no longer any moral: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now minority (to see what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is exactly where the shame lies, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest advertising company has filed a six million defamation claim against three authors and a small, squatted publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a complaint for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to stand up against his position.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Canada Black will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal-armed struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that will gag the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to give a fresh ruling on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that it should have presented its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions are usually held in Canada with the exchange of views and not with batons.
It would therefore have been sufficient for society to open its books, documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite obvious?
In the world of vice-president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to lawyers who are well paid and not to all the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public supporting the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of gag (looking for the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum, urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the lawsuit brought out of Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss inconvenient matters for the richest companies in the world, with multiple complaints, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.

For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to her claims, she does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the case in the public debate itself in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive claims.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan, which aims to put a brake on the financial crisis that has been hanging over Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides, in particular, for checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed houses for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of remuneration paid to managers of protected undertakings.
American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, priceless disappointments and upheavals would have poured into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit allowed was the opening of markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations later, the two candidates for the American presidential elections were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction at the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves the credit for adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to keep their home and the one concerning the remuneration for managers of state-funded companies.
"When asking taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be welcomed about.
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"According to what I read, this is something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable, "he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the dubious credits, the assets at risk and unsaleable of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (mortgages), then to other more widespread forms of debt securities (PCAA) and leading to the freezing of liquidity and the downside of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who blew up the first draft agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats agreed that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that if the government were to face losses over the next five years as a result of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will be worth the dividends in case of profit and that will be able to sell back when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the foreclosure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and starting-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit him to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both on the Republican and democratic sides.
"Evidently, Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, to his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the Skeptical Caucus," democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis in Europe.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group of €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas reported that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euro (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are gained in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are unsure "
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British Government seems to be nationalising another bank in the balance for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) were real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, on his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the long run.
Less monumental than Brando, to which he resembled and of which he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spokesman of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples, magical children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last quality mark.
Since in him was recognized a whole country full of safe made man, of the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
The same man militant for civil rights was also the automotive driver who ranked second at the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadowy areas of a private, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which one will never be able to reveal completely the mystery, leave with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the disappearance of Paul Newman was a dip in the heart of the cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation reappears through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are mixed up in The Cat on the Roof, which was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
A lot of other Paul Newman has gone down in history.
The Boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which he officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice gangster in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was hers.
Him again.
Epochs happen through his path.
The young people know him mainly for the cult movie Slap Shot- Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle ended with one last godfather role of the Irish mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
Unlike the most progressive legends of the cinema that soon abandoned the craft, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood throughout its splendor, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplay," judging his performance to be exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carrions or desperate, of which he expressed drooling and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensibility.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad.
Among the countless gifts rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old arms companion Robert Redford (who had played together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywoodian drift, is extinguished.
We will have torn his face off on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it as a choice of bad taste, though born as a gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was allocated to its Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
To be there, it was a privilege. "
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & member invoice factory?
The hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and members will be discussed shortly on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from notices of competition has been used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from notices of competition on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured at Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established inter alia during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of these then were prepared invoices to be forwarded to the notices of competition, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the City of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Mauri, who, according to our information, drew up the reports needed to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados's "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the restaurant together.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of errors of form and content.
A Badacsonytomaj guesthouse has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however 130 guests were included in the invoice.
But the fictitious invoice compilers went too far when they reported Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá were not even included.
Győző Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the Public Prosecutor's Office and showed him the invoices, he immediately understood that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT game of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the invoice was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the travel agency in Budapest of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they shocked indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt VAT.
Among other things the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the foundation Jobb Jövőért, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "broadcasters" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as carried out activity goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor, activity that was not carried out from the company founded originally for advice of investments.
Moreover for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the sports ground of Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch there, precisely for this reason the liquidator of the company, according to our information, denied having issued that invoice.
They've issued invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of nearly 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even movement of money because the prepared invoices were then turned away, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their own documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who can be connected with the accused.
For example Ivan Kubatov, authorised to direct the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, for a value of approximately 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director general of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would forward documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to us Kubatov, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant, they had not received a job.
However, the companies returned useful because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued in the name of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: to the Atlasz and the Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14,2 million florins.
The Prosecutor considers that Kubatov has cashed 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for Biztos Pont's competition notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a call for the public benefit agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order to avoid this, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the public prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the trend in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised several times to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We have to see if it is in your interest, it may also be that the socialists have reached agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million guilders, much of the damage - would be prepared to be a scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended for now, as his demands for the relief of his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrest, have not been met so far.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Licencing: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers from the University of New York managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study in Science magazine men do not want to stay behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are also willing to pay a higher price.
Research has tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to fire more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by the vehemently dodging the reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial pursuit investigation.
In this investigation, three groups fired against one partner under different conditions.
To the control group they reported what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this they promised that in the event of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of a loss at auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was underlined, while for the other the loss.
By proving neurologists' hypothesis, members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning."
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These, in fact, have so far explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to seek medical attention?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, whereas in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as the first cause of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis sufferers is one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leaks, saliva).
It is useful for travellers to vaccinate against the virus A and B, against the C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Then yellowish spots form on the skin and whites of the eyes, the faeces become clear and dark urine, healing occurs within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is estimated to be that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumours.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed people.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worth calling the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infective power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examining the way faith in God affects the feeling of pain, British Telegraph reported.
In the context of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and to as many atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part as well as academics.
The test was carried out exactly like this: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe," as if "someone took care" of them and "were calm and pervaded by peace."
Looking at the religious image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We need to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results there is only the question whether a painting of a madonna by Leonardo or another painter of such caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, this is not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see exactly the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders who was: "We put all the world's information into a system!."
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years' time Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?," but the software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their searches on the internet, exactly the words you search for are recorded, from which IP address you search and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our preferences declared and recorded previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - the concerned users of Google's data monopoly wonder.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the internauti are caused by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion in power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internauti worried about personal rights instead sighed of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the association of electronic legal protection EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even later can Google be forced with no point in the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped out almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data throw Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users who appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation," unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all these can insert them in systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear his latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
In the meantime we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, easily learns with who spent the night her treacherous boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behaviour of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with, for example, Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time leaving no tracks voluntarily).
There are not few people who don't register on purpose to community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced by alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far existing.
Public opinion does not even wait so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth of value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords / AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time cause instead large malaise not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers along with all this find some alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has totally rejected the protest of employees after having doubled the fee of company asylum, has considered it too expensive the repeated daily catering of employees, but all this belittles in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google bowed the head of the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, but one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving Google books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a given genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two underage kids helped Ózd's double murderer make his tracks disappear.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were well-founded suspects of helping to make the traces of the crime disappear - said the spokesperson of the Police Questura of the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have recognized the crime as their accused, and are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two underage, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on the loose.
The aiding and abetting is punishable for up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in preventive custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated multiple murder committed for profit.
The investigation showed that the 23-year-old boy owed a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime. One sign is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon on the scene.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell more than 60% of its securities within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner of the stock exchange and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The main owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September."
The global financial disaster was caused by the American President - accused of La Repubblica - who was unable to compel his party behind a law that was quickly engulfed, the aim of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11.
Even part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has put the world economy on the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing and the whole world will suffer from this.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of capitalism's history is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva mentions.
Some states today can still offer a rescue doughnut to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse like in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national egoism and concentrate their control on dismembered financial markets.
It is only Monday that the weakened financial institutions obtained more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, like the American ones, will have to put their hand in order to remedy the crisis, seem to be becoming more and more real.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviors" should not immediately wave the EUR 100 billion, but it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What would be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if not to mimic the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
Bees, for example.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, hornets gave the initial strategic inspiration to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying the bees form an own oval personal space that really looks much like our protective shield - it has explained to the Kazuhiro exhibition Doi, director of the field technologies PR and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetry laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance manoeuvre, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
It must react in an instinctive and immediate way because this technology corresponds to the damaging and inner layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their life is longer than those to lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
You don't need a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict to Nissan, can be installed in standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name to the very expensive child
The written version of the $700 billion saving law for the purchase of disproportionate claims, to be applied in several parts, has been drafted.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast schedule, the conference leaders decided on the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken some serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which he remained only to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, talking about the outcome of the compromise, said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic wagon.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (2 a.m. on Monday in Central Europe), but it did not bring a large stock exchange growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 draft economic stabilisation law on the programme, then the Senate will vote.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then joyfully welcomed the news of the agreement to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the Bush administration's original proposal that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury will acquire titles with disproportionate credits behind, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme in which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" claims.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance scheme where the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to find ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their exit, defined by the overseas slang simply as a golden parachute.
The limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the Ministry acquires an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute if they do not retire the decayed bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing contracts for the Golden Parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new people to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of directors-general - the Democrat Barney Frank, president of the commission responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives, has commented the provision.
In addition, the state has the right to take over a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can ultimately also gain from it if the economy, and together with it the saved bank, gets back on their feet.
The bill includes that over the next five years the president has to submit a proposal to Congress that provides for how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased by between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, mainly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared with the domestic sales of the processing industry over 12 months, the largest increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the metalworking industry, prices rose by 13.2%, by 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Ms Göncz saw the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister discussed this in Chicago with the Hungarian local representatives.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic system of entry and control."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be a permit to enter, but before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington as of today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will present the Cross medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and engage in talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two great American parties, have on Sunday guaranteed their support for the government plan of $700 billion for the rescue of the banks, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls with the focus of Obama's economic issues, it has once again recovered some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's appointment as vice-president, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that Congress would rapidly approve the $700 billion plan bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those steps of consumer protection which he also supported.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let it slip that he called McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we are all going to be difficult to bring down this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a viable way."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good releases of top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a major role in the deal, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably be voting on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self aware - thus Der Spiegel analyses the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the black-and-red coalition.
Der Spiegel (esplel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber came into office.
The Christian-socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades, and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state has ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still during the period of the aforementioned Stoiber.
This is due to the consequent modernisation of the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were very wrong about the time. However, secularization, the results of education, the establishment of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on voters' loyalty to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelance professionals, artisans, graduates and graduates.
This is where support for CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition matters" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been held, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by public television, party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Mr Faymann left the question open as to whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any event rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to the red offerings.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, it is still open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing" - Haider has declared.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as main rapporteur of the Congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Mr Járóka, according to the Press Office of the Parliamentary Group Fidesz EP, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are being excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have an average level of education and as a result of poor quality primary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Mr Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
In her view, it is necessary to make these links more aware in the wider context between the Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary in order to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be respected.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute fully to the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: piety for a transitional period
At the end of October the fate of the clumsy Huber-Beckstein couple was decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the debate on personal matters has not yet been postponed to the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not attached with all their strength to the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and of the base who, one day after the Bavarian tsunami, demanded the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gave 18% of the German GDP.
In any case, conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy always count, but in the future they will in any case be forced to join forces.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party the vice-president and federal minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, obtains a place in the restricted exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Electors Free exponents right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors comes into the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treated the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which he was up to now plotting in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU described 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the fiel towards CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be a chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is set up with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment of the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria by 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to Russian observers it is a sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the fraud committed in counting the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been out of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections held in discussed circumstances, would "grant" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a boycott previously assessed.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which requested credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines that Beltransgaz owns that country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the political situation in Belarus that is considered undemocratic.
He referred to a détente that the OSCE had stressed positive movements and not shortcomings, such as a ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not in practice appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is also prepared to engage in a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, has been considering the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition of the elections in 2006, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let even one opponent into a Parliament without weight."
The opposition does not expect any action to protest the results, but rather tries to send the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution, the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially most helped class, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime to be adequate, which considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that social security disintegration "recalls sepulchral silence" - says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, President of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure starts against the smart guys, against the timers, and then he goes for coffee at the bar on working time.
The anti-deadbeat news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the minister.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism, "Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assured: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
The word of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months absences due to illness of the civil servants have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italy, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants joined forces to contest the norms of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Function is today flying numbers about the lesser absenteeism at work due to causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'lazy workers' are constantly growing.
There are in fact thousands in Italy the employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined in order to declare war to the illegitimate norms contained in the decree. "
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatment for infirmity dependent on cause of service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which the checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures showing the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid of the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "deep appreciation of the continuing commitment of associations to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the care of victims' families and public awareness."
"Of course, an indignant 'enough', sincerely shared, has risen in the face of tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the involvement of public opinion but daily reality offers us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by the young people who face the world of work.
It is necessary to keep an eye on the phenomenon, not to deafen in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined commitment to put an end to it urgently."
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want this" downward trend "to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is loosened that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger participation on the formation of the workers, and this beginning from the world of the school. "
"It needs an ulterior effort - it has added - regarding the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion.
But, above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of the employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency. "
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection previewed for the victims of the job" and "the welfare drift towards which the system is going in the last years."
"The objective therefore is to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - it has added - because the fate of who gets injured does not have to depend on spontaneisms or bestowal from time to time ordered from the legislator."
Mp3 readers on charges, putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a press release published in Brussels mentions the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is stated in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - continues the responsible EU - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology. "
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from which they originated.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and interested parties what measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this damage by means of solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment hear high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceeding the current limits on maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of capital
Today we begin, in March we close, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital," which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the junta and the city council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there," says Alemanno. "It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to make use of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place where to prepare a great project for Rome.
In March, he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timescale.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
All too often politics squads on the management of the daily newspaper and on the emergencies that are rife from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future. "
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a wheelchair: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that expresses the Capital."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, in order to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking in a unified spirit to its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome states, "will not limit itself to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. "
The attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
He wrote a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a great nerve: he believes that he will win the highest office of a nation that he has had in all two governors and five black senators! "
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will it be a good president? Then there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Here too there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the bowels of the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things that have never been said before, which is almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Usa, the economic meltdown is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly state that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the large public wants it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newsparmen and executive seniors are convinced that the most national newspaper is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open up to the internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "does something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among those who direct the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with "occupational safety."
Executives who think they are losing their jobs within 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters you go to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it," take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always great wages, while the editor can earn even 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to pension and payment of insurance.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to arrive to 15 days total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the petition of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counteract concerning the Unipol-Bnl climb.
In the course of the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from the domiciliaries transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate owner could travel from the provincial town to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the PM has opposed it) would allow him to influence his company and to access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday's New York Times confirms this by informing us that the current crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to "Washington's" and the world of finance, strong especially in the States of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that became prepoterously alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This is, however, just an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps anticipates or already shows: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have strong links with foreign countries, but which, first and foremost, see the budgets of people and families living in one country, one state involved to a very large extent.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically world-wide but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems fundamentally out of the question or not to have much to say: the clear evidence is given by the European Union which, as usual, is divided between the different interests and between the different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all disbursement of funds: since when it comes to the straits it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back on track.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization will be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the national-state element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to deal to an increasing extent with those very little intangible things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at it, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are however absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves sovereign, certainly possess several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second innovation, but it is a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to take matters into his own hands.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discredit for existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved to be so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: a discredit, a lack of suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of countries in the West.
In other words, it seems to be becoming more and more clear, in large sections of the population, that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far in auge, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, undermines a ramified but powerful movement of delegation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "uprisings" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and last times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies today and that the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, acts potentially out of proportion.
Faced with all this talk of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters the scholars managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO - The American magazine Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones using a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "easily detaches itself from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
- "This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars presented a microfiber adhesive like hair that cleans itself from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, when taken at the same time as some life-saving medicines alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, eliminating their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice had already ended up under prosecution because it was held responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
FARMACI A RISCHIO - The Italian Medicines Agency itself had reported this in an information bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELM - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification, "stressed the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's foreign economy and policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy and that for years was refounded to the economist, but that has now turned out to be correct.
"I am surprised and also somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist," but also a publicist with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism."
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by voluntary developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with different new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less spartan interface add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some features specific to some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create documents "PDF hybrids," which collect the graphics typical of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http: / / en.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html and has been added to the English version on mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to the workplace.
And if the topic of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the spread in the houses, it is precisely in the business that Open Office the suite attempts the great bet, being already able to count on several projects realized in the public administration and in the schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, counselling and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office is made up of five main modules: Writer, for Word's video editing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint's emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to get to 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive in the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer at the Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of his positivity, confirmed Kohl's positive position to the third generation EPO.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dot jersey of best climber.
Is ITALY RAZZISTA?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning the country into a nation of racists? This is what is asked in a long article of the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "Northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation adopted by the League, which tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of the dear-rent up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students has no crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market to trigger a process of increase generalized also for the residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain a number of infringements: free, unregistered, no fee limit, linked sub-rentals.
In the case of Sunia, special measures are needed which, through the revision of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, you need about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (zone Black Bande) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fair) to a maximum of 900 (zone Victoria).
In Florence a bed costs an average 350 / 400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250 / 280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples it takes 300 / 450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a bed needs 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to students outside the Community is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25 / 30% of the fee applied to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities erase the historical halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the great multisales and the consequent death by consunction of the monosal in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear ineluctable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
They are often places of history and memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions," says the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar Award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional films have been closed, and above all the main cities pay the highest price: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost single-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but we should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for exhibitors: the state's past debt is around EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year. "
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, has decided to run to the shelter with the signature of a protocol between Municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, in order to protect and promote the monosal cinemas both in the historical center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules envisaged are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking rates and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counteract the extravagance of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New cinema Paradiso," to which I have been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn on the other side. "
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the Commune with the interests of the Cosca Piromalli."
The accusations that the magistrates of Calabria's Anti-Mafia Directorate are making to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piroballi, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, namesake of the boss, already condemned for association for criminals of mafia type, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromalli.
"In this way the Cosca - the judges write - would have been allowed to enter officially in the municipalities, facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and of address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organised underworld there are several" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean. "
This morning's arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they beheaded the Piroballi Cossack.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and again because of alleged constraints between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected as head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having orchestrated the whole for a political matter, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Cosca Piroballi had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a wider group notoriously close to the Pyroballi, unifying the choices of the public administration to the interests of the Cosca."
When the energy comes from the waves now the big ones come down into the field
It is an exterminated field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface, and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they are trying to get their hands on, giant like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for 100 years and in the 70's, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea wave exploitation plants.
This amount would be twice as much as that currently produced by nuclear power stations.
Plus there would be currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years later, betting on marine energy is becoming more and more and among these companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on the oceanic energy - the spokesman of a company associated to the American oil giant to the economic daily Wall Street Journal has declared - and is considering the possibility to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is not a small signal, especially considering that the US is still extracting oil in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to the Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate according to the observers an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about technology still in its infancy, not least because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese plant or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
However, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used to produce large-scale energy.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
The electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type being designed, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and parking space using six underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides turns the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of tides at the moment.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that overlook the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
