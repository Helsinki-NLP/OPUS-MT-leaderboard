The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: total 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first interim results, to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously stagnating, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the social-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but loses 5.5%.
Even worse, ÖVP lost almost 9% of the votes to 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the post-war period, and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, who caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in their preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them because they sunk the government.
Already in the initial reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that this could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% of votes - but the socio-democrats revealed at the same time the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated itself from the BZÖ) which was even a reason for sanctions by the Euopean Union.
On this evolution, Haider clearly plays, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to join Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations would occur.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after his meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee today.
"If it is not resolved, then yes, there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting which took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a "higher instance.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same views during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain the pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support," the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down to India for many years.
The Indians also admit it, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly regard the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists as a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he got a promise from the Indian side to deal with it.
"I have achieved relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and the adjacent marine areas.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN workers for ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer, Director of Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposition and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that have not been known to date, carrying within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they use the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is above all the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, this has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In short, a continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles, "explains Mikulka.
The request for the country to submit to the Committee on the Size of the Continental Platform must be accompanied by very extensive technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful, "adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a worldwide echo.
But also New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the area of the "bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by that international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
He shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, it acquired the status of a so-called "pioneering investor," as well as investors from a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it's almost an underwater replica of Tatry.
"E" can be extracted on the total surface area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division Rober Sandev brings with him a exhibit to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages - the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
German special units were involved in the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the military specialists, GSG9 units were present on site, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the government spokesman said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudano and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the liberates have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said, that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin when they were going back to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and special units should fly off with an Air Force Airbus and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
American House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress has just failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries around 227 the American representative house rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and prominent politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets would have to be curbed.
In a dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited members to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While suffrage was taking place, Dow Jones collapsed more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
He resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme comes into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased clearly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the desire of Germans to travel according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for tourism DRV made known in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market research institute investigation there are increased booking quotas even for autumn months.
Therefore the surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would have been about 11%, the DRV reported.
The GfK figures are a prerequisite for these results, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and provides statistical projections for the whole market.
Also included are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, required in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations to the Germans in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as places within Germany.
Above all, all-inclusive travel has a high rating, said DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually organised holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for reservations made in advance or offers with everything included, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would have been a turnover surplus again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann's Hits, one-liter mug beer and a VIP in Dirndln griffati.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kanancucker and I actually have not much in common.
She's blonde, she's a TV moderator, and she's wearing a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
One thing, however, is common to us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers launch against us and take photos until they fill the memory of the cameras - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to achieve his goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident to the north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume / dress to date is still kept within limits.
But when you get to Theresienwiese, it's not a big deal.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monk points out to me that I would have fastened the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I sneak up on the bow from the back to the left.
All right, "he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which head "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "ooooo."
That tells me, after he got rid of his one-liter beer mug he drank earlier.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
Bob is one of these notorious Wildbiesler.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol like this.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening, the sanitary workers walk in packs on the square of the feast, who have to take care of the poor beons.
Nurses appear in packs every time - always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered with tent in tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie under the tarp in this blood-alcohol coffin can't be seen.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," screams to me one of the sanitary men and disappears into the barondo.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building is straddling between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some provincial German municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard to the imperial game, wanted to fulfil its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and ruling forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disrepair, largely overtaken by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever greater diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish Government has a remarkable relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the bed car for the Turkish capital Ankara, visiting one of the main foreign policy experts of AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a rush along the slopes that produced the cadences from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and pastry shops of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly, "he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out one point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: the links between the Middle East and the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastwards through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's medium-eastern ambitions can now largely be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe."
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should make demands on this fascinating country.
Lives remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 11 September) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir in charge.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21 / under 21 years old, but at the time when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that music had to do, both madrigals and messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So sing it! "
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial nor flourished.
Whatever the standard of music was, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor were to be named knight, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his own words, simply "rode around the world one or two well-known battle horses."
So many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD."
This follows from the note of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino" Flamenco y vida, "because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments. "
Second assault on Honda supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitation, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
To everything you have to add a refined mechanics, which increases the driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model earlier than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, ie 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to do this, Honda is confident that another new model will arrive.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units per year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, shortly after its presentation in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3,90 meters (five centimeters more), the width is 1,69 meters (two centimeters more) and the gap is 2,50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is extended.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - equipped with double background - rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - relate to an improvement in the accessibility of rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, open in fact with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to take advantage of a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horsepower in the first generation model, 100 horsepower is now available.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese society has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C constitutes an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During the flight, each bee creates its own space of oval shape which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in his personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined as a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
"At the moment when it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot divert upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can turn its wheels and not take infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process information every few seconds, and act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so it can work without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor mega. "
This is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination avoiding obstacles in the path.
Tremble before asking for a loan
We must recognise that the US Treasury Department, as well as having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel."
In other words, the "bad credit hotel..." or problems.
The bleak aspect of this arrangement and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce us to think not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do that, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, a songo room appears inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even mean...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, that it will invest nine billion dollars in a quota pairs to 21% participation in the Company, news received following a net decrease of its shares on the Stock Exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The price fixed is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the total operation would be carried out on the base of an average price of 29 dollars in title, that is a percentage inferior to its current course of 28%.
By 5: 00 p.m., however, the Morgan Stanley title dropped by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition into bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions, but put them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than previously assumed.
The Monday modalities also show that in the last few days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum equal to 8,5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained:" We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimise the risks and protect ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis. "
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, or about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow MUFG to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has specified to have "clearly" lightened own budget beginning from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a lot of pressure on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has risen.
However, this cost fell back on Monday to a high level of around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch takeover, announced that they had raised 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa à Quito, ce lundi.
Establish the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on an 80% vote basis.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% blank cards.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of "yes," placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night between Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive mandates of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to use this amendment and to re-propose its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13,9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoner in the desert for ten days were returned on Monday afternoon, safe and sound, to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at the military base in Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15: 30, aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been thrown from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the agency organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 Special Forces members, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the person responsible who requested to maintain anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces from Belgrade.
We must admit that if we have achieved this, it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces, "he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle aboard which the kidnappers were aboard and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be tied to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA _ U), which was immediately denied by the Sudan.
Reading - The silent majority of culture
On the front page there is a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
So much the better.
But part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the meagre sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical starvation sites?
What politician would dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and property buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all of this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped together in 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and property, preserve private archives and archaeological sites with little money.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty first in Europe due to the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide €11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been fighting for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this respect may set a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell by almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the entire capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's management, this value is not real.
The corporate summit imputes the collapse of Fortis actions to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly rose again.
Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's clients. The branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the hen house
In America, life and health insurers, according to people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data of medicines depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken house to the fox "- writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescription of medicines.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount payable in the event of a claim subject to the health status of any customer and shall not take out the insurance if they consider the risk to be too high.
A long time ago, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is in practice unconditionally high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not have much left in addition to paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the counter is that some medicines can be used for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is a risk factor, the first two are not.
For the request and data processing have formed separate companies and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities now force them to do so even though they have not yet imposed fines for negligence.
Some firms have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers to the specialized companies in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that connects the forwarding of data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not conclude the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Marsigliese Global Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are primarily trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this theme, as well as all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal first of all with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So there was no emphasis on this at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Foreign Representative, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in 5 years, that is to say to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms on both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it is continuing in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees with this, as does the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference scheduled for next year and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going today to the French capital where a bilateral meeting is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French firms will receive €20 billion in order to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro who will represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in pavilion 5.0 of Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular on the one for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane was found missing a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who died on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The Madeira County sheriff John Anderson escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63rd-year-old billionaire was given for death in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was sighted, a team of investigators were sent, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes residence.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research was discontinued a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on a balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without a stop.
Among his many records, also that of flying at 15.445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the box with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a breath of news in this sector.
Due to its content outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising batting that will accompany the debut of the new car will start a new mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D affissions, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A maxi-poster project, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertising.
Can you use this formula to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National Team for years and that, to be honest, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia are added groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English tifosteria.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi fan shop, the Levski one.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all nominative, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crime, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented travel.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international event that prevents people from attending not only the Italian stadiums but throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimise those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small group of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms can count on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, which deals with precisely the problems from stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the stretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...."
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Observatory of Viminale for a few weeks (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been Quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistles of Mameli's hymn: even those are not crime, but if you allow me, they are not education.... "
