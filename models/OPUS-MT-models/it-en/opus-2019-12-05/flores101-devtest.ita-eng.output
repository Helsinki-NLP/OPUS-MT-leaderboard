The US Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognises the absolute need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has said, namely that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and of their sport, can be better served by carrying out a significant change within our organization, and not by decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely used theory, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid colouration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information on the evolution of birds' feathers.
As dinosaur plumage does not have the basic structure, so-called rachis, but has other typical features of feathers, beards and barbules, researchers have concluded that rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The plumage structure suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courting. Researchers speculate that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chicken duvet.
According to researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage and not that of a chick.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the reliefs carried out by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exercises a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exercises a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects as "normal" matter.
This theory claims that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a sort of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Enterprise left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla has suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
The weapon of Uka did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, he is blind from one eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconferencing from an USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two single races of the Championships.
The first one in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which it participated, the giant slalom, saw it ranked tenth in the female group of the category "seated," with a combined journey time of 4: 41.30, slower than 2: 11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1: 09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descent, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Slalom Gigante did not qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people were arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the crash of the car were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrook's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is detained waiting for trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other of suspects, walk on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has pointed out to journalists that no new comments will be issued at least until the formal indictment.
According to leaked, the document will be the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on existing borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence only for five years.
Shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of the hunting programme of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth provisional election council in Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, against the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure of the elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that they are aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
In its reply, the Ministry described Apple's deferral of the report as "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake in the Marianas was felt at 07: 19 local time (21: 19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands no damage has been reported in the country.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his rifle M16 Rolando Mendoza set the tourists on fire.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released immediately along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
In 1959, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" with flight records on Wednesday.
Even his wrestling buddies wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was as strange as me... Maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia's transition to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim prime minister Julia Gillard said he believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of participants in the survey, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
On the opposite side of the survey, 29% of respondents claim that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters free style and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but it has accused several ailments that have led to doubt of its physical form.
He could not take the drugs necessary to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known until today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that led to water and organic matter on earth, that is matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists wish to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "talk and political nonsense."
It is assumed to be a candidate for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aeroplanes more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while no car park or interchange parking is available on site.
The fears of the absence of the means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the game played under closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time needed for this process was much longer; this is due to the coupling between an endemic finch of Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the finch of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in the books called "illuminated codes" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color based on how acid or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the test chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the humidity present on your hands and the outer layers there will be a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have discovered remains of sewerage networks.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in the public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To phone someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the atmosphere of the Earth partially distorts light and vision.
A rocket of more than 100 feet is required to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to provide us with easier and faster transport.
Thanks to its invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport have made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
The lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called flocks.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big felines), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a tensile force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and rabid words.
The ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (preys) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage with the surrounding environment and then dropping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates itself from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, in order to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those necessary previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
The plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of his era and therefore feared nothing but the other mosasaur.
From his long jaws there were more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus a further row on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called a ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich men loved to feast together while lying on their side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each god a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurat, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate in the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although all are "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "The Mystery of Templars," you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
However, this is false, although it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776." The text appears upside down at the end of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (size 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be placed.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only on purpose as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and allied with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragoon."
The American forces and those of the Free French had liberated the South of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis," that is citizen, and "civitas," that is city or city-state, and in some way defines therefore also the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Statutes of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their own acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to change the articles it was necessary the unanimous consent of all states. These for their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," considered the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when the European sailors who were passing by soon recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan in 1624, starting a transformation concerning the cereal production systems of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan end up under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Shimonoseki Treaty and thus ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site was recovered, but restoration work is still underway.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the age of analogue photography.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its appearance ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely enough, the size 35 mm is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3: 2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are the same or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derided third party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and custom differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civil supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent the access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and brutalities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, many nobles fighting for the throne waged fierce wars.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and does not belong to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the military rankings, instead of being class-based, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passing of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if one knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a great amount of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one arrived today not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), various smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arch up" sign looks like a V and the "arch down" sign looks like a paper clip or a square without the bottom side.
To the top means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and to the bottom means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it turns out a stronger and stronger sound.
You can choose to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the marks of the archeggio you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, to their two young children (Mary Theresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and screaming threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point in the crowd, someone showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits behind American imperialism.
To understand the Templars you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice includes a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that the destiny of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have arisen linked to such geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige decreased, especially because the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and the XIV century.
Initially, clothing suffered the strong influence of eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practised for the sole purpose of producing sufficient to meet the food needs of the farmer / farmer and his family.
Survival farming is a simple system, usually of a biological type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically, a large part of the farmers were subsistence farmers, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
The subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel representative of the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and / or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyse some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment on the part of the parents.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before leaving or fleeing.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally bred by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the shelf goes a little further.
Shelving is not a learning mode, the more a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as it may be using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Shelving can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "shelving," but so is Microsoft Office's little clip-shaped assistant.
Virtual shelving is integrated into the software and aims to question, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
Children are put into foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nourishment, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to meet all unfulfilled needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995) are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet.
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The Speech of the President," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such skills in interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and expressed variability.
The mutation adds a new genetic variability, with the selection being eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans it is difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should not be surprising that our ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10-60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on bioritmo include the consumption of many fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This objective is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayan rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an all-encompassing love path.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (lighting energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
The Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various divinities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment develops.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the system conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans were, however, immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for freight transport is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always the task of the marines is that to guarantee to the Country the safeguard of own ability to move people and goods, contrasting at the same time the ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this and most noteworthy theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it did in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, fleece, flesh and skin.
The domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of sheep farming are still used nowadays.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, the Wagonways, when compared with the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed the horses who travelled to them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels. In 1767 the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Human beings began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk normally erect.
Signs of specialization for the bipedal gait are present in Australopiteco fossils dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printer just a few blocks away.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Dunlap Posters."
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edged Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists of today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay the eggs and walk on the two back legs.
Ultimately, manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis for all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, or 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of a container of medicines or open harmful chemicals.
Check if the label contains first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both the murderous bedbugs and bedbugs are nests, that is adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records around 400,000 known cases, leading to neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a central nervous system disease of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or in their own child's.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not just a question of experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations makes it possible to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Organic watches are independent oscillators, the free cycle of which continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriofagi, meaning viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriofago with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriofago with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the part of the genetic material involved and whether the cells involved belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on the spot include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small country country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic move, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time supports.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere beyond one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution in the last two million years.
Each person participates in social life and uses the transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or decks falling into ruins.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically mathematically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape with more ease from enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are favoured by the ability to fold wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small lanyards to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist nowadays, the only ones who are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth's moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries an amount of water of 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river Rio delle Amazoni is 6,387 km long (3,980 miles), flowing the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
They continued to build pyramids in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of Vatican City for official legislation and communication is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, they also theorized that they became new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, metals such as silver and gold also exist.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and a less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission bomb.
Basically, it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, by further dividing the core, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and / or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and motivates them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most common content are the Theory of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he needs to change the entire work of the team and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often have the function of point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, as meetings can take place according to the different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation be willing to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? Innovation can be a good reason to implement the concepts of organisational learning.
When you manage to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leaders need to create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organisations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes never seen before.
This offers us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong science fiction connotation, the IA represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent machine behavior, learning and adaptation.
Research on AI includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The IA system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The trips are a fundamental part of the teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that can not be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share experiences and reflections of travel with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a little painstaking grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within other people's writings, as well as outlining their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The larger areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If a comparison of the population is made, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For Travellers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of the actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider a harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merens.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather articles, narghilè and a lot of fine jewellery, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the streets of the city, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorbike) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 francs Congolese for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctut" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the Henry Louis Gates special of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main milestones.
With its more arabeggiante than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the others in the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located to the north-east of South Africa and winds to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km ², the park comprises 14 different eco-zones, each of which provides livelihoods for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
Most urban development on the island of Hong Kong has concentrated on the densely populated, reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is named after Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km ², of which about a third are swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those headed east and Jakar / Bumthang) leave between 06: 30 and 07: 30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a narrow bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the space in free vertical is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in the present Eastern Paraguay. They were semi-omad hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and native natives.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonizations.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and games also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the peripheral islands they will not accept credit cards, although the British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, they are summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30 ° C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons defined: the amount of rain is kept almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards / m from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards / m from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population counts little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the sadly known naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 lives in the United States and Germany were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
They are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These beaches are suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better deal with the trip.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, flat white coffee comes from a foreign idea. The espresso is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions on the reef are carried out and the injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the directions and pay particular attention to the security notices.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period you can only find occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of the saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be submitted to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
During some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this as a crucial element of their experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is finished, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the crossing of the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to dedicate to the exploration of the city. Passengers of the cruises are granted an exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much as possible the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are neither windows, nor watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests' mood up, make sure they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On frozen and snow-covered carriages, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive like when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in no time that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow bursts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to journeys made by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
The lions, the cheetahs and the leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not reach until July 2020 at the end of March 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 ¥and 130,000 ¥, while normal tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
Draining wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing stretched socks, you can try it with a hair dryer, if you have it at your disposal.
Care should be taken not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, at worst, burns.
There are various ways to heal water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The efficiency of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not diffused in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy products free of taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, you should keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km / h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely enough, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile phone service is much higher than in other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighbouring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German bakery cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but tasty desserts can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can occur both "dry" and "wet," depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, for curries in inland regions, yoghurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely diffused throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Giavanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the feet of the rider and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the knight but can present security problems for the possibility that the feet of the knight will be stuck there.
If a jockey gets thrown by a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrups, he could be dragged by the fleeing horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Then some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather bracket detach from the saddle when, in case of fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as South American Yosemite, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs were built.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new paths on its potentially endless walls.
Snow sports in free descent, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Ski is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (skis), who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport originated at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegian.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it does not usually understand them, to the ski touring or to the skimo, which are practiced on steep soils and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances in some way greater than those travelled by walking, but only very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel across multiple countries you should apply for a visa and pass for passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thereby saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique piece. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences in relation to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all the Sámi have been involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as working animals.
Today many Sámi operate modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a mistaken perception of Roma people.
If a warning for travellers is issued for the destination you visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may be interested in the views of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that those opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions' means the general expression of any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause harm, serious social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in any part of the world, and there are different types of weather, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Heavy winds, hail, precipitation above normal and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are torments, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are recommended to seek information on adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may influence travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
The books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no information on sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents is also variable.
Security inspections have also become much more thorough in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Reaching currents are the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the flow of return is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back won't be harder than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or evaluate whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (since there is a smaller "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights of the pyramid is as interesting as there is in the area for children.
Before the show begins, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
The southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a volcano still active filled with water from its origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge in the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you must be in the open air with the view clear to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure boats, as well as by missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among the neoplomates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, entering a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually the enrolment to these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of the Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There's no need for a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are definitely large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where you count one boat every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is quite unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for the descent to the ground (from 2009 onwards) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can frighten people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar from the personal fears and feelings that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people to understand a little how planes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On certain routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get him there faster would be to send him as a hold baggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to spend a nice amount for privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for first class trips!
In general, direct flights from A to B are not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business class seats.
The airlines are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and consequently apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Smirne is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the market of the 18th century and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the church square, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The line bus Scotturb 403 regularly connects to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common grave, and it has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made them work to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by almost everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to be well in Paris continues to be to behave as best as possible, as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person. This will greatly facilitate your travel.
The rough exterior appearance of the Parisians will vanish quickly if you show off some basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mostly beech, peck and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different levels of altitude, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also houses a huge variety of animal species and birds.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the rooster, next to several other most widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or from the nun to the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers under their knees.
These too can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Maiorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is made of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the seasonings available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei," always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to be taken care of are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also be sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while wagon means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding phrases.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with little knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Usually nowadays, early modern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are enormous structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blooming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was native to China, where the flowering of the prunes was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blooming festivities were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocracy members close to the imperial court.
The plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, also collecting some specimens of plants will cost you to get away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-shoot city; you can buy pretty much anything once you get there.
But being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and in the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and very well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions linked to this feast have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place in order to admire the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but this could be a very good pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches a Easter vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations that often begin the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands reached us by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This meant that the giant turtle became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the man arrived.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the northern aurora, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often no problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which the Westerners tend to be accustomed.
The office clothes are normally made up of a jacket and tie or suit and are addressed to colleagues with their last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors on every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
