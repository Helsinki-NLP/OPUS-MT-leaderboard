This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely diffused, but provides more details than fossils, such as three-dimensional color and arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale color or carotenoid at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but has other characteristics typical of the feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the regulation of the temperature or for the courtship. The researchers assume that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the exhibit shows an adult plumage and not the chick down.

This morning the indictment officer, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP in the government. Norman Lamb MP is expected to play the role of Minister for Businesses left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the courts in Westminster is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden of 25 years, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback of 21 years.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded by an eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified by videoconference from a USF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her ranking tenth in the female group of the category "seduti" with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 Slalom Gigante participants did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people were arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the crash of the car were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is held awaiting trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters and the Scottish courts have considered the publication of potentially harmful photos.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has the general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has made it clear to journalists that no new comments will be made at least until the formal act of indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement has been signed, Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and security instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Election Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which contest the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure of the elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and causing mild burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
In its reply, the Ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely regrettable."
The earthquake in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals going on.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released immediately with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
After attending obstetrics training, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor.
Your research has shown that administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two black boxes with flight records.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay homage to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Far. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place" was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections, people who were opposed to Australia's transition to a republic rose by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, claimed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the opposites of the survey, 29% of respondents claim that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100-200-metre freestyle and three-storey Commonwealth Games, but it has accused several ailments that have led to doubt of its physical form.
He could not take the medicines needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the first number ever known to this day.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that have brought water and organic matter to earth, that is, matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes legal marriage between people of the same sex.
According to him, speculation is nothing but "chatter and political nonsense."
A candidacy for the Presidency is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than outdated ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while no parking spaces for cars or interchange parking spaces are available on site.
The fears of the absence of means of transport have brought out the possibility of having the game held necessarily behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this is due to the effect of the coupling between a Darwin endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the finch of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alcalin) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the test chemical is given by the quantity of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewage systems have been discovered.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in the public bathrooms, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To phone someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transports.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport have made their appearance.
Below them are other medium - sized cats that feed on medium - sized preys, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that feed on small preys, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular objective that every feline has and that allows it not to compete with others.
The lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually, females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other great cats), also with regard to the mortal attacks on their preys.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (even if not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exercise a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of yelled and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the preys they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, in addition to being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots blend with the surrounding environment and then fall on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move past a mountain range or river, or move to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), they will probably find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, in order to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it resembles less and less the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
The plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants the animals could not survive.
The mosaur was the superpredator of his age and for this reason he feared nothing but the other mosaurs.
More than 70 sharp teeth sprang out of his long jaws like razors, plus a further row on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had the forked tongue. Its feeding included turtles, large fishes, other mosauri and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked whatever came into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called wolf.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together while lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods, coming to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for every god a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of divinities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red gave her the name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all of them were "scandian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars," you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
Anyway, this is fake, even though it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be placed.
Probably, therefore, the record was only intended as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragoon."
The American forces and those of the French Free had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and headed for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis," that is, citizen, and "civitas," that is, city or city-state, and in some way defines therefore also the size of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, thus not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only member of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was necessary. They for their part had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team is, together with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and has won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands are part of the Japanese (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," given the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by shortly recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, starting a transformation that concerned the production systems of the aboriginal cereals and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared Qing Empire province.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki thus surrendering Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site was recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the age of analogue photography.
It is still produced today and, what is most important, its aspect ratio is inherited from the formats of digital camera image sensors.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often mocked rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was inclined to be under examination.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and custom differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and heinousness of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his former manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power was a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, among many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars were waged.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent times in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all men candidates, allowing the most ambitious and lucky to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since the military rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave stands on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if it knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large amount of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has come to this day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" to a paperclip or a square devoid of the lower side.
Upwards it means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards it means that you should start from the alamar (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it results in a louder and firmer sound.
You may decide to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the signs of the arch that you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in fear, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds swung in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits behind US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 A.D.).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the costs of ownership of a car.
Mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the treatment of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have arisen related to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than the laws imposed in an arbitrary way.
Like Paris, now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued about 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige decreased, especially because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing sufficient to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of biological type, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belongings through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, have grown without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in wild nature.
When the feral child is totally bred by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, the more a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, how can it be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are given in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nourishment, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the foster care will cover all unfulfilled needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, as important reasons for using the Internet, "learning" and "socialisation" are suggested (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relations."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and express variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of variability expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive apparatus similar to that of human beings it is difficult to meet its own needs of amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10-60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset your watch in your sleep, you can put it across the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
Less is the tension, the more positive is the existing life force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayan rite and by various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an all-inclusive path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. By depicting various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been raided; the only option was to retreat and reorganise along the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for freight transport is surely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee to the country the safeguard of own ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies did not succeed, Germany would probably have had the opportunity to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by ancient cultures and tribes to easily have milk, fleece, flesh and skin available.
Domestic goats were usually reared in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used nowadays.
Already in the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply formed by parallel wooden boards, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that crossed them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, even if iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 the first rails completely made of iron appeared.
The first means of transport that man knew were his legs. Human beings started walking in a position erected two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "The Dunlap Posters."
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and was commissioned by John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had its troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of drugs or open harmful chemicals.
Check if first aid instructions for that specific poison are on the label.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with the bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both the killer bugs and the bedbugs are nestling, that is adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which are part of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The research showed that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most of the scientific investigation in fact.
But this is not just about experimentation, because an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows you to orient scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophagi, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the part of the genetic material involved and whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic driveway, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Each person participates in social life and uses transport systems, most of which complain about.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that fall into ruins.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and of the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be generally represented mathematically.
To achieve a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been linked: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from enemies and to find food and companions in a more efficient way.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings down the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeral ones.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth's moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an 8-fold amount of water from the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water flowing from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river Rio delle Amazoni is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never exceeded in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The Vatican City language for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most people who work within the State, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually resemble more than the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, it also theorized that they would become new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and they never need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb's operation.
Basically, it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So by further splitting the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break in the presence of a low or nothing thrust.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what pleases or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and move them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the theories on the most common contents are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put disciplinary actions into practice, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the whole work of the team and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation have the will to deal with the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organisational learning can be innovation.
When you manage to use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the survey of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and cancer can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been observed before.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong scientific fictional connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the development of automated operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The IA system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Tours are a key part of teaching. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also an excellent pretext for sharing experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by a poorly cured grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving writing.
The blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The larger northern areas are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildlands.
If a comparison is made of the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travelers: it is recommended that all of them declare that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghiliè and a lot of chincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those of the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before carrying out any visits outside Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included on the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabish than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the others of the country.
The Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which sustains a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a sparkling bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong island has concentrated on the reclaimed land of the north coast, densely populated.
This is the place the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a narrow bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guyana.
Its two trellis have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two 3.50 meters wide lanes.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in the present eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and they also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived on hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "La grande provincia delle Indie," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonizations.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its autochthonous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and games at other times of the year.
To receive information about the tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank of the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
UK pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often pay even with US credit cards and dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands they will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons defined: the amount of rain is kept almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of man, wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking food with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the sadly known naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
They are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
They are beaches suitable for families sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better face the trip.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. "Espresso' is black short coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and accidents for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, stick to directions, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubemeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can be found only occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
Booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often conclude agreements with certain hotels, but you can still book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even package combination flight+hotel.
They can also keep your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most of the participants decided to camp on site, considering this as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space near the music.
Remember that once music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted an exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much time and money as possible spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests' moods up so that they hold back.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced and you cannot drive like when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in no time can fall so much snow that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow bursts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safari are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the heart of the holiday of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympic Games were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, however most of the cancellation policies related to coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost about 7,000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can facilitate drying. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing boards, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hairdryer if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinking or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles coming from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not diffused in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
Exposed speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighbouring Austria to the south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often accompany very well a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small sweets but rich in flavor, can orient themselves on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry may be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid contained.
Yogurt is normally used in northern India and Pakistan for curries in the hinterland regions; coconut milk is most commonly used in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the coconut sugar of Javanese) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet will be blocked there.
If a jockey gets jumped by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, it may be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that you can take.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the British ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather bracket remove from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new routes on its walls, potentially endless.
Sports on the snow downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve slipping on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the skiers), who dedicate entire periods of vacation to skiing in a particular area.
The principle at the base of skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the depiction of skiing humans date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to the hiking one.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way greater than those walked by walking, but only very rarely you will reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you should apply for a visa and pass for passport control several times.
However, with regard to this aspect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact a piece of antiques. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition shows geographical differences from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have been involved in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale; some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as working animals.
Today many Sámi practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of Sámi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a warning for travellers is issued for the destination you visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or insurance in case of cancellation of your trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic with respect to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression of any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social hardships or loss of human lives.
In every part of the world extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types of weather, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong bursts of wind, hail, over-precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are torments, snowstorms, ice storms and sand storms.
It is recommended that travellers inform themselves about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is potentially considered a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first-aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning surgery to change sex abroad must make sure they have the valid documents for their return journey.
Governments' intention to issue unsex (X) passports or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections at security controls have also become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Racing currents are formed by the return flow of the waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
In view of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can be formed.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it won't be harder to swim back than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for help, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
The shock from return manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a "moon of honey" phase) lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness needed even for those who return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the most interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Reclaiming from various countries, the Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George is the largest island and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands there are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge in the plateau, and then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with a clear view up to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including recreational craft, as well as missions that need data and voice from a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about your connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education on return to your home country.
Usually enrollment to these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of the Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
It doesn't have to be a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where you count one boat every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa (starting in 2009) will not be required for the descent to the ground using on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people, understanding how planes work and what happens during a flight may prove useful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or not being in control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some journeys the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would require days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster would be to ship it as a hold baggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for first class ones!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on seats in first class or in business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox religion.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Izmir is spread over a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city you can breathe an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are studded by the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the market of the eighteenth century and by mosques and ancient churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or put to work until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid holocaust or Nazi jokes.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known practically by everyone.
However, most signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the subway, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any interruptions in the unscheduled service are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris continues to be to behave better, relating as a "bien élevé" person (well educated). This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rough exterior appearance of Parisians will quickly fade away if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mostly beech, pecci and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also houses a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer stoles for women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants under their knees.
Also these can be borrowed at the warehouse at the entrance; however the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is made of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Sei," always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to be taken care of are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimum knowledge of Spanish can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Premodern observers are usually obsolete nowadays and act as museums or educational sites.
Since the light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes designed for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was originally from China, where the blossoming of the plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
The plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy to travel city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "tropical highs," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and in the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and bike paths very well known.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions related to this festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the Easter night staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to springtime and fertility.
In the most traditional Churches a Easter vigil is celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations that often start the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands would swim, fly or float.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This made the giant turtle become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you can experience the polar night when the sun remains under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the northern dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
The office clothing is usually made up of a jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with their surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than commending individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors about each decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
