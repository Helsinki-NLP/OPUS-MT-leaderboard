The triumph of the right populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the sub-prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006 but loses 5.5%.
Even worse for ÖVP, which loses almost 9% of the votes with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war Austrian history, and above all the literally catastrophic outcome of the people, who led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in their preference before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the early reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more probable way out of the electoral outcome, that is to say towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) have gained 18% in advance and the BZÖ 11% in votes - but the Social Democrats have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even grounds for sanctions by the Euopean Union.
On this evolution Haider obviously plays, which has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to enter the Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, said that Czech-Indian relations should be cooled.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished by a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher court.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Mr Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke similarly during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into this is to lend the condemned the "competent legal support," said the Indian Minister.
At the same time he said that such support is already lending it to the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he obtained from the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"L" island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers of Division OSN for issues on oceans and maritime rights.
His boss, Czech lawyer, director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest bottom of the mainland
The coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, that is, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention it has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In short, the continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country is submitting before the Committee on the Defining of the continental shelf should be accompanied by very extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical and professional help.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominated were successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has been echoed worldwide.
But also New Zealand has gained - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will profit him in the future from the seabed, as they are promised will be priceless.
Other states too will gradually present their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean bottom, which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity, begins.
No one here has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, exaggeratingly, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarked and their regime established in a contractual manner."
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now belongs also to the Czech Republic.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, it acquired the status of so-called "pioneer investor" according to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"E" can be extracted from the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a deposit rich in polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the Macedonia division Rober Sandev brings with him an artifact to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary shechem, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages - the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
In the rescue operation the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior have participated German special units.
In addition to military specialists, GSG9 units were present on site, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the technical institution's logistical experts.
As the spokesman for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of force intervention, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says an internal ministry spokesman.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers on September 19 in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remained secreted as well as the details of the liberation or possible redemption payments.
The freed in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
It didn't explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin until they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 holidaymakers and special units are expected to fly with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 items in about 227, the US representative house rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and prominent politicians of both parties there had been no majority for the program, with which the chaos of financial markets should have been curbed.
In a dramatic action supporters desperately tried to persuade critics from the heavy package of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders, incited the MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points while the vote was in progress.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapse again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased clearly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic views, the desire to travel by Germans, according to a survey, remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a 31% turnover plus compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for tourism DRV announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are booking fees increased even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, DrV informed.
Important for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, which would be required in particular to travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all inclusive trips have a high listing, explained Drv Klaus Laepple's president.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be" better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would be again a surplus of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has dropped.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one-litre mug beer and vip in Dirndln branded.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, unites us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, photographers already jump at us and take photos until they fill the memory of the cameras - very flattering, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist to Wiesn and actually living north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to date remains within limits.
But once we get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A monacense points out to me that I would tie the apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow" .
I sneak up on my bow from behind to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which head "To drink to get dressed!" and iron the back naked against an uninvited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "oooooo" scramble..
That tells me, after he got rid of his glass of beer from a liter he drank before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks it's a trash can.
Bob is one of these infamous Wildbiesler.
Others aren't lucky enough to get rid of alcohol like this.
About 8 p.m. they walk in a pack on the square of the feast, the sanitary men, who have to take care of the poor blondes.
Nurses appear each time in a pack - always 4 at a time dragging a stretcher covered with a tent into a tent.
This works as with most visitors to Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Who lies under the tarp in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the sanitary men yells at me and disappears into the coffin.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking to the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly decaying.
But once inside the office ticket from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retarded imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is Saudi Arabia today.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news about Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917 an ammo train broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone into decay, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever-greater diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed away.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the bed car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish congressman Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy run along the slopes that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state willing to turn my back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by commercial centers means built and confections of power, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't about one or the other.
It's got to be both.
"But surely at some point, " I ask, " will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he emphasized a point that almost all those with whom I spoke here have recited by heart: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's medium-oriental ambitions can now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe."
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent was to make claims on this fascinating country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his scheme of music for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under 21, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mute) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said: "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowered.
Whatever the musical standard, it made him more and more elevate.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight as an orchestra conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and over I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his own words, simply "ridden around the world one or two well-known battle horses."
He's gonna miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your William Woodruff obituary (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblin-Norman... while studying for a degree in science, one in letters, and one in PhD."
This comes from the note of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida," because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda supersells
In November the Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
To everything must be added a refined mechanics, that increases the comfort of driving and allow to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before passing on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique sales phenomenon.
This is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model in 2007, estimates for 2009 are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Honda . to reduce by good measure the decrease of the sales in Spain.
In fact, the managers of the company plan to arrive to the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, that is 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to succeed, the Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - whose Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3,90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the interasse 2,50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior also expands.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution adopted also in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the boot capacity - with double background - rises to 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 motor version, and that the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, even the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with petrol engine 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C constitutes an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what they called a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which they can turn its wheels and not using endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers ahead, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, or mega gigabytes."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the instant prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination avoiding the obstacles present in the path.
Tremble before you ask for a loan
We must recognize that the US Treasury Department, as well as having many capital to intervene, is certainly not devoid of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with junk mortgages in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel."
In other words, the "Hotel of Bad Credits" ... or problems.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do that, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the wide audience.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, a songo room appears inside the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of participation in the Company, news received as a result of a sharp decrease of its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The price fixed shall be 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of 31.25 dollars, ensuring a yield of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the total operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars in title, that is a percentage inferior to its current course of 28%.
At around 5 p.m., however, the Morgan Stanley title fell by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by making them pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the previous one.
The modalities defined Monday also show that in the last few days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of 8.5 billion dollars.
"One week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation in the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide details of the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
The Morgan has stated that it has "clearly" lightened its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares being halved while the cost of risk insurance has risen.
However, the cost was still high on Monday, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa à Quito, please.
Found the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave a voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a vote basis of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes," placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night between Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly in accordance with the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planification of development" of a country that lives essentially of the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year term, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to renew its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back on Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., on a special plane.
Aboard a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential outskirts of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the agency organizer of the safari.
One Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were shots fired, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the person responsible who requested to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos would support them.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were found and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), which was immediately denied by the Sudan Liberation Movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will decide to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that hunger?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and property buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon, in the Loire valley?
With our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
At least 40 000 volunteers in Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Companies of Quebec, are grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and assets, and preserve private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in trouble first in Europe due to the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide € 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland agreed at the highest level on the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties facing the international financial market for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will determine almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including, first of all, the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions began with a vertical collapse, serious signals of crisis of the institute were then presented in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
Bank shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the entire capital value of the group is around €14 billion, but according to the bank's managers this value is not real.
The company summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx has been appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has submitted a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the bank's customers there was no panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of personal medical data.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the henhouse to the fox," writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick as the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount due in the event of claims to the health of the customer and if they consider the risk to be too high, they shall not conclude the insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper process: based on the customer's identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacies on which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is basically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer therefore beyond the paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines can be used for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance - commercial point of view, is worth as a factor of increase of risk, the first two not.
For the request and processing of data, companies have been formed separately and these, before obtaining from the pharmacies the necessary information, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines on negligence.
Some firms have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's state of health.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control competence to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that's why he has developed a program that links data transmission with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
So in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth meeting at the summit was also dominated by this issue, as well as all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. to increase to EUR 100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted attention to global matters.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for a UN conference to be convened.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its continued energy and climate programme, which would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be concluded at the climate conference planned for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will now travel to the French capital where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive a contract worth EUR 20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the ceremony of inauguration of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally present with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authorship books on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people, gradually decreases.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who died on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff then pointed out that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the shipwreck was sighted, a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents under the name Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he traveled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A SUV out of the box with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This, in short, is the last Glk born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a breath of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
Thus the advertising beating that will accompany the debut of the new car will start a new mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affissioni, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the central Milanese shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will get the impression that the car comes out of the manifesto.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of car communication.
Will you succeed with this formula to tease the interest of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspus.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the blue national team for years and that so far, to be honest, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever collided with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have added groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi fan, the Levski fan.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fans for the game: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspus in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had been rejected in fact the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take steps: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspus that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but the whole of Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they'll never set foot in a stadium again.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminal.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of the match of the National Team Wednesday in Lecce."
In Puglia in fact there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms, which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is the secret services, which deals precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the stretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime" ....
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the commissioner of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to sing to the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not become a sociologist - adds No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the event takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about Mameli's hymn whistles: even those are not crime, but if you allow me, they are not education."
