The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the day's collapse before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
Thus, even from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Falling stock in Asia
On Tuesday the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day have subsequently erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has dropped 3.8% while markets have been closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses settled to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world," noted Hong Kong's Head of Currencies Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, even though it is part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also experience consequences.
Massacre of American Actions
The US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, for which USD 700 billion (almost twelve billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions Monday experienced a massacre and the main indices of the actions have been the biggest collapse for over twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a collapse of this size was observed last time in 1987.
The index was down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given way: the US government can give $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and vote on it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told the agency Reuters, the chairman of the Barney Frank room's banking and financial services committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economics, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
But then we will have the return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, we will reach the aid of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said the democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The delegates of the legislators met the night between Saturday and Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson, to give definitive form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm down investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the finals 350.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overpower its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, namely to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We worked it out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and Monday" as mentioned by the Republican Senator.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesperson, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's positive trend and appreciated "the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restricting the Golden Parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachutes for managers of the companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a big step towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan relies on helping homeowners with payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on installments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Support
The proposed plan is, according to the main steward of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be crucial for how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that this week the representatives of the congress agree on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time," said Marek.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against cell phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why an independent reader should be obtained.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from the qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, your shelves are crowded with hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd perhaps hardly digests the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the life of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't do cell phones by accident.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, call and text, can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe can also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of cell phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and before the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest players) are much more effective.
As for uncountable cheap mobile phones that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem arises when you download music into your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of devices have a USB universal port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the interpreters, the name of the album, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices reproduce only the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should be particularly interested in battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to deal too much with what formats your mobile phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music you get will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, most devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
Prices aren't really very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little bit of a rumble in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless earphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, it has.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of mobile-readers will, for many, be the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for the common headphones.
The best mobile phones and from the technical point of view more equipped and also with the 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) and anyone really can handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or maybe the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping into the launch of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you are part of the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
The basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices feature individual MP3 buttons and the convenience of the service so it approaches the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has made more progress in this area, which mobile phones of the Walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery strength (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing - a virtual operator who obliges traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be for a long time.
We have already written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe.
At the end of the day, ČTÚ also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularising roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high vis-à-vis Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really like to start the confrontation.
Maybe it sounds crazy, even here we have three mobile networks and highly over 100% coverage.
Instead, mobile phone operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense it often emphasizes also the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network doesn't have many possibilities anymore. (Moreover, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant fall in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices resonated in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for operators of this kind and that they can really be successful.
At the end of the day, for example, we must not go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking lies the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to actually work, he needs a lot less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So virtual operators in the world usually show up at low cost, offering cheap calls and text messages, which is often in balance with the supply of the narrowest services
So for example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-target not small.
This operator focuses so to speak specifically on men.
"True men choose the mobile operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be said by us as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have much expectations.
Mobilking will be switched on in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thinking.
Rather on the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to move forward in negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson for the group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have to have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, there is an impenetrable wall of silence around its creation.
"We do not believe that in the Czech market there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefònika O2.
The specific nature of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
Press spokesperson T-Mobil Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with statement O2: "For now we have not noticed any viable and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build" .
He adds: "In the T-Mobil network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we will have had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it might be possible to consider it on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its 3G license requests.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of sharing costs and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with their accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Then why facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about one thing they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was on ČTÚ during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from ČTÚ's web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has been little improved beyond all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place on him and especially on his high demands services."
Of the attitude of mobile operators, however, it is surprising that the Czech regulatory authorities are completely uninterested.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position with regard to all the problems.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa,of the Section for External Relations ÚOHS, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
On the other hand, on the part of the office which must defend the interests of consumers and, on the other hand, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "At abroad where virtual operators commonly work, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises alone.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecoms regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the network operator's agreement is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has - in the end logically - the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are proceeding in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that very similar obstacles are encountered during negotiations with all operators.
Downloading the responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps himself out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recent update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks
While without us noticing it remains the functioning of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These companies publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
It's usually the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer he then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we will be interested, were to be in breach of the contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered the question in question.
But it is unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, thousands of customers can be involved.
No operator defends himself from such an attitude at the same time.
From the activity of these companies they derive a not indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile operators "
But that should be a strange little bit at ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to unmask similar activities, and if it does not wish to do so, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we're not more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant fall in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small a market, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in the developed countries in these very cases the regulatory bodies have intervened in defence not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then we came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others followed him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs launch from one to the other all the time like a hot potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in skills in these cases is more than convenient.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is right and the virtual operator will really soon appear to us, the Czech mobile market will start again.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly ÚOHS could remain impassive to the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj" on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State.
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - solo with male or female voice, choir pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already earlier he said on the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing variants alone, the singers with the young voices most representative, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He gained popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of the Czech Slavic Republic in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will climb in the metro, tram and bus instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At this moment about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card can get it.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day annual one (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their own card charged in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, Můstek, Nádrží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can already be bought yesterday on the internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors in the metro stops where they had to make long lines for paper tickets so far.
The coupon is bought via the internet and on the Opencard they charge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a desk with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record their credit on their card." said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson for the project.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the metro entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," concluded Opatrný.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will run from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card and after payment of the coupon, it will load on.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the integrated transport trains in Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," he explained the method of checking Filip tickets by the organization Ropid, which sets out the timetables for collective transport in Prague.
Urban buses have card readers embedded in the driver's box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the determined point next to the case.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the coupon expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Information on the validity of their documents on the device screen will be displayed here.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This results from the letter filed in the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This results beyond all from the letter kept in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava district" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia again.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units arrive at German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the signed letter with the words "People who hold to Šumava's destiny with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Germans of the Sudeti hope only to brutality, to the lack of regard, to the misunderstanding, to the oppression and to the slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, at all, to the victory of the Allies," is written in the letter.
The reason the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the "Czech oppressors."
If the president of the USA were to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Šumava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the postwar history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to realize that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the people of the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as Budějovice's German in the Baltic Sea's maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans visited him for him to teach him Czech.
"These people believed that once he got home, the Czech would make him feel good," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, counted on the fact that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so you could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start Wednesday.
Minister Aleš's office is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the last professional drivers.
What's gonna appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also borne out by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her own life.
The commercials will "scare" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
This promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or accident.
You have to remember the risk to drivers, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon get confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israel's interim government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of virtually all the occupied territories in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all (busy) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the rumps or the planners to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the mention of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people wounded.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City. .
"He who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he felt was the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollahs (movement of the Shiites); they will have to renounce their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (movement of the Shiites) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the long distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the coach of the Student Agency company came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week's accident with which a 22-year-old hostess died was caused by a truck that cut off the road on the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at that time next to the driver on the less secure spot of the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends whether the bus is equipped with or not standing seats according to the traffic book.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses don't have any standing spaces, as confirmed by Radim Jančura's director at the Aktuáln.cz website.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role - no law deals with regularising this role."
However, no regulation forbids the transporter to carry out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný instead believes, that the law cares enough this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing spaces and maximum limited speed, interurban with standing places with higher masima speed and long-distance without standing seats with the maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Not even there is sure when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can bang his head.
"If the bus makes a sudden braking obviously apply the laws of physics.
Same as on the urban bus or tram.
The carrier company must solve the safety of stewards by means of internal rules," he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering steward services..
This takes about two hundred.
The director doesn't even think their job is dangerous after the accident.
"As soon as I get the feeling that I have to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they ascend.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have stewardesses, we're already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later he will end up in a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples a young hostess of the region of Plzeň has died, who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with an abrupt maneuver, but he hit it with the front right.
Jančura refuses to accept the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats on long-distance buses, they are incedible."
The company plans to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the judgment of the Court to pay the damage to the girl's family, but expects a financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results however.
They are not so much considered by coaches, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the motorway and use of mobile phone during driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard Stewart's activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concluded Mr Havelka, who concluded that control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes bet on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the household staff.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the savings banks' financial group" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf bank with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
In addition, such a union could be a decisive step towards further links in the banks of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate its ability to act.
Since WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having pointed out a long time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the customers of the Savings Banks themselves know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB has certainly been talking about this for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Via Mainza with a national bank such as Helaba or the West LB does not make sense.
However, Deka's board member, who is half brought by regional banks and savings banks consortia, delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with the West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 collaborators is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this threesome.
As soon as the plans were published, the regional bank of Hesse was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But eventually Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Board of Directors, expressed himself against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary for the different houses of the public sector to be brought closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg may first take place.
It's not entirely good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for other mergers increases, the partners will soon be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of the savings banks Assia-Turingia, which participates with 85% of Helaba, put the lock on the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just one thing.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual homes fit together.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with what business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would still not be answered by the German savings bank association.
Eventually, the division of the West LB could also come out, which is naturally not desired by the West LB.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution."
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
THE second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and shows the about 200 travellers what deep tones it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, depart this evening at 23:45 four couriers with destination Munich, Beer Festival" , expected arrival at 6:30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not something for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with a false fur lining and a pair of glasses with silver broad sticks belong to the buses.
They've been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, this year it's 3 tours.
The night trip, during the day at the party, return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the standards of Bavarian authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide - Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they're still gonna need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco: "Knowsciviaggiando.it."
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", quotes Marco in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. on time we meet again here! Understand?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away yellow caps to trees, road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "Italian weekend."
Exact data do not exist, it is said of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco are strengthened with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical treatment) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis began at the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains billionaire credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
An expert in the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion Euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
After all, the losses of the Affiliate Depfa.
The government lender according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in a very short term - which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% out of the EUR 2.37 million, even the share of the equity sold from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared with last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain shares as well as from the liquidation of provisions in loans fell more than 70% over the 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender, after being privatised in 1990, was lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were disembedded in the Aareal Bank.
Given that the income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has committed itself more to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
As early as 2007, they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Defa is an important lender of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have trust deposits from customers.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the granting of loans among banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a part of the Depfa's credit portfolio - about 50 billion. - in the short term refinancing facilities.
According to Hypo Real Estate's notice, the Group's financial needs have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international monetary markets.
From other sources you feel, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the steering committee of HRE Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that the HRE group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the merchantability of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is hoped for by the shares and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be used fully.
But even the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was going to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share class collapses by 75% on the 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good at mortgage courses.
While debts of earlier rank are almost immovable, they give up the courses of postergated credits.
The loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, understandably due beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed like an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, that with the importance of the Defa has settled the crisis, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the least damaged central banks, governments and banks are ready, we can count on a depreciation of the annuality within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information overturned due to partial statizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split up from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains compensation tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to giggle: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Log exchange tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I had a hard time going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself, and luckily I didn't miss it.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
Pupils arrive slowly from 8:00 a.m. until 8:40 a.m. they start a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room."
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who talks in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed up like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana" - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and made a sign, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "nice, sweet."
Then I rushed quickly to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson time had continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was attacked in the true sense of the word.
Everything was chasing and giggling and annoying with questions - then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Everyone in the break opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me a sandwich for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausage, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
Actually, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
Fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put in salt, brrr!
Bento isn't just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared artistically enough, with the hope then to get acquainted with the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them, that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me "
Finally, I have been reading for years with fervor the Mangas.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I began to learn a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced that I was going there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, although Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel the danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it occur if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
For some years, articles from well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge."
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, since we can't even prove that other men have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an unworkable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it completely lacks.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in man's way of speaking: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said that it is linked to the consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the animal's awareness, as it is made, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from that there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analyzed regardless of their contents, and this is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, one passes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for visualization implementation.
What, then, is outlined for feelings?
I blame them on the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In view of this, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the talking nature we create subtle nuances of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio for example believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalus paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, which however has concentrated more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict that, but I think it is indisputable.
Pankseep puts forward arguments that what for rats and humans appears as fear, is probably felt so with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach in case of danger escapes as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any lifelike resemblance.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleo-brains, the cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even when it could be demonstrated for humans: how would you want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows ?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that the same procedure is abandoned in rats and men.
Like I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it about their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than bumping into a wall all the time.
They are precisely a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," said Wasjunik
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
Both country hosts limp in the road map for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
If necessary, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we must work at maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After many scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There would be a serious danger that the PZPN would not be able to operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer from it."
Numerous members of the first division were sentenced only last season for manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid rebukes outraged
He wanted to promote a new movie, in the interview he talked about the private and now he has problems with the former: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams of anger and rebukes.
The late-war of the Roses for the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now dispute with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time commented on the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful" .
The scope of the betrayals would have come to you only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripper" was the work with Ryan's press for her new movie "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear of undoing: it would be "unheard of," said fifty-four years old at the "New York Daily News," that "Meg once again repeat and rework the history of our relationship."
It would also be "deploring" that to Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child" .
While the Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon becomes father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing everything for the best."
Prices for plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express travels.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6,9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, which would have led to a "warm desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to the prices of the flights the trend in the first trimester still marks up:
As a result of the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul intensive fuel flights would be up to 29.2% cheaper
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class air tickets dropped by 12.5% on average compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business, however, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6%.
As far as domestic German flights are concerned, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices is economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
Sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high figure of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a leading player.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the player of the national Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came in late first and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was precisely formulated, he passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in place.
Rieger has been a physical therapist of HSV for almost 3 decades, he enjoys an even greater esteem than some old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today not everything was nice to see here," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "moved more relaxed."
For the 1-zero Hamburgers have to thank the Mladen Petric (11)'s head shot and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The SV in Hamburg will turn 121 this Monday.
The viewers have already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the blinking ranking on the videoscreen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can fix everything," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling, that the provisional certificate from table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals engaged late - the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric port as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern - finds itself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol re-launches.
After the vote was defeated
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the rescue package's failure temporarily brought down the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the greatest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fast freezing fuel pipes, death by freezing is now upon her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion - the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/swiss in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What amazes scholars for years: rockets do not behave entirely as expected according to the law on gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, he tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could be very close to Earth," he writes.
About the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only been aware for about 10 years.
From her comes evidently a force of attraction, whose effect on other celestial bodies is shown.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations dark matter constitutes at least one fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a pre-liberation shooting, 6 kidnappers were found to have been killed.
In southern Egypt five Germans were kidnapped.
The negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has been reported in agreement with the Egyptian state television, the Arab channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting that took place before the hostages were released is still unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It would have been "still just to take over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers with gunshots and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom from Germany of EUR 6 million; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported with reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom payment.
The men should have been detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by stepfather led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and blindfolded her before having sex while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead" and that she had "drop with life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending: "I tied her up and blindfolded her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended before the court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise she was clearly likely to have been a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The officer of the Cabinet Office who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The papers were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They must have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces of Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government gave £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking saver money, including 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) Director General Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will grow in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will grow in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have acted prudently are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it's unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently in the market on the rise of homes are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We must examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice higher.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra fivepence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pennies in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Denied bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant you a bail for extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many accusations of corruption we are leaning against you.
The long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected for the next few weeks but her party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give her first full freedom.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for oral medical treatment, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he's gonna appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The high court refused to apply for a bail for Sheikh Hasina arguing that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on parole for medical treatment," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall lodge an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Expected the return home of Sheikh Hasina after October 17, said Sunday a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was held last year after the government flanked the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghanistan's anti-polio countryside
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN ran a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Mullah and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV raises doubts about ITV's independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasable and a disproportionate remedy - especially as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the inspector-general of the Department of Justice critical of the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious accusations concerning potentially criminal behaviors have not been fully investigated or ascertained," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the lawyers who had been fired had not been evaluated as being more cheap than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against high-profile republican members of Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm of dismissals, and eventually settled his position.
A number of other officials in the Justice Department quit.
(The inspector-general's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in dismissals, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit track.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's prizes, being on the list of nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocalism that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapse on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other sleepers, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran and long-time resident taxi drivers find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street - without making the Second Road - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy way.
There's no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long - standing neighbors who say they were hit by the cut off road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which is in control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There might be proposals to fix it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seating, including some to use for a café to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover photo set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity - a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow street without exit, dark even during the day and bordered doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with shutters, with weeks old newspapers flying along the slums."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran smoothly across the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lies next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: Immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of California's studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, "which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classes of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth graders, one surprising 100 percent of the students took the top level test in the 2008 math status exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth grade students took the experienced art-language-English test.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the type "no excuses."
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to find out what it was."
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own continuous support for bilingual education prevent us from predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should carefully consider the educational patterns that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
The futures of crude oil fell 7 percent up to $99.80 a barrel to the New York merchant exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had collapsed to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the background of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after congress leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news has been obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the hectic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape infection.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by around 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday unfold, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the threatening clouds that dominated them with a weak game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense hit the Cardinals Kurt Warner quarterback heavily.
The Darrelle Revis cornerback intercepted a stray launch and raised it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another ride and intercepted him.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a fumble of Warner.
The last shift, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe its madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 points unanswered in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third one" .
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested exceeds his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon player ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 miles race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favorably flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie developed the 26th world record of such an amazing career that it produced a world championship or world record at any distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect condition - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half the cross-country skiers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya went long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had cramps in her calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the eastern African rival of Ethiopia - for having overly orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on the opener as if it were a mid-bottom race, and placing the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathonist.
With the step of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the opener vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final jump to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she recovered to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a great gap, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and trials of a black life
Hidden in the theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prisons."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifetime resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power taking and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the southern blacks - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside the Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenery from black history and human drama
Low as a bass drum in life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that suits the passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second weddings and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it what it was like," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston captures by quoting men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a vibrant eccentric who frequently returned from his family who moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston came into the city, he usually arrived without warning in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were grinning.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, swinging in his chair on the patio on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaqueless grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950 ' s, the battle over racial mix brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that one once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and endangers the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you were hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with joyful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the Hurston tomb without a plaque and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's acclaimed Hurston biography hit the bookshelves and re-introduced it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had again turned the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the memorial.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the road.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what one would call high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image that the city has of itself.
Those from outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookcase (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they have just entered here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' " said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stalls and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't know they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nesting bees over their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers monopolizing New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
The messengers shake metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken ironed shirts hung on a stick on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned this so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch office, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order cheques, tourists ask directions for the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my "banker of trust," were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they commute, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrift (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The clerks and clerks standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe harbor, the bank asking for more bonds on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated Director General Dick Fuld in complete familiarity, as if complaining of a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the wardrobe in uniform, almost 50 years old in my condo, has changed the subject with respect to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Desecrated Muslim tombs while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals like street signs representing mosques with a red line passing through.
The police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives led by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile embarked on a spiritual research trip following its right-hand turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final gathering in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicating that the change was brought into predominance by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I'm a foreign traveler who's banned from Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they controlled him that they wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with proof of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at the court hearing at Ashford in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Pretura, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of sexually convicted persons.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police seven days' notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to discuss Glitter's individual cases or possible movements to the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting residents of Kent is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
Eventually he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there as his lawyer David Corker went to the court in Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to enter him in the register of sexually convicted persons.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
One source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor volants nor first clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of capturing the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, feature in this selection of about seventy artists portraits.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate them for a moment in their lives, this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters that sometimes you don't even know or that only allow you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a hazard" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize to be the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" by Dickens, filled the seats of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience whose time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined way" to compensate for the "lack of inspiration," with an intense work of documentation, drafting and continuous reconstruction; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa emphasized, arguing that, on the contrary, it "has effects" and that it "makes people more non-conformist." For this reason he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of the bullfighters that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfighters had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has become fierce against this Festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the development of the second bullfighter.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblanco, were on the billboard.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having done with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the bullfight itself.
The worst of them all was El Juli, passing through the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mulet, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the roadblock in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers inform the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they're on the run.
Officers told the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they went on the run.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1 at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in breach of orders, accelerated abruptly and passed the checkpoint.
The agents went in pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The agents of Ertzaintza were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and to seize the 2,178 kilograms of hash that they carried and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish breads, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since officials have established that the freshman had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that contained in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged with the offence of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
Inmate A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a Californian street spokesman.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "squeezed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with rough maneuvers back and forth. Doing reverse, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about the life of Locklear."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and that's why the agents took her to a specialist drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has been cooperative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been discarded from the beginning, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug" .
The Locklear was arrested with suspicion of driving under the effect of some substances not better specified and was locked up in the local prison around 7:00 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was reestablished from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized as a result of an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, has confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to take a decision on the case of the former Councillor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt towards what has been council member on the Seville council until today.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted that this type of investigation we have the maximum transparency."
In the same way he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
Sangre de mayo, Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film in his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood," and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before making a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd medrilegno. The director had accepted it provided that the story of basing on the novel Episodes Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated in its entirety by the Community of Madrid represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "a stunned Spain that erred the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los ghostsmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los sunflowers ciegos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
Garci doesn't expect awards from this movie.
"At first, you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working for prosperity only, and at some point you're just gonna make one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Siviglian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays homage to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
She was a dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this character. It seemed incredible."
She argues: "We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the mariposa" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the serpent" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "La Puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and for this I feel very honoured."
The set-up also includes music composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega's singing, Morón's Pulga y Moi; El Pájaro's percussions, as well as Rafa La Viola's viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been divas all around, and who have always had many fans" .
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and much less considers her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will start today, at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" also closes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Poet Recincasado" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Culture Council of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Three Years of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-Museum and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chhopo de luz," which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Council of Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Recincasado," edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the diffusion of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Yet it cost him a great deal to deliver an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could be better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, due to the fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so devoid of virtue and people remain well to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and defeated lawsuits, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country to which it has cost much to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the highlight of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for uprightness and to have a serious and distant private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try, and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not lack the opportunity not to be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever witnessed.
A bunch of nonsense, that if they were later taken into consideration at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start at the beginning.
Nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that it would go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only size T-shirts 'S' (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, such things are inequitable with respect to the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to take the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected more than 11,000 people.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait for more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in correct order because of the chip that, I suppose not correctly recorded the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not get into my thoughts.
So I think we're gonna keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group attendees into conversational groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be available shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - hey! Steve, it will be for "the least."
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra."
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time surfing the net than in a remote window environment.
What are half the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They are in desperate need of it, in fact, and I bring back a small example here.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees, at Redmond, earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign prompts them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the Internet.
Last week, moreover, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 jointly.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalising.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the star's apparitions, we can evoke the image of the force with the pointed mustache lifting the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tanks."
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate garments designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature made of her new home, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it gets you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have created my sister Penelope and I for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From which elements does your new Mango collection start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 1950s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything flows together and there are many elements in common.
Since I was little, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to search my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when they give you the wardrobe, it's the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're gonna be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son much happiness and educate him with much love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for a few films filmed last year to come out in the different halls.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago, you made your debut on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, simply called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for his organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we have performed - I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
So much is said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it is to help the women of the Third World, you cannot back down.
Drivers of alcoholism will have to install "Alcocock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
This initiative, in addition to the General Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, will be attended by the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technical Institute for the Safety of the Automobile (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once per DUI then return to drive the car.
Alcoholock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting up if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal proceedings would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE in which it intends to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., second program, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to use as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Navy soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City he threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the hall where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest in the city, a witty reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
The best award offered by fashion
Probably there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and good vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 by Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, together with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, Mango's premier gala table was even more spectacular.
Born, with broken heart and making necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take the breath and arm of his son Luis - a big boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honors of the house and as knight which is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirt - drawn by her hand - transformed for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie."
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us before the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next day we rejoiced for the presence of Olivier Martinez - another big guy moving around in motion - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and making sure before, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the hectic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two ways to combat the exhaustion of everyday life and the difficulty of getting away from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to each taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies such conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off the mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak while they are asleep.
The first time that happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (each day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nocturnal fears, night enuresis (to pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overexcitement situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screaming, shouting, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a vent to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. when coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the baby too much before I go to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is hard to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleeping pills appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you will interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping, so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety comes from in the child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to do an interrogation to get information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming to say, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell the child you could ask him questions at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like that is causing a lot of anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellow created the greatest number of net occasions by turning one into the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to win and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain top and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first net for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, it resumed a rejected ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunman of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, back just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of play when, after an action rocambolesca, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of the fishermen who brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to accept it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that it will "present itself with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that takes place just at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee," created by the Breton fishermen in order to adopt measures to cope with the rise in the price of diesel oil, which reached its record with an average of more than 1,14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make safe the working conditions and the pay of sailors."
The fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy standing still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
Also the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but the connections with Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A road block has been implemented on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning, from dawn on, tyres and vanes in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the pier, or Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the block of the famous Total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not give up" and "are not going to move to Paris," he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also greeted the legend of cinema and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the threat of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world-wide company in the sector, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, re-established by the US monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the successful loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, it specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the IGA met on Sunday evening to consider any disposals, according to France Télécom.
No confirmation was obtained at the IGA.
The assets that the AIG intends to sell include the International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, France Télécom continues.
The IGA must quickly obtain liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historical collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives voted against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, or a drop that had never been seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365,45, down 777,68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) in excess of that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Bags following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1.983.73, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1.106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans out of three rejected the plan.
"It is a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be passed quickly to the Fed - Federal Reserve - (the U.S. central bank, ndr) and the other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economy at Global Insight.
"Every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets "are not only faced with an American crisis but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the Treasury bonds with a 10-year maturity has fallen to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the one with a 30-year maturity is 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama ahead of the first TV duel
After Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the fall in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives a five-point advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has taken the lead.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them considered Obama to be the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his list partner Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has a good intuition," however, he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the topics dealt with during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that," he has often said on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and expertise to become president," he assured.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," this weekend retorted a democratic commercial, reproaching the Republican for not having taken the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced yesterday Obama, in front of 20 000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an electoral meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," he considered, yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's intuition on economic matters with that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the whispers of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for its part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates dodged questions focused on the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents manifested Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the polling stations in the Central Square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislative.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some people confess that they didn't even vote: "What's the point? They'll do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to embark on a democratic turning point.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote," lamented Jouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
" It's a change of façade," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, as the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "it is necessary to initiate dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the 'European Security and Cooperation Organisation' which followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the ballot.
He stressed that participation quotas seemed too high, and that the generalisation of voting in advance (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) gave rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asked social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there must have been at most five members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient in power."
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission welcome their success.
Meeting - Blood is sure again
The Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as the Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of the infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee to design a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Québec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still trusted the donation system in Québec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collection and field research over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had already trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary is nevertheless convinced that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely didn't know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
One was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when one has doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, is taken measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years now, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This incident has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood through our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and of not being able to identify them has thus decreased significantly.
These improvements have considerably reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving infected blood from the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that you will need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is found.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted in blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to having safe resources, the Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
"The needs increase as the population grows older.
As treatment for aggressive cancer, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average represents only 3% of the inhabitants of Québec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they grow older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold it and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it's hard to find an hour to give blood," said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of USD 297 million, the Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, ocular cardiac valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for serious burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public bank of cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousandth cordon blood sample and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of collecting cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to them," as Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Calcium - The Impact in the semi-final
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinals of the A Series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first match of the return, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, took two steps, and picked up a step for victory, in the fourth of Hab's preparatory games.
The only net signed by Kovalev was decided for victory.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to make myself comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest Point to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the conclusion of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to be elected during today's partial elections.
"Amplifying the borders of our last great north border": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mulino a immagini."
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Big means like in the middle of the electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister has, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential," but he has not spoken about timing or investment shares, as he has not explained what the precise priorities will be in carrying out future projects.
At the most, it has merely pointed out what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains" nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds."
That "land twice the size of France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national myth founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he indicated.
Moreover," considering climate change, the North needs to be re-evaluated," he said, referring to the northwest passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit ?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this issue and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ d'ungava), have already launched consultation of some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, on which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) is an important member, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, orderly and respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Central Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another conservative reference was made to John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" programme from 1957 to 1963.
Facing the project related to the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest has specified that its commissioning would be previewed for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will succeed," he confessed to his militants, stirring up heard applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said there would be no elections in April 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not reject the possibility of launching a ballot in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, especially on a federal council mission in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smooth as oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the Northern Plan was received in a sceptical manner.
FP leader Pauline Marois dusted up Quebec's Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so," we would have progressed today," commented Marois alongside the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutinio happened today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, who has returned just today from the holidays.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its own citizen in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not consider at all the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the events accused of him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the accused's guilt.
For information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar, in particular, call for Omar Khadra's repatriation so that he can be subject to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," a word that Harper does not stop flaunting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no morale anymore: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now minority (to see what will happen after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtues, the respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here lies the shame, Mr. Toews, in renouncing all of this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the largest aurifera company in the world has filed a suit for defamation of six million against three authors and a small publisher with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a large amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight against an army of lawyers financed from the pockets practically without fund of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequally-armed struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gags the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to decide again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, it is in public opinion that she would have to present her own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada usually take place with the exchange of views and not with batons.
It would therefore have been sufficient for society to open its books, its documents, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much faith in public opinion and misrepresents petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his disdain for that same audience is clearly evident?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only indicates the highly paid lawyers and not the Canadians as a whole; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Canada Nero does it first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to the Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of gag (searching for the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum ordering them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal discourse, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on university research freedom and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the richest businesses in the world, and many lawsuits, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following scientific standards like the authors of Black Canada.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, just as the public debate in Canada itself is affected, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic deployment, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue-financing plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been hanging on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses foreclosed for failure to pay payments, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to managers of protected companies.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, inestimable disappointments and disturbances would have poured into the daily lives of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time allowed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations later, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential elections were rather in favour of the agreement, without, however, avoiding expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added a number of provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will allow owners to maintain their domicile and that relating to remuneration for managers of undertakings covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the screen of the American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it is something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money doubtful credits, assets at risk and unsold by US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (muti), and then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the heeling of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge who blew up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats agreed that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty will only be protected by the government rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that, if the government were to cope with losses over the next five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which 100 billion more can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will benefit him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the foreclosure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and the departure allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic side.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, addressing his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But don't take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group in the Congress nicknamed "the caucus of the skeptics," democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for € 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would renounce the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for the crisis of the property loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not money lost, said the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights in banking matters are collected.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announcing uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British Government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the balance of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the current loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that you will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Beauty with blue eyes was for a long time its ace in the sleeve, for others its weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years ago.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spokesperson of freedom and development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed couples often produce magic children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last quality mark.
Since he recognized a whole country in love with the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the car driver who classified second to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of a private, discreet, committed star, allergic to show-business scandals, of which the mystery will never be completely unveiled, leave with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the disappearance of Paul Newman was a dive in the heart for the cinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is revived through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that young man unable to desire his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958, are confused in memory.
More recently, we remember him as sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
A lot of other Paul Newmans have gone into history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up there someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute gangster in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
Player of bitter and vindictive billiards in Lo Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face over the years, it was hers.
Him again.
Epochs happen through his path.
The young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry hit by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the graduating movie legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its lavish, festivities and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, described it, with a bit of irony, as "a living challenge to underplaying," judging its performance to be exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall as manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the emarginate to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, carrion or desperate alcoholics, of whom he expressed drooling and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, 1968 (based on the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, he drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they had performed together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the deceased actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift, is extinguished.
We must have splashed her face on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her as a bad choice, although born as a gag.
However, the revenue from those sales was allocated to his Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star."
Being there was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in Zuschlag's invoice factory & partners?
On 8 October, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from invitations to tender was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the execution of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million guilders, ended up in part in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, announced by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from invitations to tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accused act, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which companies to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to his confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to be forwarded to the competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
A large part of these are the work of István Lados and András
One of the choices of the "journey studies" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyptian Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the club together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Egypt at Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal errors and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they have reported Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the office and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT match of our company were at a wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, there was not even the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the invoice was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
Assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they shockedly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's bill issue practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the survey, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover the employees of the hotel issued only printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as carried out activity the transport goods by road, as is known from the procedure of the Public Prosecutor, activity that was not carried out from the company originally founded for advising of investments.
Also for formal defects - cause invoice format not compliant, false stamp - it has been found that invoices issued in favor of Egypt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyptesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunch there a group of Fiatal Városért Egyptesület, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied to have issued him that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Egyptian Évezredért foundation of nearly 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the accused act, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft has also collaborated with Zuschlag and its partners in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyptesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyptesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
There was no movement of money because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director-general of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded the company documents.
According to Kubatov, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egyptütt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the equivalent was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had received no work.
However, the companies returned to him useful because at the request of co-defendant attorney Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued in the name of the companies to associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The Public Prosecutor considers that Kubatov has pocketed 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the call for competition of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a call for the benefit of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
In order for this not to come out, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the development of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it may also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make scapegoats.
Zuschlag could have been offended for the moment, since his requests to lighten his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrests, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive licitating: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this notorious and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study in Science magazine, men don't want to lag behind in a race like eBay auction, so they're willing to pay even a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while with the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win some money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to lure more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex comes intensively into operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, researchers say that the rise in price is explained by the passing of the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group economists carried out a financial follow-up survey.
In this survey, three groups filed a complaint against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost money in the event of an auction loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Recovering the neurologist hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher stakes than the control group or "against loss."
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact so far explained the phenomena found at the auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to seek medical advice?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary, the number of patients with hepatitis is one hundred thousand, of whom only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The hepatitis definition is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leaks, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to vaccination against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive a pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens deviously destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory test reveals the disease it is worth asking your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus stops the infectious power and can be prevented the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the world's day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by patient associations around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first in a series of researches in which in addition to academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they observed either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "safe" as if "someone cared for them" and "relaxed and were pervaded by peace."
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in the pockets of people and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is still not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not really see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders that was: "We put all the information in a system in the world!"
According to Google's director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?" but software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their internet searches, exactly the words you are looking for are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page they stop interested after the search.
Using the Customized Search launched two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they searched and clicked, then in the long run they will generate much better customized results; on this same logic Recommendations is based on which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - they ask concerned users about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases the counter-reactions of the internet users are caused by the fear felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion in power.
However, one fact is confirmed, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has been perhaps the coordinated action against the paedophiles of Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the page of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
The Internet users concerned with personal rights instead sighed with relief in May when the company - in agreement with the Electronic Legal Protection Association EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even later can Google be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government successfully ripped away almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of research expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but nevertheless failed to obtain individual users' search lists and the entire list of websites and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data whip Google because they believe that thus their intimate sphere and private life are affected by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users appear in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation," as opposed to their rival, Microsoft dismissed as conqueror of the world because of Windows, as much as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always updated and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the keywords repeated most often in recent years, web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all these can insert them in systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries appear automatically stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
In the meantime we read of many exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, gets to know easily with those who spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because he has written a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (for example by starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not intentionally register on community pages not to be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't even wait so much in secret for the moment when Google pulls its claws out.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), advertising space AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause big problems not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development firms.
However, critical observers, alongside all this, find alarming points: the company summit for example completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the company's asylum fee, considered the repeated daily catering to be too expensive, but all this diminishes in view of the fact that in 2006 Google bowed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing Google's books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon be faced with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a given genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled tale of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murderer make the tracks disappear.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the police station of the Borsod region.
Young people have recognized the crime against them, they are currently accused of aiding.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on the loose.
Aiding is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was put into preventive detention on Sunday.
He's a suspect in premeditated multi-murder for profit.
The survey showed that the 23 - year - old man had a big debt to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he deceived his creditor into a Ózd construction site where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the share list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer is the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all interested persons the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion Kronor.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Homeland Finance with a quota of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11th."
The global financial disaster occurred thanks to the American President - La Repubblica accuses - who was not able to compact his party behind a law jammed in a hurry, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing, and the world will subsequently suffer from this.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave out the threat - the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Some states today can still offer a life-saving doughnut to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union exceed their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday have weakened financial institutions achieved more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, like American taxpayers, will have to put their hand on their portfolio to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" must not wave away the EUR 100 billion at once, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money in order to prevent greater damage.
Smart machine mimics hornet flight
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies than to imitate the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
Like bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan the hornets gave the initial strategic inspiration to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic minicar equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of removing all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development.
Important is the role of the bee view, capable of a 300 degree view in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, changes direction immediately turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance manoeuvre, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and inner layer of the protective shield, in which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of wheel steering.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their lifespan is greater than those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantity of the intelligent reaction is important, not data processing or even less the ability to store them.
This robot needs to process some inputs in seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvering data, so it uses only a few dozen Kb memory.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict at Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on the standard vehicles.
Further possibilities of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name of the very expensive child.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts, has been drafted.
Half of the sum is spent in the first step.
In the new agreements that lasted until midnight on Saturday according to the schedule of the eastern coast the leaders of the congress decided the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made some serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives of the United States, according to which he has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson spoke of the outcome of the compromise: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic wagon.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. according to Washington time (at 2 a.m. on Monday according to Central European time), but it did not bring a large increase in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the planned 2008 economic stabilisation law on the programme, after which it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the White House news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and we very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson for the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday of the Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy titles with disproportionate credits behind, of the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expense of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make us find ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their release, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
The limitations of payments will only happen in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Treasury will offer the help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the Ministry acquires within the framework of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the deceased bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors' money is not exaggerated.
To this must be added that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of general administrators - commented the measure the democratic Barney Frank president of the commission responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to acquire a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn money if the economy, and together with it, the bank saved, are back on their feet.
The bill includes that over the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal that has how to return to taxpayers the expected losses deriving from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, not defend taxpayers' dollars - said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

The prices of domestic industrial sales in relation to the previous month increased by only 0,1%.
Prices of domestic sales in the processing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1% compared with July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially the bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical sector.
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the field of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metalworking products, price increases were 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, representing a decisive weight.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increases varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Total prices in the processing industry in the past year rose by 10.2%.

In domestic sales among target groups in the sectors, the largest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer items, prices have risen by 0.3%, in the energy sector and in the subsequent use, prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy sector and subsequent use (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer articles, the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Industrial export sales prices in guilders increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared with 12 months, by 3.9%.
The Hungarian guilder has weakened in a month compared to the euro by 1.7%, compared to the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement could enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic system of entrance and control."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no more entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic's Cross with the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed on Sunday their support for the government plan of 700 billion dollars for the rescue of the banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to release the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls with the focus of economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the republican convention with the appointment of vice president of Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the congress would quickly approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those steps of consumer protection which he also supported.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let go of calling McCain's economic ideas out of date.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that "we will all be difficult to bring down this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a viable way."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a supervisory committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters became more self-aware - analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the black-red coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 at the time of the aforementioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernisation in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they made a long mistake, but the secularization, the results of education, the installation of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the electorate's loyalty to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Here CSU support has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition matters" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalitions.
Elections have been made, now they revolve around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV, party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted prudently to the red offerings.
As you said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, leader of the BZÖ, repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the black-red coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, in her message to the Plenum as the main rapporteur of the Congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Mr Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Parliamentary Group, pointed out, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma were first excluded from the labour market because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma are not entitled to study at average level and as a result of poor quality primary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher degree of study."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
She felt that these links should be made more aware in the wider context of Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The Roma's right to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and secreted schools" - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member, the European Union's objective and action union is needed to speed up the process of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, we must give the Roma children the opportunities provided by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe," asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, from the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at State and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the troubled Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, at the top of the Bavarian CSU was for the moment postponed the discussion of personal matters.
The chairman of the Erwin Huber party and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians made it known in any case that they were not attacked with all their strength to the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the Bavarian tsunami claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region are always important for the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced to join forces.
As the first signal of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the restricted exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the Liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors representing right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard from the great ambitions.
The CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role to play, which has been plotting in the shadows so far. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the gall towards the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established by common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of land in the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
Certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the elections on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the fraud committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people of a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change in the 2006 elections held in the circumstances discussed, would "grant" some seats in Parliament to opposition representatives.
The ODS has thus renounced a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the opposition's expectations there was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has requested credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE, when considering the election campaign, put emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as a ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid Monday report also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press in practice, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on the map, considers the two countries independent already a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "power has been afraid of bringing even one opponent into a parliament without weight."
The opposition does not include any protest actions for the results, but rather tries to get the voters to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the officially more assisted class, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in the economic deficit it is only a matter of time for the disintegration of social security "remembering the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, President of the Community Independent States, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on this new measure against the smarties, against the stampers and then goes to drink coffee at the bar on working hours.
The antifanulloni news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," the minister said.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all" .
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione
In Rome, the minister then announced that "in three months the sick leave of civil servants has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined forces to challenge the norms of the decree Brunetta adhering to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Function today announces numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to causes of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'working idlers' is constantly growing.
Thousands in fact in Italy are the employees of the correct and productive public administration that have joined to declare war to the illegitimate norms contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will dispute the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmity dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time slots of the sick worker, within which the checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 people remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the deaths compared to the murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "living appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public" .
"Of course, a 'sufficient' indignant has been raised, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, because of their size, provoke the clamour of the media and the involvement of the public, but everyday reality presents us with dramatic and even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the many initiatives promoted at school for a more direct awareness by young people in the world of work.
Attention should be paid to the phenomenon, not to be alarmed about its social gravity, to implement and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a firm commitment aimed at putting an urgent end to it" .
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"In fact, we would not want this "downward trend" to turn into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is loosening that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workers, and this beginning from the world of the school."
"It needs an additional effort - it has added - regarding the communication and the awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, employers need a greater sense of responsibility for a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for the victims of work" and the "benefit derivation towards which the system is pushing in recent years."
"The goal therefore is to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are in luck should not depend on spontaneousness or generosity from time to time arranged by the legislator."
Mp3 readers accused, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a press release published in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identifyed Health Risks (Crsseri) published today.
"This scientific opinion shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day, keeping the apparatus at high volume, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-hearing mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"There is a clear risk from the scientific findings," continues the EU manager, "and we must react quickly.
What is more, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increased number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit much of this damage by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be raised.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital," which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bill" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - he emphasizes Alemanno - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of Rome's development, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to avail themselves.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
All too often, politics is overwhelmed by the management of the daily newspaper and the emergencies that from time to time are lacking.
On the contrary, we want to look farther and farther, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a wheelchair: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that expresses the Capital."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic drawing of reference, not closed nor immobile, in order to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking in a united spirit of its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome points out, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries alone but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants to pass as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big nerve: he believes that he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
One side of the American mindset comes out covered to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick in the butt.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet Iraq for the majority was Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to perform.
Usa, economic collapse also makes itself felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "murder" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the hall where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the U.S. journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national dailyism is following a wrong path.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a door to the internet, for many views as the "murderer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "it will do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who direct newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job security."
Executives who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters we go to 30%.
That of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it," take it or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can earn even $10,000 a month, in addition to the pension and payment of insurance.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to reach 15 days overall after a number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAURANT TO GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the motion of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation of the counter pact related to the climb Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of his trial, last week, he obtained the release from the housekeepers transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel from the provincial town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which he gave the opposite opinion the pm) would allow him to influence his company and to access the evidence accusing him.
The Elite in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms this by informing us that the current crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the States of the Centre and the South.
The soul, in fact, which has become powerfully alive with the vow of which I said at the beginning.
However, this just mentioned is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps announces or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-Sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have close ties with foreign countries, but which first of all see very much involved the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or not to have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which, as usual, divided between different interests and between different state strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the straits it is only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back together.
They also possess the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization can ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the statue-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the net, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to reckon to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are the water, the crops, the oil.
All things that, look a bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are however absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So those who are sovereign of it certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, however, that foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who can take hold of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaders, especially economic ones, proved to be so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insuffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of countries of the West.
In other words, there seems to be more and more the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have done their time and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanally feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolt" electoral or in the sudden turns of collective moods of these last and very recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, they are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep strata of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, potentially agitates to an extent.
In the face of all this, speaking of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not at all.
The superglue to walk on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimetres, scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY - The American magazine Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glazed paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it easily detachs itself from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of Dayton University.
CAMMINARE SUI MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University, California, is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article in the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a microfibre sticker as self-cleaning hair from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving medicines alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, canceling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already on trial because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
RISK FARMS - The Italian Agency itself reported this in a newsletter two years ago, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national drugs that eventually ensure to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is anything that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," said the expert at the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neokeynesian professor at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days when Enron failed, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that triggered not a few polemics and that for years was reproached to the economist, but that has now proved correct.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "Economist of great value" but also a popularist with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem is overseeing, the new Open Office shows the general public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised interface and made less Spartan, others are added more substantial such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention is also placed to interoperability with the Office Suite 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text computer.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the computer of texts, each color is assigned to the commentaries for better recognizability in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The English version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version of the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the diffusion in the homes, it is precisely in the business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, being already able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the figure expected.
Kohl is also positive in the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the top climber jersey.
The news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will face the two years of disqualification canonical.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of his positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRATI:NEW YORK TIMES ASK YOU, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly received.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what is being asked in a long article the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the North League."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of the caro-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that the families of origin should bear - explains the head of the office of studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market that it triggers a process of generalized increase also for the residents."
In most cases, the lease offers also contain a number of infringements: free contracts, unregistered, with no fee limit, linked sub-rentals.
For the Sunia extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax, can calm the prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, you need about 450 euros; for a single room you range from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari needs 250/350 euros for a single bed, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city's economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students, as in Perugia, is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee applied to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Paradise cinema, cities cancel historic rooms
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multi-sales and the consequent death by the consumption of mono-sales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
It is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and so many emotions were missing," observes the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar prize and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema maybe forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and to pay for the greater heat are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinema monosala lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec," it is useful that new structures are built but it should be ensured the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funds for exhibitors: the government's previous debt is about €10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules provided there are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for parking and in some parking spaces.
"It's an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore,"and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today the audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise," which I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or Quirinale in via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by dust I turn to the other side."
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the City's choices with the interests of the cosca Piromalli."
The accusations that the judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by association for criminals of the mafia, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In disregard of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially inside the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and direction of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that there are many "collusions between local authorities and organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cosca.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, the local politicians had been relieved from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of UoC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the ballot of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned everything for a political question, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the cosca Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a wider group known to be close to the Piromalli, uniting the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca."
When the energy comes from the waves now the bigs fall into the field
It is an exterminated deposit, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for now a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmental demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by ocean wave power plants.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the understanding was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, betting on marine energy is getting more and more and among these companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil giant at the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper - and is considering cooperating with us."
This cooperation concerns obtaining a permit from the US Committee on Energy, which is necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is not a small sign, especially considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to walk the road of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its early days, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, installations such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure spins a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type in the process of design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves at this moment the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others overlooking the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
