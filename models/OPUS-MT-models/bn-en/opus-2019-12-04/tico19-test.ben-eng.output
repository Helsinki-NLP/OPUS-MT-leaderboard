The combination of Corinavirus from the European Union / European Economic Region and the United Kingdom is rapidly increasing from January 1st to March 200 (ISOID-19).
The combination of Corinavirus (ISOID-19) shows the same trend between the European Union / European economic regions and the UK that still depends on the country, despite the fact that all countries have the right to progress.
Based on the knowledge received from Italy, the patient who need medical care and special care needs to be rushed to the country, hospitals and Intensive Care Union.
On December 31, 2011, a wave of unreported diseases were reported in Uhan city in China's Hui province.
On January 29, 2012, the China Coordination and Prevention Center reported that Novell Corinavirus is now referred to as a critical spring-related syndrome Corn2 (SSTS-CoV-2).
So, the SARS-CoV2 case resulted in the illness of Corinavirus (SUSID-19).
So far, the concrete information is that there are 80% of the victims who are underreported, which means the experience of breathing, including neumonia, or without them, and most of them wake up to recovery.
Among the 14% of the victims, the hash ID-19 has become more serious diseases that need a hospital, while 6% of the cases are facing serious illness that needs to be intensive.
The death rate of a patient in hospital due to a halt ID-19 is about 4%.
In this study we explore the trends of each European Union / European Economic Regional (EU / EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare the events with the Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of victims of the EU / EA and the UK, with the current number of victims on January 31- March 15, 2012.
OS / EA Country and UK event ID-19
China's western fictitious ID-19 has gone viral, and the rest of the world is currently following the flow of fallout ID-19 in the country.
The director of the World Health Organization (WHO) General 1E declared it as a luxury of ID-19 in March 20.
In order to mark the 55th March in Euroselance 200, Sputi and his companions reported on the first European-confirmed CID-19 case, according to the case of WHO.
On EU / EA, the first three people back from Uhan, China, were told on January 24 by France on January 20, 2012, about the attack on the first three people back from Uhan province in China.
As of March 19 to 202, all 300 EU / EA were caught in the country and the UK (UK), where the story of 33,78,789 cases and 1,722 deaths have been reported between December 29, 2012, and only in Italy.
Incremental number of victims in COVER ID-19 and Captured maps
On the European Program Against Disease and Control Center (ECC), only the country's health ministry, national and regional health authorities, and HHO, were updated every day on the government source of government-funded information from every country, including the government's source:
This information has been used to compare the quality of the ID-19 of the ECU / EA and the United Kingdom and what happened in Italy.
As a proxy to the problem of the active Symbols ID-1, we've calculated the rise of 14 days of increasing events on 14 days, as well as every EU / EA in every country and the UK on January 1-15, 2012, the natural speed of the calendar.
We also present the chronological numbers of every country's informative cases until March 1, 0: 00, and compared them to Italian spies during the March 15-195 period.
EU / EA Country and UK trends in ECID-19
A 14-day summary of developments in the EU / EA countries and the UK is typically followed by the Chinese state (in China).
For the UK / EU / EA and the rest of the world, the ongoing event started to rise around February 21-19 and then increased to a sharp increase in February 2201.
It was mainly powered by the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU / EA countries and the United Kingdom has shown the same trend in the growth of ID-19.
The image compares Italy to the total number of events in the EU / EA country and the United Kingdom for the period of March 2, 15, 2015.
It is interesting to see that March 15, until 8: 00 AM, another 159 EU / EA country / and the UK have already reported only three weeks ago or less about Italy's total number of victims.
Our results suggest that the number of unknown victims of the male identity ID-19 have increased rapidly in the EU / EA and the United Kingdom.
The irony of the hash ID-19 phenomenon indicates that the plague is moving relatively fast in all countries.
Despite the reactions of national public health, and the fact that the victims are likely to have different definition of different definition and patients in the countries, despite the fact that they need to test a 19th test for what they are going up-up testing.
At the beginning of March 200, medical practitioners in Italian have described a situation in which 10% of the infected patients in the country need neurous care (intensive care) and media sources indicate that hospitals and interactive care units have already reached their highest power.
The information of hospitals and a intrepid service unit is now available only for 6% and 1% of the victims at the EU / EA level.
However, they should be collected in the system to match current surveillance information that focus on the number of cases and deaths.
A study that edited in 20110-11 on Portugal, Germany, shows a huge difference between the value of an intensive care and the availability of intermediate care Bay in Europe.
This means that the countries may have less than Italy or more than 1,000 people (12.5 Intensive care and Intermediate care) per 1,000 people.
With the quality of the ID-1-9 case in every EU / EA hospital in the UK and the United Kingdom, the conditions related to health care services have seen that there is a 90% risk to reduce access to intensive care services and that the CIA has been quick to pay an update.
Since the events are still available in several parts of the EU / EA and the United Kingdom, and the hospital and Intensive Care Unit usually provides public access to a specific regional service user, so the statistics on the victims and intensive care level (NUT2) are available for regional units.
The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the Star ID-1-9 Twummer EU / EA and the United Kingdom are making progress.
So the country, hospitals, hospitals and intensive care units, needs health care and special care, such as the loss of Italy, should increase the number of patients.
As the recent ECC's immediate risk costs, it is necessary to delay the spread of contacts like SSTS-COV - 2, East and All-sustainability, to change the violence from repression, as long as it is expected to increase the numbers and delays in advance of time.
The public health system also lists public health measures to reduce the rapid risks of the outbreak.
There is a short time of opportunity that the country has a chance to reduce the SSTS-CoV and reduce the pressure on health services.
In failure to do so, there is a possibility that health care systems in other EU / EA countries will face increasing numbers of patients in the next few days or weeks.
The Coonavirus Di209 (SARS-CV-2), which was reported to have been in the city of Sivia, has killed more than 300,000 people in China and the rest of the world, and more than 80,000 people have been involved in a disaster of humanity.
SSTS-CoVV is similar to its communal virus, created by thousands of people in 2005, could infect from SARS-CoVV-2s and the same pattern.
However, the intensity of the URI-19 and the death of SARS is less than a matter of interest and attacks men compared to elderly and young people and women.
In response to the growing number of publications regarding the spread of diseases, the article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapid development of research.
We will include primary issues about the disease, the H1N1, vitology, disease, treatment, disease direction and resistance.
Although many questions are still needed, we hope that this review will help understand and achieve the disease.
The spring festival, which took place on January 25, 2014, has become an unprecedented and unique memory to all Chinese people, who have been told to stay in the house for the whole weekend due to the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus was reported to be a high-profile version of Coronavirus (CoV), which in 2005 caused a severe spring-related syndrome (SARS); so on February 21, 2012, the World Health Organization (HO) was named SARV-1 disease and a disease (SAV).
The tsunami started in China and quickly spread across the country and more than 555 countries around the world.
As of March 2, there were more than 8000 confirmed cases due to the virus, including over 30,000 patients and more than 3,000 patients.
"WHO warned that the string ID-19 is" enemy of the number 1 "and is perhaps more powerful than terrorism."
According to Pubimed (https: / / www.www.bccc.nnnm.gv / pbb0v / etc), less than two months since the first report on January 200, the virus has been reported on the virus, Ademiology, H1N1, disease, and medical cases that have been transmitted from the disease.
In this edition, research initiatives are trying to summarize the development of new and rapid growth.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare the URI-1-9-SARS with another CoV-production disease, the Middle East Spring Syndrome (MERS, 2011).
We have discussed what we have learned so far about the prevention and predicament and the rest of it and the urgent questions.
CoV-s are traditionally considered as a Catholic, not fatal for people, which creates 15% of the normal cold.
Of course, in this century, we have encountered twice the human chain of human disease, which has started a massive outbreak in China in 2003 and 2012, and has soon spread to many other countries about the deadly diseases and deaths.
So, the current Copenhagen ID-1 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in the image 1,1, the sources of nemosonia were unknown from Uhan on December 31, 2011, were first reported to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, CovV's sequences were published.
On January 15, 2014, Wu's first deadly incident was reported.
Meanwhile, the outbreak quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 2014, health care providers were reported to have been reported, which indicated that people could be able to travel from the people.
On January 23, Uhan was blocked and closed down all the public transportation.
On January 24, the first Nidanik study of the disease said that 41 patients were directly contacted by Uhan Siet (Sea Food) markets, among other patients, only as a destination for reporting from the source of 21 unknown animals.
On January 30, the Hoo outbreak was announced as a state of emergency around the world.
Until the time of the report, the disease has already spread to nearly 54 countries in China and other countries around the world (image 2).
The situation is quickly evolving, and the ultimate extent of the outbreak is to be determined and exaggerated.
On February 1, 2014, 4,01 confirmed patients, including the ID-1-9 confirmed patient, presented the following image (http: / / mpix.q.q.q.q.s / UBX-HHHHHHHH).
SSTS-CoV undermines all ages, but it's mainly 30-65 age.
About 50 years old, less than 20 years old, and only 14 people were less than 10 years old.
compared to SSTS-CoV-2 women (09,7 / 1,000), men are more concerned about men (0.31 / 1,000).
In mainly Hui and around him, there was an outbreak of tear-gases.
5 days (2-9) from the beginning of the Oslo ID-19, it took 5 days to build the disease.
The average field of disease was 48.8 (36.2).
From the beginning of the disease, there were 1.8 days (48.8-13) to death.
The initial breeding number (R0) was 37.7 (95% CI: 3.51-4565), and coordinated R0 was 2.23-482.
The number of people involved in China's spring festival had quickly increased since January 23, 2014, following the huge amount of transportation.
The death rate was 1.44% (95%): 1.11-11% of the patients and 38.6% (5%).
The reason for the three major risks of the hash ID-19 is gender (man), age (CA60) and serious neumonia.
CoV is a utility for the virus that covers St. RNA's unique source of evidence and the size of the virus.
These can be shared in four gardens, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, which is known to be "smuggled" by Alpha-and-CoyV.
The mode key for SSTS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, is bound with his telescope administrator Angeensin-conversion Njim2 (ACE2) and Diopidiel Petiendez 4 (PP4), and then added to Julli.
Viral RA was released in the GNOME Cyclically; after the viral transcriptions, the Gnomic RNA-based Véricé has been formed with the NA-Interventor to help free the virus.
The first Gnomic incident of SSTS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 200.
It was reported that SARS-CoV - 2 - is a new Bitte-CoV with more than 10% proof of the outbreak in Huandian Food Market in Uhan.
SARS-CoVV is more similar than MES-CoVV and SARS-CoVs.
Through the Electric Micro, the SSTS-CoV-2 cockaches were found in the landmark part of Atanium's human breathing area.
It was reported that human ACH2 was a warrant for SSTS-CoV along with SARS-CovV.
However, as far as SSTS-CoV-2's S Protestant objects are bound to SSTS-CoV, which is the real issue that makes the SSTS-CoV a serious deal between patients than SARS-CoV.
Providing SSTS-CoV-2-Rof3b is a unique form of protein, and could also create a form of processor encoded by rf8.
The power of the SSTS-CoV-2 viral disease and prevent IFLNS from publishing; however, there are no well-known Caribbean fields or techniques.
On February 180, 2014, Zun and others reported the Creo-EM structure in a mix of 2.9 percent of the mixed materials including the Jamaica Actor B0ATA.
They found that the open and closed combination of mixed content was met as a diary, and could lock up two EPS pros, which provides evidence for the recognition and reporting of CokV.
In order to stop SSTS-CoV-2, the B0A1 medication could be a therapy target for the test.
Original and center shooter
It is reported that both SAS-CoVV and MERS-CoV have grown from bats and caused human beings to grow through the Sivev cats and camels, respectively.
After comparing SARS-CoV to other coV-2, Bats were considered to be a biologist of SARS-CoviV, as well as the new virus from Bat-SL-CovX45 and BSL-CoVX21.
However, there is still a detailed explanation on the road between the virus that helped the virus to infect the people.
Ji and others that presented the white as a virus among the people from Bat, which is linked to the reincarnation of Homolas in EPS.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China have indicated that the 99th percent of the COV in the CV-Coin between the long-term Chinese pharmaceutical species used in traditional Chinese medicine, ants who have been found in SARS-CoV2 and Penglin are the most likely to be in the CV.
However, the difference between 1% of the two Ziome is still a big difference; so the result is still waiting for concrete evidence (image .33).
The Cco-chemical feature of SSTS-CoV 2 has not yet been known.
In a dry environment outside SSTS-CoV and MERV-CoV, 48 hours and 40% of the temperature and 40% of the PC could live for 5 days.
The SSTS-CoV-2 attribute could be similar.
Reports say that the SSTS-CoV-2 is sensitive in heat and in the heat for about 56 ° C for 30 minutes; Ether, 75% Ithanol, Chroxine acid, Chloroform, and other Floyds can disable the virus.
The entire people are generally lacking the protection of the SES-CoV virus, and therefore they risk being infected by the Novel virus.
No detailed survey of the SSTS-CoV2's unveiling response has been updated.
So, we can only see the previous survey on SARS-CoVV and MERS-CoV (image 4).
Usually, after entering a virus, it was first identified by the replica of the apothecary, like the Réptor of C-type, Répétor (PACR), and Répé Répé (like RTL).
Through various ways, the spread of the virus is publishing the relevant content, and the tone I am Interpol's involvement in the virus, and the online anti-viral artists are quick to expedite the McRoofFacios Pagesos.
However, the N protetin virus at SSTS-CodiV can be saved from the reaction of the virus.
Soon, the anti-virus reaction also joined the fight against the virus.
The T Limphs, including C4 + and C8 + T cells, played an important role in resistance.
The C4 + T cells inspired B cells to produce the virus-specific antibodies, and the C8 + T-cells were killed directly by the virus.
Proprisionary nebulons produce cetinine to help prevent the removal of T Helper cells.
However, the CV can prevent the popularity of TT by provoking the death of KV.
The C3a and C5a and the artists need to fight against the anti-retroviral treatment of Dehoros, including complement and Android.
For example, the recovery patients prevented the MERS-CoVV from being separated from the patient.
On the other hand, the excessive sensitivity of the incantation system creates a number of local free expressions that may cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst of circumstances, many of the organs can even die and die.
As a result of the SARS-CoV-2-2 attack, the elderly and pregnant women are likely to be harmed.
It is common that people who are in large numbers of virus, or whose resistance power is weak are more likely to infect than others.
In Oay, the first 425 victims study is the day of tomorrow 1-14 of the average disease infectious diseases in SNS-CoV-2, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, research on 1,099 victims proved that the diseases (inquires) were up for 3 days and lasted from 0 to 24 days.
According to the above description, a very recent study shows that the orthology of the disease on the population was 48.8 (36.2-72).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time of the most proper disease, which is based on the breeding field, to prevent the virus from being infected by the unchecked people.
As a common ritual, people affected by the virus or by the organization usually need to be in quarantine for 14 days.
Do you need to increase the amount of time to 24 days in the quarterback?
Almost in the case, the fever is the head of the ID-19, with no syndrome, or other sequences like dry, cough, breath-breathing, pain, headache, pain, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, skin, potion, and veal.
A week after the spread of the disease, some patients felt disrespiratory (breathing pain) and / or hijapisia.
In serious cases, the pressure of the patient to spring-spring syndrome, the Sepotic, the Bipandosis and the cells are rapidly developed.
Despite the symptoms of fever and / or extreme respiratory diseases, even Palmary images of patients are not unusual, the virus needs to be tested in primary diseases.
At the end of December 2011, a public study showed that the targets had 98% of the symptoms of fever, 76% of them dry cough, 55% of its diarrators and 3% of the population were diarrans; 8% needed to provide the housing support for the patient.
A wave of a square (family class) and two recent studies about the experience caused by a report from unlocked persons.
relatively, in 2011, a public study was seen as the main order of MERS-CoV patients (98%), dry (47%), and Discrimination (55%).
However, they needed the support of the 80% of the ventilation support, which is more than URI-19 patients, and they are in a series of more than MERS's higher power than ID-19.
The MERS patients have seen diarrations (26%) and pain (21%).
It was proved that the fever (99% - 100%), the dry cough (22%), the disappropriation (40% - 42%), Diyarya (20-25%), and the neck pain (13-25%) were the main lock, and that around 14% of the patients needed assistance.
Between February 14, the death rate of the world was 2% of the ID-1, while confirmed to 666,76.
More than 10% of the confirmed cases were confirmed.
For MERS, the death rate of a public study on June 12, 2011 was 2,494% of the victims.
A previous study was reported that 95% of the 7.7-7-23, including SARS-CoV intervel (CI), which was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison between RERS-CoV and SARA-CoV and SARA-CoV have been presented to the table 1.1-1.
The above numbers indicate that the spread of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV is more powerful than the other two, but it is less lethal.
Therefore, control of SAS-CoV and SARS-CoV are more challenging than SARS-CoV.
The habit of infection is often the same in the same family or the same crowd or the transport of the sea.
In the past two weeks, the patient has a history of visiting or settling places in the area of Uhan or other areas.
However, there are reports that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without a vaccine, and the survivors from the hospital can carry the virus once again, sending a warning to increase the time of Quarantine.
In the initial stage, the patient has a natural or less affordable white blood chain.
For example, between 1,099 patients, the Limphs site is < 1 × 109 / L, the number of white blood cells, including 109 or L, and the rising Eclipse of the Eclipse, and the 109 percent of the non-40 patients.
The blood of some patients and the pineapple levels increased, and the blood of most patients rose to an increase in the face of the C-Triwizard Protestant and the Ares site.
In the case of serious infected patients, the level of D-DM, which was given an increase in blood-based pharmaceutical Processor, and the number of Limpho sites was increasingly injured.
Most of the patients in the ID-19 are found unorthodox, and in the lung, the biodiversity of the foreside is subjective.
The patient is often seen in Syndrome (ARDS) due to the unnoticeable neumonia, severe lung wound and severe spring sickness.
When ARDS happens, uncontrolled prods, liquid liquids, and the progressive Fairuffis have endangered the system.
Type-i-and-type nemoons block unusually functional sequence levels and turn off the surface, causing the growth of lungs and the risk of a weak stomach.
So, the worst kind of hard-looking radiographic search is the trend: the most serious treatment of the disease.
On February 18, 200, 2012, in the Paralympic Analysis of Nemos, Hayelyn Memarenn, Institute of Infiltration, Infiltration of the dead body, and a multi-nuclear syndrome similar to the VAS and RARS complex.
The signing of SSTS-CoV-2 RNA was used as a key ruler for the River-Transterage Polimagee (RT-PCR).
However, due to a very wrong-negative rate, which could attract the harasser, starting on February 13, in China, for the disease (which is not only based on RT-PCR).
The SAS disease has also seen similar situations.
So the history of the disease is essential and necessary to determine effective programs.
On February 14, 2014, Feng Zhang described a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHIT) tactics to determine SCOL-1, which was less than 20 / 10 per hour of the total growth level.
Hopefully, the new tool, if checked by Nidak sample, can be dramatically increased in productivity and productivity.
Due to the lack of experiences in Novell CoVV, other CoV-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Table 2), and other diseases that are used before (2), or as well as the treatment of medical therapists who have been using medical equipment for medical checkID-1000 patients.
In this therapist, anti-retroviral medicine, untouchable reactions include plasma, paralysis, cure patients in China, medicine and psychological assistance in China, and potentially medical treatment.
Even the proposal was given to use plasma from patients who were cured for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are competing against the virus to create antibodies and vaccines.
SSTS-CoV was mainly attacked by lungs at the beginning, and it was likely that it was attacked by a few other organs that were published by ACE2 such as the gas petrochemical system and kidney.
Nevertheless, the disability and misogyiness of the patient is the main cause of threat and death.
In this way, it is essential to the need to reduce the infections and save the lives, and including the general oxygen therapy, high-speed oxygen, tear-up ventilation and segregation of diseases.
The patients of the serious health syndrome should support an Experable Merchant Occiension (ECO), a well-developed carnival biesus technology that is used to treat deadly cartels or respiratory respiratory respiratory diseases.
Moreover, the balance of electricity to the SAS-CoV-2 patients is essential to maintain the balance of electricity, the inequalities and the protection of the defense of the protection of the protection of the protection and medical forces.
It is reported that the situation in Saitokaiin was the result of the excessive reaction between SARS and MERS patients.
The Cytosin disaster is a crucial reaction to the release of the chain of the TNFW, IL-1, IL-6, IFLNET, IFNET, IFLNET, and MCP-1.
These cyclists cause large numbers of anti-disease infections, which are the main reason for the RDS and multiple organ resolutions.
In particular, the reaction to the Sitokaiin's treatment of serious patients is essential.
Corstica Troika and Tsiromerbo, an antique anti-IL6 Molotonal antibody, used for treatment in Cytosin.
Other non-violent responses to the disaster in Sitopaiin include the correction of the T-orbit reaction; IFLN-1, IL-1, and TNF; JK Presmonor; Lindsay; Lindsay, and Deobabababble.
In order to reduce the severe damage, the level of medical care for SSTS was widely used as an evolutionary EmuonPress.
Although high medicine levels were not useful for serious lungs, between SAS and RSS-19 patients.
Instead, these could create serious side reactions, especially the avocatical Otopperoscope, affecting the dramatic potential of healing.
Nevertheless, the medium medicine is advised to use with the discretion of the employees of the Corsticos, the short course of the Corstice Department, as the ID-19 patients.
The issue of antiviral therapy has not been confirmed until writing.
Although, the interns, including Valentine's, have proved to be a responsible for a US patient, including the nuclear trigger Analog, have been proven.
The Revoluciir is a Noville antiviral medicine that was initially developed for treatment for Ebola and Marilberg virus.
Later, we showed the possible resistance to RNA virus, including MERS and SSTS virus.
Based on this, Gellad Chinese provided this young man to run a series of charts on SSTS-CoV-2 infected people and the result is expected.
The Caribbean has been recommended as a potential therapy for the severe spring-related patients, as well as the interface-in-interface, Lofinevy / Rivonnivi and Ribhenin.
A joint therapist through Lopanivi / RENEV can be the reaction of diabetes, vaguely vaguely, vaguely, loss of liva and other hostile reactions.
It needs to be monitored with other patients to take care of the treatment.
Plasma and antibody from a cure patient.
The same disease has a long history of raising blood from patients who are suffering from the disease.
In fact, the patient often has a higher level of antibody due to their blood.
The antioololologelin (Ig) and these are identified by the Catholic militants and directly satisfy them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were saved from the hash ID-19, and 10 of them were diagnosed with serious sick patients.
Their bodies were improved in 24 hours, and they were immediately able to load the load and the involvement of oxygen in blood.
Although, specific therapists have yet to be created and previously need to be verified and wise to propose a system for the long-term use.
In addition, in the context of the medical impact, some problems related to plazama should be considered carefully.
For example, the reaction to the resistance of the antibodies can be more motivated and the release of cynicism could be a deadly poison.
The blood has low density in general, and plazmar has a huge demand for treatment of sick patients.
It is very convenient to quickly develop and create antibodies in a certain stage against the global outbreak.
So, it is more important to identify the genetic orbiting of B cells from the patient and the effective antibodies against the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodi.
For thousands of years, TTM has been used for treatment in China.
However, its impact depends on the combination of multiple components in a large form that has changed based on the disease based on a TM-theory.
Most of the useful content is unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to verify and test the positive combination of these material or tools.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for RFE-19, TTM has become one of the major alternatives for patients from light to serious levels.
For example, it was reported that Xu Feng Jaffi (Shu Feng Je Du) had been useful in the capsule and Huan King Wayne (Taiwan's Huwa Qing Wen).
In many states of China, the TTM was used for treatment of patients with more than 87% of the recovery rate, including Gansu (63.7%), Nangia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, there was a reduced 30% (about 50%).
However, it is a very sensitive comparison because many other factors like the number of patients and the extreme should be included in the price.
On February 28, 18E published a study comparing the treatment of Boli Zang and colleagues to Western drugs (WM) as well as the WM and TM joint treatment.
They saw the temperature coming back to normal levels, from the syndrome and the necessary time to enter hospital only than the WM group and the WM + TM group were very badly, rather than the WM group.
The most interesting of all, the quick decline rate (from light to light) was much less than WM + TM team (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the death rate rate was less than WM + TM team (88%) than WM + 39%.
Despite this, TTM's performance and security is at the highest level and more controlled tests are waiting for more test tests.
The process of action and if possible, the combination of the TTM treatment will be evident.
Most of the patients who are suspected or suspected at the ID-1-9, feel very vulnerable and even the threat of a cure disease, and those in the quarterage feel bored, alone and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of reporting such as fever, hyruia, cough and medical effects, such as the Corsticos Troops, could lead to more anxiety and psychological stress.
At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, different types of chemical syndicates were reported, including long-term, anxiety, panic, chemical attacks, cyostic sequences, distribution, and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of Aceh ID-19, mandatory contraception and Coarenstein can cause more concerns and guilt about the consequences of the stigma of their families and friends.
So, the مصID-19 patients, the suspect and the people who are in touch with them, as well as the need for ordinary people to provide psychological health care.
There should be psychological aid between a series of medical science groups to build mental health groups, about the outbreak of SSTS-CoV and the use of professional electronic equipment and apps to avoid the presence of each other.
The most important and often the antiviral treatment that is needed and often complied with the outbreak caused by the transfusion of animals and sensitive poaching from people to prevent the chain of infection from animals water and contracting sensitive poaching.
A long-term and strong resistance against SSTS-CoV is being attempted to develop or create an internal intervention.
Live-enabled vaccine tests were tested in SARS's animal models.
However, before starting a medical study, the elderly and the deadly-challenge model are still not set up to protect the spread of the virus against people from the source of animals.
This is probably because SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and has not been informed of any new attack.
In contrast, the incident in the Middle East, and the MRS wave, and the existence of Zunotic sources in the affected region has spread to other regions.
The inactive virus, DNA plamide, Vector, NoonParalysis, virus-like and recoline subunit, has been set up for the MRS, and some of them are assessed by the model of animals.
An urgent and important act to control the ongoing guests of SSTS-CoV for non-intrusive people.
However, due to the long-term growth of the vaccine, and the rapid change of CoyV.
As a unique disease, the full nidanik court of RFE-19 has just begun to become the full of thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patients can slowly heal, except for the eastern Roma.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, there is a lot more sickness and death rate for patients who are seriously affected by ala ID-19.
Therefore, for health-service agencies, especially in limited areas, it is essential to create a foresight model for the disease.
Still, based on the Nidakanik poisoning, the following reasons could affect or connect to the speed of the disease of patients (Table 33):
Boy: The most important reason for the SARS disease result was that of the fact that it was not in the context of the URI-19.
The survey above, identified by 8,866 victims, resulted in the ID-19.7% of the victims, mainly 30-65 years old.
At the same time, the potential for survival and complexity of other patients and compared to others (66 years old and 51-year-old age), which signalled the speed of the disease for the victims.
Gender: Men SSTS-CoV-2 has been compared to women (0.31 / 00000 vs. 000000), which is described above.
There are multiple diseases and complications: there are patients who need a fragile service, with a heart attack and a high risk in Arizona.
The cardiac events were also the main reason for the death of SARS patients.
The report also reported that the AC2-positive covV-2 could also be bound to SARS-CoV2, which could result in the negative drought of patients in the country.
It must be remembered that age and heart disease is strictly related and that one can intervene.
Unusual information available in the testing area: the blood-interactive proteins reflects the severe consequences of the attack on the Proah (CRP), and the potential infections of diseases, therapy reactions, and the speed of the final recovery.
A mutual relationship between the ID-19 was proposed with the CRP level.
In addition, the newly launched Blackstate de Hyrogenes (LDH), ESTES ESTICES Transferage (AST), Alanine Eminite Transferage (ALT), and Cristian Kaizénez (CK) could also help predict the consequences.
These fireworks are widely published in multiple formats, especially in heart and agriculture, and during Cokula's loss.
So, these are typical symbols for heart or drought.
The main Nidakanic prefix: For the complexity of the ID-1 and the end of the year, there is also a need to consider the progress in the time of Radioography and Nidanic syndrome.
Stroid's use: The top narrative, to reduce damage, the levels are usually used as circumventive treatment for infectious diseases.
Since the high levels of medicine in Corsticos were used in serious SARS patients, many of the northern tribes are suffering from long-term failure and living conditions, including the lower quality of living.
So, if you need to, use the blankets of the PCID-19 patients and for short time.
The mental pressure: According to the above, many patients often endure long-time queues and uncertainty during the Oslo-10s, and were forced to suffer from the death of family members and patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients get away from mental stress and return to normal life.
Still, according to public studies, the Maharath ID-19 is different from SSAS.
Aside from creating subversive substances in the lower part of Sbasinali, SSTS-CovV-2 basanav can effectively create more efficient copies of the surface, and not extract the basic levels of infection, which are considered like other coV-V-s responsible for the general cold.
So, there is a great problem in the control of the outbreak, at the primary level or the inequator of the disease, that you can produce a large amount of virus during the daily work of the virus.
However, if the patients were sick, the SSTS-Coin was considered to have been the first to report on the issue, when most of the visits did not occur at the first time.
In this way, it is difficult to control the current outbreak of the URI-19 outbreak, compared to the SSTS outbreak.
There is a great effort in China, including the SSTS-CoV-2 to prevent the spread of diseases, among which Uhan and the neighboring cities of Uhan and the vast majority of the population are located.
Although these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new patients is declining, pointing out the slow decline of the volcano.
The most expected assumption is that the disease will end in March and that the lower face episode of the disease will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hanter and others were speculating that the URI ID-19, which is being put to more than SARS, will not end at 200.
Ayra Longini and others set up a model to predict the results of the Mahama, and signifies that the SARS-CoV-2 of the world's two-thirds of the population could be involved in two-thirds of the population.
A Canadian group reported that the new virus would be the same cycle of influx, recovery, and two weeks ago, in the center of the hospital, were identified as the SARS-CoV2, which indicates that the newly-marked virus is likely to be the same cycle of influenza.
However, there is a hopeful hint in China based on the new case, pointing out that the current trick could be working.
The initial estimates suggest that Ebola would create a million victims, including millions of deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been kept under control at the end.
It is possible that such as SARS-CodiV, could be weak in the case of SARS-Coin-2 and finally be destroyed or that it could become a relatively undermined virus for people to live with.
Below is a comparison of SARS and MERS (image 55) in the series of RSD-1.
Cashi or walk and may also be a highly advanced addition to the contaminated content of the virus with direct versions of the SARS-CoV-2.
The virus was also found in the mall, a new possibility of the attack on the face-to-face from the mall.
According to a recent study of 138 victims, the 41% of the cases of the attack were probably due to the incident in Novumial (hospital), including 17 other pre-disease patients and 40 health care providers.
In this way, people, especially health-care workers, family members, colleagues and even patients, or even victims, need to take adequate warning to protect people who are close to them.
In order to reduce the risk of infection, the mask could be used as the first stage of defense; the use of Serbian masks and N95 Spring masks (# 1,80s) managed to control the virus.
The surgical face mask prevents small drops of the body from spreading or blocking the surface of the substance, which could spread to others.
However, only N95 (# 1,880) can protect from small contractors like the month 10 to 80, only 5% of them fully enter; SSTS-CV-2 size is equal to SARS-CV-CV, and both are close to 8m.
Since the particles can even enter through the social mask in five times, health care providers should not be a Serbian mask, N95 (# 1,80s).
Aside from the month of the health service providers' mask to reduce the contact with the virus, the measure should wear the metal modes.
Virus can also infect the person through eyes.
On January 28, 2014, a doctor was involved in SARS-CoyV, although he wore N95 months; the virus may have entered his body through his intestines.
So, health care donors should also wear a transparent face mask or hear while working for patients.
In the areas affected or affected by potential, each one is advised to use their hands with more than usual poisoning soap, try to stay inside the house and limit the contact of the suspected individuals.
People are considered three feet suitable to stay away from a patient.
It is also an effective method to prevent the risk of infection, as well as the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has come as a new virus in the world, China should have high alert on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2005, according to its report on January 7, 200.
However, prior to January 200, the director of the Uhan Program told citizens that the Novel virus is limited to infections and human beings and there is no shortage of control and control of the disease.
The message made public interest significantly, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and wasted significant time to curb the disease in the middle of the minimum level.
China's Disease Control Agency can learn these strict lessons and inevitable development in the future.
For example, these organizations need to be more careful when they publish (1) because every word people will consider it and change its attitude and decisions (2); without being able to get more sensitive information from the clinics or officials, they should be able to respond to the initial implementation of reports; and more sensitive information from the community.
The outbreak of the Novell virus started at the end of December 2011, by SARS-CoV-2.
Within less than two months, it spread across China and it has spread to more than 54 countries around the world during the writing of the report.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CodiV, and the syndrome of the ID-19 and SARS, it has created a feeling of return to SSTS, a outbreak of the outbreak of 0.9.
However, there are some notable differences between ala ID-19 and SARS which is necessary to curb the plague and treat patients.
Zahra ID-19 affects men older than adults and women, and is more than any young man of extreme and dying.
The death rate of SSTS is more than ID-9 (compared to 10.91%).
The virus, on the other hand, is usually a serious illness, so that it is much easier to suppress the SARS-19 infection than SARS.
It automatically explains that compared to SARS-CoyV, SAS-CoV2 has spread faster and more rapidly.
A regular RNA could be negative for some SPS-CoV-2 patients.
On the other hand, healthy patients can be positive about the virus again.
The discovery has increased the risk of spreading the virus dramatically.
The study in Copenhagen ID-19 follows a number of important issues left to be resolved as soon as possible:
Where did SSTS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there are 96% of the SSTS-CoV-2 and two bat-like cocovis found, we can't still reach the conclusion that SSTS-CoV-2 has come from bats.
Which species was the correlation between the virus from the original, such as bats?
Without knowing the answer to # 1 and 2, we can't effectively reduce the spread of information and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although the aturical model and biological sources show that SSTS-CoV-2 is bound to the EA2, how does the virus enter the right corner of the respiratory cells and bring the changes to the next urgency?
Does the virus even lock down the ACE2-TB cells with other organs?
Without the obvious answer to this question, we can't get immediate and proper diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the guests continue?
How is the virus evolving in human relations?
Will it be a global adventure, death like SARS, or a repeat of the outbreak of a heart flu?
It is essential, but the above and more questions need some time to find answers.
However, let's not claim that, as soon as possible, we have no choice but to stop the disaster and take our lives back to normal conditions.
The source of the human coronvirus.
conversion and adaptation have led the evolution of Corinavirus (CoV) and humanity for thousands of years.
The two human coV (HCV) was known as a light illness like the general temple in 2004.
The currency turned his back on the heels of the deadly violent spring syndrome (SARS) and the outbreak of the Spring Syndrome in the Middle East, to reveal how corrupt and deadly the HV infection could be.
In late 199, SARS-CoV, located in Central China, brought the CoV back to the top of the discussion, and it surprised us to show the high level of high-profile and poor diseases compared to our sister SARS-CodiV.
The HCoV report is a animal-borne disease and can help us understand the juantic source of HCoV.
Most of the HCV have been developed from bats where they are vulnerable.
Some HCV-deep shelters have also been reported.
There is a direct impact on the survival of animals.
Investigator CoVs - asylum seekers - may provide important insight into coV diseases among people.
In this edition, we are providing a brief summary of the knowledge about seven HKV, as well as their own animal sources and relevant efforts to discover their history.
In particular, we compare and compare the various HCV-related aspects of the virus and the view of GNOME reconnection.
In this context, the current CoV disease has been discussed in the Philippines (ISOID-19).
Moreover, the need for successful asylum seekers to change and the impact of the outbreak of the virus is also targeted.
Corinavirus (CoV-Warriors) is part of the family, with a group of read-up, positive, non-sensitive, single-scandalous RNA virus.
The virus, called "CoV" because of the crown-national organs, was under the Electric microscope, which provided the largest Gnoom of the RNA virus between 26 and 32 km.
Structure, there is a combination of coV-medials that belong to the same organization.
There are two large overbreaking open reading frames (ORF1b and ORF1b) in almost two third, which are converted into P1,1A and P1b arrests.
Poppletinines are also implemented to produce 162-structure protein protein, named nsp1 16.
There are ORF for constructive protections in the rest of GNOME, including the key (S), mode (E), Julli (M) and Nuppleprotein (N).
Some Liñez-specific Acceleration Projections are also encoded by Liviz CoV.
Based on the difference between Protetin Siquenen (alpha-koV, Bei-kovi, Gamma-kovi, and Delta-Covey), the majority of them have HV, and it is divided into four nests (B, C, C, C, and C).
Nation evidence shows that cats and mice are mostly the source of Alpha-CoV and BT-CoV, while birds are the head of Gamma-CoyV and Delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to cross the interspecies, and several major human diseases have emerged.
Until today, seven human coV has been reported.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are Alpha-CoV.
HCoV-OC43, HCV-HCU1, Cyia's Acute Response Syndrome (SSTS-CV), Minel East Pressell Syndrome Cornón (SAS-CV) and SVS-SV-SV-SV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoVV-HQ1 and HCokV-NL63 usually make light signs like the general and / or Diario.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoVV, and the newly detected SARS-CoVV, the target of intense respiratory respiratory respiratory respiratory respiratory infections (Acute Restrium, ARDS), and the lower risk of infectious diseases are underrepresented outside of the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E train was collected from the noses of the ordinary patients in mid-1960.
Since then, more knowledge was collected through the extensive study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC439, including both self-limitations.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that the visit of HCV was usually innocent.
One of the most recent events in recent history of the SARS outbreak in 2004, which affected over 8,000 people, and the undue death rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the spring syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East has led to the outbreak of the Arab Peninsula and has gone viral in the rest of the world.
The 2011 Novell HCoV (209-NKV), which was later named SSTS-CoVV, has been the coordinator of the Corinavirus in 2019 (RSID-9), has caused more than 300 lives until March 2, and more than 1,000 deaths and more than 1,000 people have been built.
Warning is ringing and the world needs to be ready for the upcoming guests of SARS-CoV.
Each of the seven HCV have the source of animals from bats, mice or landlords.
Multiple evidence support from bats to all the radical sources of the HCoV, where the virus is well-behaved and infected, however, the spread of the fertile genetic diversity.
Verily, the SID-19 outbreak has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Providing a framework for the lack of natural history, carbon power, and the limitations of butterflies from the species.
This can also guide or manage the search for the SIS-CovV, Middle and Composite animal shelters, as well as the most important factors to combat the future's spillover.
In this edition, we present a brief roundup of the HCV-CV animals, transnational relations and diseases.
In particular, we want to reflect on the common issue and discuss that the HCV-CV parents are usually vulnerable to the virus, but after entering the body of the new asylum seekers.
We explore the trends of the HCoV, where the growth of the meetability is often reduced to diseases.
The current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has also been discussed.
The cattle have been known since the end of 1930.
Before the first collecting of the B814 of the HCV-29E Strikes from the nose of the general cold, various coV-related species including Turks, cows, pies, cats and dogs.
In the last ten days, seven HCoV has been identified.
Kalunicum will result in a short and educational information (Table 1) in the history of the HCoV discovery.
The first HCoV-229E train was separated from the breathing track of patients in 196 and was later adrift in the WI-38 lungs line.
HCoV-29E had a headache of patients with headache, anger, illness and silence, and fever and cough were seen in 10% of the cases.
Later in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was collected from the analog culture and later the milk-based rat brain's refinery.
Interactive feature of the HCoV-OC43 report is similar to the symptoms created by HCoV-229E, which can't be actively separated from the symptoms of a virus and other respiratory diseases like the Influenza A virus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are all distributed around the world and they are mainly interacted in winter climate.
Usually, the two virus has less than a week, but there are about 2 weeks of sick illness.
A study by human volunteers shows that health workers in HCoV-2295 have developed a light common population.
Only some non-recreational patients experienced serious low-low spring spring urination.
"SARS," also known as "Acacal Newmonia," was the first love in human history for the HCV and its cause was SARS-CoV, the third-discovered HCV. "
The first case of SARS was found in the late 2000s in China's Guangdong province.
The SAS outbreak has resulted in numerous reports of events across many countries and across the continent, including 744 people dead.
Apart from super-sponsors, it was estimated that the viral lodes could grow up as soon as each case came from 4 to 7 days with the Incuerment Pive and the 10th day of illness.
Patetha, headaches, fever, incomprehensible and cold marks the respiratory effects of respiratory, cough and respiratory respiratory respiratory respiratory respiratory conditions.
Limphpeya, the distorted liver function check and exaggerated, is the usual laboratory of SARS.
The effects of the isolated alvolar damage, the intrigue of the cells, and the aging of the MacFJ patients in SARS.
Nearly 20-30% of the patients need interactive care and technical venues.
In addition to lower spring, multiple organs including gas Troinical tracks, liver and kidney may be infected with these serious incidents, usually a chemical disaster that could pose a serious danger to the environment of non-violent patients.
The virus was first collected from an open lungs by a Hong Kong traveler from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been dedicated to HCV research.
At the end of 2006, a child from the HCoV-NL63 Netherlands was collected from a child in 7 months.
It was primarily between young children, elderly and respectfully sick patients with less access to diseases.
The common disease created by HCoV-NL63 in Coriza, Eye, fever and Bangalore.
Another independent study describes the collection of the same virus from a 8-month-old boy who was attacked in Newmovania in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in Netherlands, it was global.
It is estimated that the HCoV-NL63 normal health disease is estimated to be around 4.7% of the cases in the early winter and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also related to the collective Laterztis, also known as Crows.
In the same year, a 71-year-old man was collected from a man affected by the neumonia and the color of the HCoV-HU1 Hong Kong.
In addition to the communal-earned neumonia and the colorful ortholic, the HCoV-HU1 is known to be involved in severe haystals.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-29E and HCokV-OC43 have been found around the world, due to the delicate disease of spring.
The four-earned HCoV has grown well with all people and it is usually unlikely to turn them into a higher Catholic disease, even though there is an unknown accident, such as HCV-NL63's rare tragedy that has recently been reported in China.
Usually, when these HCoV-capacity to coordinate and maintain themselves, they become relatively harmless or infected.
In 2011, MERS-CoV was the first to be collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who managed to lead to strong neumonia and Renjana's failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases that are confirmed in the lab have emerged from the Middle East, several European countries and Venezuela have been found outside of the case, including the second round of reports of a series of close communication.
In 2010, South Korea witnessed a second-stage outbreak of the 186 confirmed cases.
Nidanik publishers of MERS are similar to SARS, identified by progressive neumonia.
Different from SAS, there were a severe retailment for many patients, which is the second in the case of the HCV production disease.
There are more than 30% of the patients with a stomach disease such as diabetes and vomiting.
In February 14, until 200, more than 250,000 tests confirmed that more than 344% of the deaths have occurred, one of the most deadly virus in MERS-CoV.
At the end of December 2019, the city of Uhan was identified in the city of Hubei, China after a series of events related to the victims of the neumonia patients' SARS-CoV.
The international concern over the ongoing outbreak of low-suffering infection by the World Health Organization SARS-CovV-2 declared an international public health emergency and naming it the disease.
As of March 3 to 200, with approximately 3.4% of death rate, the world has confirmed it.
In particular, death rate is 4.2% in China, but outside of that, 12.2%.
SSTS-CoV-2 provides serious health care issues such as SARS-Cowerage and MERV.
Some patients are also seen in Darya.
One of the most deadly signs in Newmosa and the crisis of intense respiratory conditions could be quickly advanced in Syndrome.
Although 82% of the top nucleid sicoons have been very similar to the SARS-CocoV and SARS-CoV, they are taking a variety of cantonment classes.
Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 is more vulnerable than SSTS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The case was reported on SSTS-CoV and could be a role in spreading it across the world rapidly.
Compared to and compared to SARS-CoV with other six HKV, the excess interest and difference is expressed.
First, the time for the disease to improve the disease and the HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, six other HCV-2 follow the common trend.
Second, the prefix of the URI-1 is between the SSTS-CoV and the People's Society, which includes four HCV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCV-HHUK1 and HCV-NL63.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 shares a feature that shows the community's activities with non-specific, light, or even unchecked presentations during a community-owned HCV visit.
On the other hand, a small section of the ScS-CoV case can be seen in a small section of the critical field, however less.
The third, SARS-CoV-2 community earned HCV-and SARS-CoV both show interesting characters.
On the one hand, the relationship between SSTS-CoV is more like the HCV-controlled HCV.
On the other hand, there is still much left to check if the travel between SSTS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be achieved after reaching into the human race.
Finally, similar to other HCV, the SARS-CovV-2 mall sample can be identified.
At least in some circumstances, whether or not SARS-Coin plays a key role in the field of the SARS-CocoV, it still remains to be seen by the study of the future.
It is particularly important to see whether the SAS-CoVV, like the community-sponsored HCV-2-and-so-called CV-2, is a huge interest.
Nevertheless, after reaching a human being, his efforts to achieve, his infections, diseases, and sustainable growth will be influential on the basis of the ongoing outbreak of CV-1.
Four common groups - earned by HCV are well matched with all the people.
From another perspective, it could be true that people have taken a better look at these four HCV.
In other words, both can be the ancient HQV volcano.
The HCoV people who have created serious diseases and the people who have developed serious HCV diseases have been destroyed.
For this to happen, there must be sufficient transformations among people who are fighting the cause of protection and protection.
In this sense, the outbreak of SSTS-CoV will continue to last long and more people will have more chances to adapt it to full human beings.
It will be hard to stop by other methods of self-determination or infecting it.
For many years, four-earned CV has been spreading in human communities, and the general presence of patients with common resistance is creating the usual.
No need to cure these virus animals.
In contrast, the highly infected SAS-CoVV and MERS-CoV did not have much to do with the people and could not be related to them.
These are required to maintain and amaze the firearms and possibly spread access to human targets through one or more or more transformations and transformations.
The SAS-CoV-2 feature features features similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoVV and four community-winning HCV, both.
At least so far, it is more like community-funded HCV.
However, it is more disease than the community-funded HCoV and is less disease than SSTS-CoV or MERV.
It has to be seen whether it is fully adapt to people and whether it is going to spread between the people without a coroner or a middle class.
Before discussing the animal source of the HCV, we will have a chance to learn the definition of the evolution, natural, energies, the middle and the settings of the HCV.
A animal works as a mythological replica of the HCoV if it gives shelter to the close-to-the-heart relationship by sharing its content at the top of the nuclear program.
The antivirus is usually tolerated and antivirus is transmitted in this asylum-maker's body.
In the same way, a sovereign asylum gave HCVK an intolerable and long-term shelter.
In both cases, asylum seekers are naturally involved in natural affairs and are the natural benefactor of HCV or its parents.
In contrast, if a new identity is introduced before the HQV man's identity or the right side of it, it does not fit well with the new asylum and is often infected.
This includes shelter could work as a source of human-related species and can be played as a change shelter in the context of the virus in order to minimize the virus and then expand the level of human infection through the human body.
If HCoV can't keep the travel between asylum seekers, the speed of infection may be preventable.
In contrast, between the HQV-Presters can also be adjourned and can start long-term infections.
In this case, the coroner was turned into a species of natural recovery.
The findings of the Mahamerian science have also revealed that the history of sharing the animals hunting with SARS.
The next Centrical Calendar Search points out that the outbreak of anti-SSTS-CoV was more likely than the general public.
A nail dog was first identified as SARS-CoV, which was almost similar to SARS-CoVV.
This information was indirectly supported by the fact that SARS was not aware of any other incident after all the garbage was killed in the market.
However, it is reported that the floods or the farms are mostly negative for the SSTS CILV, which indicates that masked pumps will only work as a substitute for the middle-class, but not the SSTS-CoVV natural natural.
In particular, as there are 80% of various species in Guangzhou market, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody, there are no possibility that a couple of small-scale species can work as a substitute to SSAS-CovV.
All of these are considered a Paradox of SARS-CoVs.
The next search for the SSTS-CoV is a close-up-related bat CocoV, known as the Rinolofud Baton QU3 (SSTS-RH-BRH-BKUV), an upcoming search on the Chinese-based Central Bank.
These bats are positive for the anti-SSTS-CoV Antebody and SARSr-Rh-BCokV HU3's GNOME CQU3.
This and other bats share CoVV-88-92% of Nuodotard Siquorage, Hommology SARS-CoV.
These research is based on new ideas that bats provide shelter for emerging human diseases.
CoV-CoV (SLSL-CoV-DW) has been identified from Bats, but no more than a nominated WV1 virus can be collected as a vibrant virus.
Human Angeologist Njim2 is known as SSTS-CoV's customer.
Bats, Ceciv and Human ACE2 were shown to be used to access the WIV1 coostor, and the people's ACH2 for access to WIV1.
Curiously, the CRS patients who are healthy were able to disable the WIV1.
Until now, the WV1 players represent the oldest of SSTS-CoV, which shares 95% nuclear cilestone homology.
Although these two virus have high level homology, it is generally believed that the WIV1 SSTS-CoV is not an instant parent virus and bats are not an instant asylum for SSTS-CoV.
Failegenetic analysts set up the same category, such as batting CoV-HU4 and Baton CoV-HU5.
The same host, using the same host, DPPT4 (DP4), to access the Baton-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus.
RNNA Polírez Crores from RNA-based MES-CoV are closer to the biologists who identify bat-coV from Europe and Africa.
Until now, wild bats have no access to any MRS-CoV.
The MRS-CocoV and the nearest relatives, CocoV-HKU25, are only sharing 87% of nucleus Siocenstein's Homology.
So, bats can't be an instant haven for the MRS-CovV.
On the other hand, research by the Middle East shows that a shabakwala is like Srofial sources of the Middle East in several African countries.
Similar to the human virus, the RS-CoVV, was collected from the white nose of a camel, which also signifies that camels work as a real spectator of MERS-CoV.
It is interesting to see a huge outbreak of virus (virus) that is usually light as the MRS-CoVV tests.
Ironically, not only through the respiratory, but also by the spread of the virus through the Mold-verbal path, which is the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, the questions still exist because many of the MERS victims had no history of communication with camels before the beginning of the symptoms, possibly from people to an unknown species that sheltered MRS-CovV on the way to engage with them.
Batteries collected from the Rilofufo Afiis Bats have a period of 0.2% of nulestone homology with the SARS-CocoV in RT13.
Like SSTS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the CCOV-2 and the RT13 are too high to determine the parent relationship.
This means that if there are almost no identical bat CocoV in the future, Bats SARS-CoV may not be the Eye of the CoV.
Perhaps between the SARS-CoV animal asylum keeper Huanan Sittari market should be sold and killed wild animals, with many initial cases related to the SHOID-1 case, a potential animal-related incident.
A number of recent studies based on the Mesgiomik Siquinsing suggested that a group of endangered vendors, known as Bonui (Manyon Jaavaniica) can carry the pre-marital biV cooperative of the SSARS-CoV.
This Novell Bloni Codie Coimbatore is a symbol of 85-92% Nuodotard Siquorology SARS-CoVV.
However, at the level of nuclear crisis, around 90% of them are linked to RT13.
They have formed two sub-communities such as SSTS-CoV-2 in the country's national tree, including 97.4% of the SARS-CoviV identity, which is shared by the same Sepseding Domain (RBD).
In contrast, RBD, SSTS-CoV-2 and RTG13, were further isolated, although Siquens Homology is the GNOME-wide high degree.
A previous study on the sick forest also reported the existence of the virus from the dilapidated specimen, which has proved to have been interesting with SARS-CoV.
The rally system and manual presented to create partial GNOME sequences with the full length of this volume.
We can't let this idea out that Pangolin SARS-CoV2 is one of the finest predators.
However, there is no evidence of the direct presence of the SSTS-Coin-2 and BROS-CoV-2 in support of the BITS-KV-2 direct source of the BARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RT13 is less than SARS-CoVV and BROS-CoV-2 related BROS-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV is still not established among cats, pangolins and other resorts animals.
Although the largest CCOS-CoV-2-2 and BROUI are found in the RBD, SSTS-CV-2-CV-2-CV-2-CV-2, SASS-CovV-CV-2 and RTTG13, according to the most popular GNOME.
It is also a great disaster that is linked to RBD, a Bita-CoV, and SARS-CovV, which is run by the Renaissance-based Missions-2.
A new proposal is for reincarnation between the third wild animal species, Brui SARS-CoV-2, and RTG13.
As a power in the evolution, the connection between the Bitte-CoV-CV-CV.
Still don't know the source of the SSTS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-profile HCoVV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HQV-HU1 animals have also been study.
Failegenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were both kicked off the bat CoV, although the HCoV-OC43 and HQ1 parent virus were found.
It has been reported that a bat CoV, along with three colored bats in North America, has shared close ties between ArcoV.2 (aluminist Bridge CoV).
On the other hand, the HCoV-29E was linked to another Battalion / Ghana Cowery / 19 / 2004, although the comedy also suspected of being a double-profile.
For transparency, the source of the current knowledge of the HCV-CV has been summarizes at 1 and 2 Table.
Nation's analysis has provided evidence of coV-s in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43s passed through the indigenous species, there was a guest of respiratory illness.
The history of the interspecies in HCoV-229E is relatively clear.
Batteries related to HCoV-229E have been found Alpha-CoVs.
Among them is an alpaca-Alpha CodiV.
A number of evidence support the virus from bats.
First of all, there may be a variety of shared culture-related communication with people from bats, but not with Albanians.
Instead, people have close connections with alcohol.
Second, bats related to HCoV-29E make a difference and disease among Alpha-CoV-Bats, while alpaca Alpha Alpha-CoV animals.
Finally, alpaca Alfaf - CoV wildlife found.
So, there's no chance that Albanians get alpha-koV related to HCoV-29E from people.
In fact, Bat'l is a source of human diseases including the virus, Ebola, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can directly visit HCoV-229E among the people.
On the other hand, Bat Alpha-CoV works as a pool of HQV-29E, but is able to serve as a sanctuary between al-Bagarala and a shareholder that is related to the virus, just like the MRS-CoV.
MRS-CoV works as a great example of spreading boiling species from the camels and spreading the word of fire to the people.
The evolution of the MERS-CoVV from bats was discovered initially and was strengthened by the next laboratory.
It is clear that the virus provides a rich and rich species of virus for its domestic exchange of cats and transnational affairs.
The long-standing, full colonization, close social interaction, and flying powerful skills are the favorable situation of being the "Virus's ideology" of bats.
On the other hand, MRS-CoVV has been in touch with a camel-version of the camel a few decades ago.
It fits well with these turtles that have become a stable and natural shelter from a central asylum.
MERS-CoV makes a very light disease and carries a relatively low frequency of the animals.
The short tour between the people is an accident, and people are going to have the latest shelters for the MERS-CoV because the tour cannot be kept in touch with.
Against the camel role of the MERS-CoV, it's different if the role of SSTS-CoV is from Pandora's 2.
In particular, Pangolin Bitite - CoV-Donges are highly infected among the Pangolans.
They can be the latest asylum for Bitola-CoV, like SSTS-CoV-2-2-related BSSTS-CoV.
The potential to contact people from the inter-provincial animals of SSTS-CoV can be included or cancelled in future research.
First of all, cats can be a haven for a virus related to SARS-Coin-2.
People can share environmental cookery with cats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, Bushowls can be one of the oldest shelters in the Middle East where the virus related to a SARS-CoV-2 was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting the meat and eating.
It is possible that many self-serving animals, including domestic animals, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV 2.
A study of domestic workers and wild animals has confirmed to be a study for the artists.
The third, as mentioned above, could be the restructuring of SSTS-CoV and the quest for a third species that is connected to both cats and Pangolin.
The search for the animal source of SSTS-CoV 2 is still underway.
Apart from animal shelters, it is important to help CoV support the three major reasons for viral groups and transnational barriers.
First, RNA is a relatively high rate of them.
Unlike the RNA virus, Nenvel Podigger's CoV Dictionary, the estimated man can be considered "35" from "Medium" and replaced by "10 years of restructuring sites."
A placard-reading of CoV is available at Exurbitology, which is the result of the disaster of a higher transition and even weak or even capable of survival.
The interest is that Neglard Andradivi is known to have formed a CoVV replica by pressuring the Exribiable and RNA-based RNA Policies.
Valentine's is one of the most experimental antiques tested by Nidañas Trials - SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the coV-ish rates are more than a million times more than their asylum donors.
In addition, the transition rate is often higher when coV-policymakers can't fit properly.
Compared to the higher frequency of the rate-rate SARS-Coin V, the beheading of SSTS-CoV2 is very low, a signal that makes people more easier to cope with.
Perhaps it already fits with another asylum maker near the people.
In addition to SSTS-CoV, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which fits well with a camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic recovery of SSTS-CoV and antivirus will be quickly disintegrated.
Second, the RNV, the largest RNV, uses additional ties to control and reconnect, which makes the possibility of evolution, including internationally, when the situation is convenient, is beneficial for the rise of CoV.
This is supported by a lot of unique open readings frames and protein functions in the area of GNOME 3.
"The third, CoV-Pertly and often change the tone of the RNA when it opens up a unique" copy-like "process."
The asylum donors who work as a mixture of coV RNA are often wearing pants during the transcriptions.
It can be used to connect again to create new CoV-Tires in the upper-length length and sublinumonia-based RNA-Those new CoV.
Natural restructuring Failology evidence found between HCV-HU1 and HCV-OC43 and the animal CoV-CoV and BatchV-HU9.
Part of the virus-related virus
Apart from three viral elements described above, a major cause for the transnational tour with host Recep.
Meanwhile, the reincarnation of SSTS-CoV was taken as an example that showed positive elections during the interspecies disaster.
Based on the relative analysis of the collection of human and smell SARS-CoV, SARS-CoVV is considered to be able to adapt to RBD, especially from different asylum providers.
Normally, RBD interacted with Rellila Rellila in a CoV platform and was picked up strongly by the response of the host Antibodi.
On SSTS-CoVV, RBDT stands at 318 to 510 amino acid that is bound to connect with the human ACH2.
RBD Bats of SSTS-CoVV, Cvette, mice and dogs are able to recognize different species of ACE2, which can be a central national on the virus.
In fact, only the remaining parts of the 632 Amazano app are seen different from human and the gagul viral isotels in RBD and the 4 AC2 are hidden from users to connect with them.
The CVet SARS-CoVV RBD has K479N and S47T, which could raise the reputation of Spic protein with the ACE2 September.
In other words, these two transformations may be serious for the spread of the virus among the people.
It is remarkable that the telescope is similar to SARS-CovV and SARS-CoV-2.
30% of STS-CoV-2 and SAS-Coin's S-Coin Sector 1 point that it could change its transition to the ECO2 conflict with the people.
In fact, a cro-EM study refers to the trend of public relations between the ACH2 and SARS-CoVS proteins from 10 to 20-year high.
It is important to determine whether any other recipient should be needed for SSTS-CoV-2.
Sadly, HCoV-NL63 is attached to the AC2, but with part of S.
There are many other HCoV subscribers, such as the EmnoPtidez N and HCoV-OC43.
They could also be the reason for the success of the CoV-DV, after their animal asylum-seekers.
In addition to the coordinates of the HCV-Ukraine international relations, the results of the uniqueness and restrictions of other asylum seekers were led by the reasons for the dependency and limitations.
These hosts can prevent transnational divide between humans and HCV, such as bats, camels and mice.
The HCoV must take over the reasons for asylum seekers to report a successful inter-species and destroy the reasons for the limitations of asylum makers.
In this case, the communications of the virus-asylum-makers are still available to identify the molecular and character in these areas.
A neutral GNOME-wide scan can be effective using CRISPR's highly sophisticated technology to promote dependency and regulation for SSTS-CoV 2.
Novell HCV: Return to where it started
Bat CoV provides adequate opportunities for the growth of Novell HCV-CV.
In this way, Batts CoV-CV works as a pool of HCV-CV-s.
Moreover, the quick expounds and genetic reconnection lead the HCV evolution and works as two important measures in this process.
For example, Novell Protetin-coding has the ability to make serious amendments to the loopholes or the loopholes lost.
Among the SSTS-CoVV substandard proteins, it seems that ORF8 is important to get into contact with the people because the SAS-Codecs virus was collected, but they were found to be repaired by the Proponent F8 Protestant.
The removal of a 29-nuclear plant was found at the beginning of the human outbreak.
This shallow also divide ORF8 to ORFU and ORFB, and it seems to be an addict that encourages sanctuary change.
Also, Alfab - and Gama - have a potential restructuring history with the SSTS-CoV community, where the RNA-based RNMA has been marked by a large number of small reconstruction regions.
Reproductive locations were also identified as 9, most of Nsp10 and Nsp14.
In fact, it was shown that the disaster was through the RR-CoV reconnection between different communities, which occurred in the camels of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SSTS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there are restructuring incidents in other HCV, where HCoV remixed with other animals that are not set up by them.
It should also be warned that the artificial election can contribute to unintentionally changes, possibly as a result of the release of virus from the pressure of the host-friendly system.
These effects are that due to the removal of B-nucleus, the HCoV-2295 protégés lost in full-length INF4.
Although the NazrF4 HQV-29E virus, alpaca Alpha-CoyV shows the end of the frame in a single nuclear tool.
Last but not least, Noville HCV, the evolution of the Noville HCV, was powered by the pressure of the elections.
When CodiV was infected by cats, they were not locked or only identified light symptoms that indicate mutual integration between CoyV and Bats.
Bats are seen to be more comfortable with CoVs than the possible ones and their desire.
For example, the problem of responding to the process of responding to the distribution of the product, for example, leads to geography led by CoV-Cs.
Moreover, the catalyst of repressive natural predator cell cells, NK2 / C94, and the main hysterical complex, have also been covered by the batter's natural predator, due to the low level of the AI category.
However, the high level of reaction from bat's high-profile retailers can be used to suppress the CoV phenomenon and influence Paffling in the form of a new asylum after producing a new seat.
The more disease could also flourish with coV stations that lead to neo-protein characters for asylum seekers.
So in the past two decades, the possibility of the creation of three neo-aircraft HCoV is not coincidence.
CoV-disease or their spirit shelters, such as bats and Uttis, are simply targets.
They grew strong without a strong reaction to asylum seekers.
Why are unlocked hunters seen and what serious incidents of human travel have caused them to remain hidden.
The serious symptoms are mainly active in the response to the prevention power of the disease, and the Saitokin Storm, where the reaction of the resistance has increased, the damage of the lungs.
In contrast, the reaction of the resistance has been separated from CocoV.
The same strategy could have a helpful effect on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 system to break the connection to power.
The reaction to the interface is particularly powerful.
So, it should be useful to type me in the first stage of SSTS-CoV-2 visit at least.
Moreover, the NLR3 prize is bad for bats.
With this argument, the resistance of NLRP3 inframaum with MC950, including MC950, could be effective.
The rise of SSTS-CoV-2 follows the common issues that were raised by SARS-CoVV and MERS-CoV.
A bat-coV has been found in the form of 95% nuclear homology with SARS-Codecs, while there is a battery that provides 96% of the SSTS-Codecs Homology.
Although the smell of the market and other animals are believed to have sheltered the virus like SARS-CoV, the immediate shelters for SSTS-CoV are not detected.
In a unique way with SSTS-CoV, Bushi Bita-CoV has been found, pointing out that the Bars will work as a part of the final edition of the Bushusta-Coven SV-SV2.
Although the question continues, there is no proof that SSTS-CoV is deliberate or intentionally motivated.
CoVs are back in the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SSTS-CoV2.
We have changed our ideas about the importance of CoV-CV, the source of human travel and the importance of the HCV-CV animals among cats and other animals.
The extensive evidence has proved that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are a bat source of information and they are involved in people's relations with middle shelters.
As the SARS-CoV event progressed from the market between the people and the garbage schools, the GW market would have ended effectively killing garbage.
With the same argument, Pangelyn Bita-CoV, who is closely associated with SSTS-CoV, should be removed from the pandas to prevent animal infection.
However, the future investigation of what and how SARS-CoV-2 are and other vibrant animals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been a long-term sharetap in the sand.
Other than the most important transport machine, these tofu works as the main source of meat, milk, milk, skin and wool for local people.
These are across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all of the URLs to control MERS, like SARS-CoVV and SARS-CoV, China's wild animal market.
To stop the outbreak in MERS, need to use an effective system to improve the effective vaccine against the MERS-CoV for other travel control systems.
We can't afford to assess the virus, but it can also lead to the outbreak of new GNotype.
There are many species of coV-dV scattered in the nature.
In particular, bat CoV - including animals - is very diverse.
There is a lot of possibilities for the evolution and reconnection of the Zootic CoV, which may result in the new CoV growth of the future, which is more desirable and / or potentially deadly.
Some parts of China should leave the culture of eating wild animals to reduce unnecessary communication between people and animals.
With the ordeal of SSTS, MERS and Neytiri ID-1, there should be a better preparation and reactions.
Many virus have been moving on Earth for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they get access to the spread.
Although Bats have many features that are for spread the virus, it can still be used to reduce public interaction between cats and other wildlife species if people are aware of them.
For better understanding of CoV and their natural asylum, there is need to be surveillance on the endangered animal, which will prove to be effective in addressing people from animals and the future outbreak.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases is to stay away from the ecology of the animal virus.
A few pieces of the puzzle is still missing in the SSTS-CoV source.
First of all, if bat-bat tries to catch the BushS-CoV virus, Bushbat and Bushrui have to share the same environmental cooky in the situation.
Second, if the bats were playing more direct role in humanitarian travel, then how people should come to bat-relationship.
Third, if a third-grown animal works as a real catalyst, it must be explained how it affects people, bats, and other species, including Pangolin.
Finally, as many breast animals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive for SARS-CoV 2, both should be monitored and tested.
If it's bats, pangolins, or any other tourist creature, it is expected that SSTS-CoV or it will be marked by natural predators in the future.
continue to explain the evolution path of SSTS-CoV between animals, which will have an important impact on and control of the population.
Update of the string ID-19 "infected" and "sure," is required.
On February 6, 2014, our team published a quick suggestion to identify and treat Novell Corona1 (209-NCoV) and provided us with this guide and provide us with a better reference for fighting against this tournament around the world.
However, a new disease, search for ongoing research searches and clinic practice is slowly growing, so the patient and medical tests are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment about our instructions and gave the new Executive Director of the "suspected case" and "suspected" case and "verified" to the latest casualty of the China National Aid Committee issue.
In December 2014, the 2011 Novell Novina Novina virus (209-NKV), which was officially named as DID 209 and the virus was named as the Cvian Acute Response Unit 2 (SSTS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 200, the WHO SchneiID-19 identified as a hero.
To fight SSTS-CoV-2, our team has created a quick consultations and published online on February 06 at Military Medical Research.
Since its publication, it has received a huge response.
Remember, our awareness and knowledge on the experience of running research searches and clinic practice is slowly growing; so, patients and medical tests are constantly being updated.
For example, seven versions have been published between January 2 and March 1, 2011, in the content of the People's Republic of China's National Aid Committee, as well as in the context of the content.
Now, Zou and his friends have made a comment on our instructions, suggesting a simple score based on their clinic experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our instructions and also created valuable reference for the tsunami around the world.
We approve of their great work and thank you.
Of course, the most recent disease in the Günther ID-19 has to be updated with medical instructions and their work in recent research.
According to the seventh version (3 March 200), the case has to be confirmed, with one of the two clinics of visual history, and if there is no clear AdemikieGeological history, then there are three clinics to match.
Epiphany's Geological History: The history of Uhan city and its surroundings, or the end of the 14 days of the day when the synonym-1 is reported; a history of the SSSS-CoV cases came to the area of the area (1), or the end of the area of the area of the area of the area of the area of the area, which has been reported in the last 14.
The clinic publishers (1): The fever and / or respiratory syndrome (2) show the White Blood Cell councils in the wake of the ID-19 visit (3).
For certain cases based on the suspected case, there should be a Catholic genic or syndicated evidence: (1) SSTS-CV-2 reverse testing positive; the full syndrome in the virus is not known to have a cure for the virus;
We have seen that in the second edition of the second (January 18) and the third edition (January 2200), the nuclear anti-nuclear time PCR tests and blood samples were included in the Fundulal period.
The blood sample disease was fourth (January 20) and the fifth version was added; and then the Selical proof was added to the seventh edition.
These changes, based on the ongoing actions of researchers, are the result of the rapid search of a positive nuclear identification kit, including blood samples, increased the number of sample forms, and the specific antibody helps bring the positive results to the fairness of the environment.
Moreover, more evidence have been found, which reminds us of being careful about our inconsistent syndicates and syndrome patients.
So, Zou and his peers should be updated on the flow list because they have introduced people with clinic syndicates as "less vulnerable."
The system needs to be experimenting with the next clinical products and studies.
As conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
We suggest to identify them, identify them and follow the most recent instructions of our country.
Our directives will be updating us with time to help our team.
Bangladesh Daily reported five new deaths due to the highest score ID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths for the day, on which it coincided.
The virus caused the most deaths one day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh's Center for Infrastructure, Control and Research Institute (IIIDR) reported that 14,3000 people were among the active and vulnerable victims of the documented cases.
The total number of deaths has been recorded.
In order to provide an online news report, the director of IEDR, Dr Meergedi Sabrina Florora, said four men and a woman were present in the death.
According to Dr. Miravani, the two victims are 60 years old, two, 51 and 60 years old and a 41-50 year old.
He also said that between the two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a luxury of ID-19 on March 11.
One of the local news agencies, Andoolu Agency's staff, said one of the victims was the director of the Anti-Corruption Commission in the Bangla Corruption Commission, who was kidnapped in Kuwait.
On Saturday, an online video announcement made by Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Prosecution, Obaid Abdul Quader said that public transportation will be closed more than planned next Saturday.
The public transport was started on March 28 and plans to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Medical, essential products like fuel and food were still allowed to transport.
On March 8, 2011, Italy was back in two individuals and one of them was the first to report the story of a middle-class ID-1 trip.
Until March 9, these three are still healthy.
A million infected persons worldwide have exceeded SARS-CoV-2.
John Hepkin University reported on Thursday the total number of victims of SSTS-CoV-2 Coronnani virus have passed away around the world.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to the disease by Corinavirus, the ignition ID-19.
The important event happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first Corinavirus and the first death of Coronvirus in Zambia.
Until Thursday, North Korea claimed that they were among the few remaining countries in Coronavirus.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization documented the attack in the past 24 hours of 10 Central European (0800 UTC) in the past 24 hours of the attack 1,1,1,1,1,1,635 people were confirmed.
In the United States, more than 10,000 deaths were recorded and more than 10,000 deaths were recorded.
In reference to information from John Hopkins University, CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people were killed in the United States due to Coronavirus on Wednesday.
In the world, countries have declared a more pressing move to stop the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobeun, increased the city's Lockdown 1May.
In a national way, President Vladimir Putin announced that if Russians do not work until April 30, Russia will continue to do so.
The national emergency has voted for 15 days in favor of the Parliament in Portugal; 215 votes were passed by 10 votes, not voting and against a vote.
Saudi Arabia has extended a curfew in Mecca and Modiana; the previous marker was only taken place from 3: 00 p.m.
Thailand plans to set a curfew between 10am and 4pm.
The governor of Ohir, Mike Dewen, announced that the state has increased its order to stay at home until May 1.
In Australia, shops have reduced the toilet paper limit to supermarkets.
On Sunday evening and Saturday evening, Australia's stores chain Olwarth and Colos have blocked two and a package, respectively, to buy every plate of paper on the national level.
Also, ALCII is launching a track line in space.
The limitations were posted as a message to the checkpoints and Chen's Facebook pages.
It is said that when people are trying to separate themselves, consumers are reportedly living in fear of a URI-9.
On Wednesday, Waoworths and home delivery sold toilets to a toilet paper at a cost.
These changes followed the limitations of four previous packages that were introduced by Ularthos and Calle respectively and March 4.
"8E March Coils" reported in the media that four-packet ban has been launched, but "everything is still sold within an hour of supply," calling it "unprecedented" and "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Ularthos, the sales increased last week.
Canberra Kostko's shop was also allowed last week for two packs.
To reduce the deficit, Colos ordered bigger packages from the weekly vendors and to increase the supply rate, Wolthons ordered extra stock facilities, where ALS has increased the speed of a planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Renewal Association, said that retailers are trying to increase the store, but the local council's restrictions on the distribution of the truck has made it difficult.
As soon as the suppliers try to adjust their needs, he hopes to increase the cost of production.
ALST announced Tuesday that after the stock was released, some shops cannot afford to afford to sell Wednesday's special sales.
In a News.comu report, the professor of exchange from Queensland University of Technology, Dr Gem Mtititier said that shops fill their stock every night.
He comments that toilet paper is a heavy substance that has little to do with its collection and when it is sold, the huge shelves are bare and strengthened the feelings of the crisis.
"According to ABC News," if he has a lot of things, and a lot of things like toilets and stores, it may be reduced, "Russel Zimmerman said."

The World Health Organization has declared HuskID-19 as a bride.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing outbreak of the ID-1-9 - because of Corinvirus SARS-CoV.
Although the term "Big Murray" does not mean how dangerous the word is, the global health agency still needs to take steps to the governments: "
"All countries can still change the path of this world."
"If the Secretary-General of the WHO, Adameng Brasas," he said, "If the state can identify you," may be treated, to separate, to identify, to identify and organize. "
"We are both deeply concerned about the spread of disease and the precarious level of violence."
According to Dr. Tom Freden, the former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center for Disease Control and Revenation, the world's Merriment is "unprecedented."
"Without influenza, without any other respiratory virus," he said in a comment published in February, "the world has not been constantly packed with time."
"We've never seen a plague through a coronvirus before."
"He said," and we've never seen a global plague that can be controlled at the same time. "
As a global epidemic, the new honor followed the decision of WHO to declare the outbreak in January as international concerns as an appeal to public health.
"Dr. Anton Fausi, director of the Institute for National Astronomical and Objective Disease in the United States, says about the outbreak," "the situation is going to be worse."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that the number of events related to the ID-19 worldwide has left more than 12,000 deaths.
This 2019-20 virus is a plague of the Nona Virus virus 209 (ISOID-19), which is the reason for the Cvian Acrident Syndrome 2 (SSTS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in China on December 1, 2011, on January 30, 2012, international concerns were declared a public health appeal on January 20, and was recognized as a global plague on March 20.
As of April 10, 2015, the case of 161 million Mowgli ID-19 has been captured in 22 countries and administration that resulted in around 97,000,000 deaths.
About 36,000 people have been cured.
The death rate in the case has been estimated 4%, while the global rate is 138.4% from 13.4% to New Zealand.
There are common symptoms of fever, cough and respiratory.
Among the spooks may include nemoonia and Acute Respeel Disrace Syndrome.
It is usually five days from the beginning of the practice, but could be 14 days from two to 14 days.
No visene or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary medical treatment is a therapist and a therapist, including the preventive system that covers hands, cover their faces during Kashgari, keep the distance from other people, and suspect to keep watch and self-aware for people who are involved.
Authorities around the world reacted by shutting down travel control, quarantine, carfu, the risk control and reality at the workplace.
As a result of the global wave, there has been a strong global and social crisis, sports, religious, political and cultural events have been cancelled, and the shortage has increased due to fear.
School and universities are not nationality, but the 1939 countries are closed locally, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's total population.
The virus has spread misinformation online, and the spread of information on the image of the virus, and the cases of the virus in China, Eastern and Southeast Asia have been reported in the cases against other people from the region.
Due to travel and heavy industrial closure, the level of air pollution and carbon emissions has been halted.
On December 31, 2011, health authorities in Ubean (capital of the province of Hubei), China, reported on a class of victims of neumonia, and an investigation was launched on January 0.
Most of the cases were connected to the Huannan Sea market, so the virus is believed to have some animal source.
The outbreak caused by the virus was known as SARS-CoV, a new virus associated with the Bats virus, the Bondona virus and SARS-CoV, the first person to know that the cure was between the person who had been diagnosed with illness and no connection was reported on December 1, 2011; and he was not able to get caught.
The market was linked to two-thirds of its primary class in December 2014.
An unexpected report in the South China Morning Post on March 13, 2014 indicated that the first case was to be found on November 17, 2013, which was between a 5-year-old man from Hubei province, and on February 2, 2012, HO HO reported that China had a new visit to China, but was on a sudden, and that the first time it was in Russia.
The number of victims could be underestimated, especially about the delicate ones.
As of February 22, there are relatively few cases of young people, mostly under 9 years and four% of the world's 2.4 cases are found.
The case, according to the official protocol, means the number of individuals with the hash ID-19 tests and the results came positive.
Until March 23am, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries like Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have set up official policy not only to check light-less people.
A study published on March 16 showed that nearly 86% of China's search for Jaffer ID-19 has been detected until January 23, and the source of the reported cases was 79%.
An statistics analysis published on March 30 indicated that the number of entries in Italy was more significant than public accounts.
The initial assumption of the general breeding number (R0) was between 1.4 and 2.9.
A study published by the United States's Disease Control and Prevention Center has concluded that it might be 57.
Most of the people affected by the hash ID-1.
The death toll from 6 to 41 days, which is the most common 14 days.
On April 10, 2015, about 10,000,000 deaths were reported to have been set up with ID-19.
As of February 55, 80% of the people who were older than 60 years old, and 75% of them were diseases with heart disease and diabetes before the people.
The number of deaths could be too much in the wake of the loop ID-1, since it may not include people who died without trial - like home, Nursing Home etc.
There are some partial information from Italy that the number of more deaths during the Gurkhas has increased by 4-5 times in the death rate.
A representative of the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Defense (CDC) admitted that "we know that the fact that there was no real number of deaths," a statement that was often reported in the United States.
The first death took place outside the mainland in China on February 1st, 2012, in the Philippines, on February 14, and outside Asia.
More than a dozen deaths were seen outside China's mainland until February 28- in Iran, in South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13E, without Antarctica, there have been reports of death in more than a dozen countries and lands around the world, using several methods to determine the death rate.
According to the region, the numbers differ, and the test, the quality of health, medical care, the reduction since the initial outbreak, and the quality of the population in age, gender and fertilizers, has been affected by the number of deaths and deaths.
According to public figures at the University of Hepkinsky, the death and the ratio of the cases around the world is 6.0% until April 10, 200 (0,99 / 1,6174).
The region changes the number.
In China, the number of deaths and cases of cases has decreased from 17.3% (which has been reported on January 1-10) to 0.7% (which has been since February 1 to February 1), and the death rate of those who have been diagnosed with a disease (which has been reduced to a disease), which is a result of the death rate (which has been transmitted by the other resistance system).
These statistics are not limited at any time and are followed by a certain community from the interview.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific population.
The evidence-based medicine center at Oxford University estimates that death toll is a total of 0.3% from 03.3% to 03.9% of the infection.
The top estimates are consistent with a statistics study on the study of Germany's first massive research on the ID-1 and the impact of the CFR concept.
WHO claims that this young girl can be controlled.
The maximum range of procurement and final time may be a difference between uncertainty and position.
"From the unexpected," said Magita Bonnie at the Phnom Penh State University, "the division usually dominates, and then, when there is no longer a host, it began to deteriorate."
But at the moment it's almost impossible to overestimate any sense of how to do it.
"The Chinese government's biology medical advisor Zhang Nanshan argued that if all the country can follow the World Health Organization's suggestion to prevent the virus," it could be "done in June."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from London School of Hunger and Tripeat, said that SSSTS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread for two years or two."
"According to research by Neil Fergoso," until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more), "the" physical distance and other steps are required. "
"It's impossible that this Corinavirus is related to so soon - so completely invisible," said William Shefner at the Van Build University, "and it could become a" dead disease "every year."
It depends on the preventive ability of animals to return and the need for enlightenment.
The lock of COVER ID-19 can be relatively non-specific and cannot be noticed.
Two most common sequences are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
With a relatively low number of symptoms - the cold, the spring-colored production, the loss of strength, the lack of breath, the respiratory buses, the neck, the neck, the headaches, the headaches, the bodies, the bodies, the bodies, the bodies, the bodies, the cold, the bodies, the nauseous, and the treatment of cynicals.
The United States's Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) has listed a list of endless pain, stress, stress, sudden confusion, wake up, and lips to make it more difficult to take care of medical aid immediately if these blocks are present.
Some of the tourists may be suggesting that they study and test people who come after the trial without a clinic, but are sure to avoid the investigation.
Chinese speculators of unchecked have expanded from a few to 44%.
The general inquires (in time and time) range) from 14 days; the usual five days of uncertainty.
There are still some details about how to spread the disease.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted by close versions and the caching, the cough, the goose or speaking; from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) to the nearest level.
The survey shows that an open cylinder can reach from 48.2 meters (15 feet) to 82.2 meters (27 feet).
According to some, a small liquid that could be used to talk about the virus could also be a reaction to the air for a long time, as well as a breath of breathing while talking about respectfully, though this virus is not usually carried by air.
The watermelons that are around can enter their faces or faces or access them to lungs with their questions.
Some medical procedures like Intutation and Cardialomonary RiesseStation (CPR) could turn the respiratory emissions and spread the air.
It can still spread when one touches any polluted pages with a box and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although it may spread through mall, the risk is expected to be less.
The Chinese government has denied the idea of getting into the face from the mall of SSTS-CoV, which is the first three days of the outbreak, although the symptoms may be more related before the symptoms are visible.
Many people had a positive result in the three days before the symptoms started, which was estimated to be possible before any significant sign was seen.
There are few reports of unverified cases, but some countries have identified non-censorship during the investigation.
The European Center for Investigative and Control (ECC) says that it is not quite clear how the disease is spread, but one person usually has two to collect three people from a few hours, and the virus lives on the back of the back.
In particular, the virus was found in the plastic plate for three days, 304 Steley, one day on Cardboard and four hours.
It's changed based on temperature and temperature, positive tests have been conducted for pet animals and other animals, the ID-9.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus among people, even though the British authorities advised the animal to wear hands after a touch with animals, just as the people who touched them will have to touch other backpacks.
The deadly symptoms of the respiratory virus (SARS-CovV-2) were first separated from three victims of a Noville, a unique virus, along with the endangered illness in Uranna.
All the related features of Novell SARS-CocoV are found inside the NAP virus, where the virus dies outside of human body by soap as it breaks down the cure shell of the virus.
It is believed that there is a source of a veterinarian disease.
The genetic analysis has revealed that the virus was united with two bats who were found in Sabzenas Surbacique (Lizeng) with the virus.
The level of GNOME's RTG13 is one of the 96% of the sample samples of another Bauv Coronavirus.
In February 200, Chinese researchers have seen the difference between the population and the population of the Burioye virus in February 20, 2013, and the only difference between an Argentine Accords.
As far as the whole of GNOME was found today that the Buna Buna virus and SARS-CoV are too large to have 92% of the genetic elements, which was inadequate to prove that Bushrue worked as a host in the middle of the area.
Depending on the temporarily-based transmission of the virus, the River Transmission Politimagez (RRT-PCR) of the Tramier Larios can be verified by the virus.
A study with PCR has suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many other features have mixed up with other neumonia and diseases.
"In March 20, American College of Radiology suggested that" CT should not be used as the first class test for the disease. "
HO has published a number of RNA experiments for SSTS-CoV, including the first on January 17.
The test uses the River Standard active polymerage Regeneration Action (Real-time refrigerator, RRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be placed on breathing or blood sample.
In general, results can be found within a few hours.
In general, the experiment is performed on an oppositional Soy tab, but also can be used in a physical facility, some lab and companies are preparing the security tests that identify the antibody.
On April 6, 2015, none of it was proved to be right enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the Siroological Test, which was built by Chevalix, was allowed only to use the necessary requirements for emergency conditions.
Among the pertinent people, including the illustrations taken by Radiograph and computed Tomography (CT), is the absence of Oreflel Ground gas and the absence of the Plural Ephes.
Italian Radiological Society is synonymous with an international online database, confirmed by the facts.
To mix with other cases like Adonet, to create a symbol of a PCR without any confirmation and to be detected.
A large study in China compares the PCR with the CT results and explains that despite the case, it is less specific, it is a rapid and more sensitive one that suggests it as a screening machine in the affected region.
The artificial intelligence association has been built with the virus's properties of Radiograph and CT.
The prevention tactics of the disease include maintaining private health rules, handwashing, handwashing, not touch eyes, nose or mouth, and the tissue in tissue, and a garbage dump.
Those who are already involved are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
The protection system is also recommended to prevent infection, and many governments suggested or controlled access from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the level of public society in large part of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among public society and that some people do not know where they were or how they were involved in the public society, the evidence of a desperate health service service that could be used to warn, beware and use the security of people who are in charge of reporting and providing a source of access to a report.
The administration issued a statement urging Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations to limit the surveillance.
There are multiple mobile apps implemented or proposed to use voluntary use, and more than one dozen experts working on privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to a user's mobile phone.
Then users will find a message if they reach a Ha-19 positive person, there are several misperceptions about how to prevent the infection, such as the cuff and mathwash in the nose, which is not effective.
There is no vaccine for the COVER ID-19, although many agencies are working to create one.
It was suggested to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC suggests that people should put their hands in at least with soap and water, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are in danger; food, cough, or sneeze.
Since the virus was killed by domestic soap outside the human body, it detonated the virus's security Buddha.
CDC suggests that while soap and water cannot be found, at least 60% of the alcococococoated Spanish can be used instead.
The WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unintentional hands.
The page can be stripped of some form (inside a minute of version with a fractures on the back of the Stelles steel surface), including 62-77% Ethanol, 50% isropl, 01.1% hyphon, 0.05.0-0.0-0.0.
Other sessions such as the Bencalcium Cloud and Kloxación Gluknet are relatively effective.
CDC recommended that if a single fairy ID case is suspected or confirmed, the office, the bathroom, the general space, the use of electronic tools such as tablets, tablets, keyboard screens, remote control and sick people should be released.
Health organizations suggest that people fold their faces and nose during cough or walk and cover the tissue properly.
When talking about a month of wearing a mask, it can be used to control the extent of the amount of water and the spread of the air when it comes to laughter or cough.
WHO masks issued an order on when and how to wear.
According to Lidos University's Virologist Stephen Grefien, "The" mask-wearing people can reduce the attitude of people to touch their faces, "a source of the issue," which is also used as a recommendation for people who take care of the disease. "
The WHO only advised the healthy people to wear masks if their high risk is that they are serving a man who is affected by the hash ID-19, although they also admit that people can be able to avoid the touch of their face after the mask.
Some countries have started encouraging the public to use the Face mask.
In the United States, CDC advises people to wear non-medical masks made by the CDC clothes, especially when it comes to the use of medical masks, especially among other people (3 feet).
Hong Kong suggested to wear a surgical mask while traveling in public transportation or in public places.
Health workers in Thailand are encouraging people to create and wash their daily masks.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia were prohibited without masks or nose or face covering.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The 8th government has ordered that a face mask must be read when entering every grocery.
Israel has requested all his people to wear masks as soon as they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about 10 million months of production since mid-March, needs to wear a mask on passengers who travel to trains and interstate buses in April.
Panama has forced the mask to wear masks when it comes out, and they suggest to wear a face mask for those who can't afford a face mask.
The face mask is also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
In order to keep social distance (also known as physical distance), the spread of transmission is also a focus on reducing the level of close communication between individuals.
Budget include: being in quarantines; restricted to travel; school, school, workplace, stadium, theatre, theatre or shops.
People can use the methods of building social distance from home, limited travel, escaping public areas, greeting and physically distance.
Many governments are now forced to maintain social distance in the affected areas by the outbreak.
The maximum size of US government authorities and health agencies have been met quickly with 250 people (if not known, the location ID-19 has gone viral) and then comes to 50 and 10 later.
On March 2, 2014, Germany banned more than two people from gathering in public, ranging from aging people and diabetes, diseases, disease, high blood pressure, and other pervasive diseases to "infractions," or "undermining diseases," and the lack of physical risk of diseases.
The word "social networking" (social distance) has affected the use of words that have completely taken people to social isolation rather than encourage people to connect with others in an alternative way, and some authorities have issued a "sexual health" to be used in a subjection.
It included only someone who lives with you, who has no virus or virus syndicate.
Self-isolation has been recommended for those who have been attacked in Copenhagen ID-19 and those who suspect themselves as victims.
Health agencies provide detailed instructions for the proper cell-residency, and many governments are forced or suggested to force or force the residents of the affected areas.
The most strict orders in coarantine have been issued for groups in high risk.
People who have been in touch with a man who has been attacked ID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region, have been advised to stay in Konstantin for 14 days from the last possible edition.
The tactic of regulating a outbreak is the repression and safety of the repression.
The initial crackdown on the outbreak was carried out, and it also aims to introduce and promote other methods of communication to prevent the disease from spreading among the remaining population.
When any other effort is not able to hold the spread of the disease, the effort continues to stand at the level of stability: some measures are taken to reduce the speed of the growth and the impact on the health services system and society.
At the same time, both containers and microgrant can take a mixed scale.
There must be a more serious need to take action in the crackdown, so that the primary level of initial growth can be reduced to the Old. The maximum limit of the outbreak is a reduction of a vaccine that is known as an instrument of a chemical curve.
It is discovered that health services risk the risk and give more time for the team and medical care to improve.
Other than the medicine, the outbreak of the outbreak could be controlled in other ways, including the personal preventive measures, such as cleaning up the health rules, masks, and overcrowding the community, as a way to make it more difficult for people to be able to take part in the protests, such as the blocking of public rallies and other forms of events.
Other countries have also taken multiple measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass tests and locally, and issued warnings on individuals' customs.
Singapore provided financial support to the concerned people who did their own quarantine and imposed a big fine on those who failed to do it.
Taiwan has increased its mask and raised a fine of medical aid fraud, the Van Van Vs of Great Britain and the United States prove that there is a huge challenge to the sewage and repression (but not to the systemic scale).
While the policies of climate change have reduced the maximum demand for health care, 2 / 3 percent and death half, health measures are still down to millions of deaths.
The repression may be a choice but the virus will be transmitted to the human chain (or if it comes first) until a cure is discovered, as the virus quickly returned.
The long-term intervention is the reason for social and economic damage to the outbreak.
No specific antiviral medicine is allowed for مصID-19, but there is an effort to improve the existing medicine testing.
The over-the-cough medicine will be healing by the altars of the Council, Frande drink and rest.
How serious it is to depend on how serious it is, oxygen therapy, intraversive (through Shiva) and breathing.
The use of the Statede could be even worse.
In the past, several young girls are being studied for treatment for other viral diseases.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic recovery" SARS-CoV-19 helps heal the symptoms.
The increase in power and the acquisition of health centers for patients by WHO are described as preventive measures to initially block the outbreak of the disease.
The European Regional Office of ECC and WHO has issued instructions for hospitals and primary medical supplies that the sources should be moved to multi-level and increased the number of employees to check out and monitor the number of routinely-19 patients and the numbers of training workers.
There are various theories about where the first case might be possible.
The first case of Novell na Virus was found in the town of Uhan in December 1, 2014.
Within a month, the number of Corinavirus's case was gradually increased.
They were linked to the most Huannan marine food market, where the virus came from an animal like this; or in some way, the animal source was shown in a nemoonia class, and the doctor told Xiang Xiang Xiangan in a hospital on December 22.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Uhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the "SARS not Virus" virus.
Eight of the doctors in Lee Wenangong were condemned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another high-ranking doctor, I faffled her to express fear.
The Uhan Municipal Health Commission later released a public notice on December 31, and the World Health Organization reported.
In the early January, a number of unknown nemoonia cases have been admitted to the investigation, in the primary level, the number of cases have doubled to about 7: 30 days.
At early and mid-200, the virus was spread to other parts of China, with the help of Chinese New Year's Migration and Uhan, a transport hub and main railway jungles.
On January 20, China stated that about 1,40 new cases were found in a day, including two men in Beijing and a Shenzhen.
The next government data shows that 6174 people have already been spotted until January 20, 2012, with more than 6,000 confirmed cases in the world beyond China and Italy on March 26, 2012, and more than 27,000 people have been reported around the world.
There were at least 200 cases of infection in the country and the region.
Because of the urgency in Europe, many countries in Shenzhen are limited to free movement and take control on the border.
The national response is such as some repressive measures - to separate each (known as residence order or robbery-down) and to whom, until April 22, more than 300 million people or 90% of the population, in the United States, and more than 50 million people in the South Bank, and over a million people in the Philippines.
On March 26, 12.7 billion people around the world were under some sort of lockdown, which increased by 2.6 billion in two days - one-third of the world's population.

On December 3, Uhan Municipal Health Commission released a public notice.
WHO was reported on that same day.
After the notice was published, the police warned the public about the "spread of rumors" of the outbreak of Uhan doctors.
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no" clear evidence "of public travel."
"In late January, the Chinese government started a revolutionary broadcast which followed the Chinese Communist Party general editor Xi Jinping described the viral virus as" the people's war. "

The airlines were affected and changed, and South Korea launched a program to find them and make people infected for the virus, and to identify them as the world's largest and most coordinated event.
Among the screening systems, such as the new international initiative by mobile apps, are the target of reporting, Virus's drive test results the next day, and it needs to be tested every day by 20,000 people.
The South Korean society was first polarized in reactions to the crisis, unless it was completely quarantine.
Many Koreans have claimed that the outbreak was officially abused and have signed the petition praising Maureen's prosecutor or his reaction.
March 23pm was reported to be the least of the four-day cases in South Korea in four weeks.
From April 1 to April 9, all new people from abroad will be coarranstein for two weeks.

The antibody can be used to monitor both diseases and public surveillance.
The antibody experiments show how many people were diagnosed, including those who were too disgruntled for reporting synthetic objects or those who were divided.
The disease is a perfect death and the ability to prevent groups from being attacked by the public is the result of the test.
Because of limited examination, there was no reliable information on the outbreak of the virus within the population between March 20 and March 20.
By March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there is a huge difference in how many countries are tested.
The difference is likely to affect the death of death in a reported case, which has a significant potential in some countries.
In a variety of methods, the specimens of real-time River Standard are able to be tested using the Comprehensive Politima Rélérérélre (RRT-PCR).
In general, results can be found within a couple of hours and two days.
The edited RT-PCR test is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus could disappear from its neck next time, but the total number could go on.
For the second week of experimental people, otherwise, it can still be used as a sample of the cynicism, or a form of material (thosse) that can be used by the sarcopter.
One of the initial PCR tests was set up in Berlin on January 0, 2014, using real-time River Trainage Rejections Action (RRT-PCR), and it built more than 250 times for the distribution of the World Health Organization (HO).
The UK also created an experiment between January 23, 2014, a clinical PCR-based SSTS-CV-2 identification kit created on January 28.
"This is looking for the RDRP," the common "engine" and SARS-Coin 2, the first company in China to have a PCN-based Disease-based Disease-based Disease Report.
In one of the three old versions of the test, the unsolved results of the imperfect reagent tests and a blockade of CDC's exams in Atlanta; a 100 sample was successfully processed on February 0, 2015 throughout the day.
The tests used by two tools were not set to be reliable until February 28, 200, and were not allowed to start testing the level and local laboratory.

In the same way on March 21, 200, the FDA received from a test that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses the ethermal nuclear acceleration technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not need a periodic temperature cycle, this system can give positive results in less than five minutes and provide negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 machines in the US and Abbot hopes to increase production of 50,000 tests every day, using a virtual anti-virus, which can be tested as quickly as the New Nacional Nuclear Product.
"March 200 has a literary review," concludes that "the initial phase of" is very low in the seriousness of the breast radios, but CT [computing Tomography) could be present before the start of such a synonym. "
The CT features a faulty, insecure, and behind-the-scenes distribution, multi-story Ground-Glass Kitifecity.
As soon as the disease was developed, the Saval Dimminance, the crazy peking and the Consumer were seen.
A study by PCR with the current source in Ulan proposed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but also has a combination of relevant features, including other neumonia and diseases.
"In March 20, American College of Radiology suggested that" CT should not be used as a first-line test for the ID-1, or a first-line test for disease. "
The preventive response to the infection is the production of the antibody of IgM and IgG.
The output of the prefix began after 7 days to identify the people, to determine the ability to access the disease, and to use them to monitor the public above.
A high-functioning system in many of the laboratory will be able to edit this animation, but they will rely on the growth rate for each system.
A sample of transtwidth blood is typically used for CLT, although the labor sample can also be used to follow the preventive response.
A single sample of blood is used to mix up the skin for PoCT in general.
On March 28, 2015, the FAC29 organization announced that the agencies provided the release of the agency, which required the release, and now they are able to distribute their apps.
A single test was approved by FDA until April 7, 20, 2015, under an emergency use.
The test's ability is a couple of hundred samples in a few hours, and it's too fast to evaluate the Viral RNA substandard PCR.
14 days after the start of the infection, ordinary antibodies can be identified, in the outskirts of April, the UK found that they were not good enough to use an antibodies test.

In contrast, experts said that the increase in tests in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the virus.
The South Korean administration has made the ability to test in private areas for years.
In March 16, the World Health Organization called on the World Health Organization to raise the test program as the best way to slow the development of the ID-19 massive population, resulting in the increased demand of the virus, resulting in a number of tests in private US clubs, and the pressure of the chemical shortages.

Depending on the proper risk control and action of the workplace, the rise in the agenda is a risk for the level of public society, the pressure of disease, and the risk of infection of an individual ID-19 staff.
According to the United States's professional security and health management (Ocacabe Satetey and Hubal Admination, OAS), there are regular professional communication with people and other colleagues in the risk of reaching out to the country, including the general resistance to travel, and the lack of health measures, which are made available to them.
The low-risk employment involved in the relationship include the job that does not know or have ID-1, but also does not require public communities to be involved in the ongoing disease or to stay close or close to international travel.
The included activists with connections to the public, such as schools, high-ranking activities, and a large crowd of rifles.

The plans only lead to various activities and activities, including the risks of increasing access to culture, home and society, as well as the personal risks of workers like old or permanent medical care.
They explain the plan to prepare for the situation to see the situation as a result of the need for the control and outbreak of the disease.
The preparation and reactions of circumvention diseases may be under national or sub-recommended recommendations.
Reactions to the outbreak include reduction of communication among workers, protecting vulnerable health problems, maintaining businesses, and damaging other sectors of their supply.
In the business where the disease is located, it affects the community's strong reactions.
A structure that is widely used to control professional protection and health care and efficacy of the disaster.
The most effective control there is engineering control, then administrative control, and finally private protection.
Engineering regulators are involved in eliminating workers from the risk of working conditions, and the most pressing solution to implementation.
The administrative controls are the need for action policies or changes to the system which require workers or employers to step up.
Public security tools are more effective than engineering and administrative control (PDF), but it can help in prevent some of the perceptive measures.
You need to select all types of PE on the risk of workers, such as the need to fit it properly, wear a series of details, maintenance and replace them, and open it properly, clean, and avoid pollution.
According to the professional security and health management of the United States (OCCeconian Sportsé and Hilth Admination, OAS), people and other colleagues in the risk of reaching out to the level of contact.
Among the basic steps recommended for all the categories, are repeated and well-known handouts, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, to use the cover-up buses, to clear the distribution of drugs and waste during the day.
An essential step to the protection of workers, clients, visitors, and others in the working space is to quickly identify and separate individuals with potential needs.
The staff who have been subjected to severe illness in the respiratory system advised them to stay at home in the United States's Disease Control and Prevention of Protection, unless they allow a non-perjury and other sick family to be allowed to take them to their homes, for at least 24 hours without being sick, or other sick.
According to Oberos, the work of the middle-risk workers is included in the middle-class, where there is no doubt ID-1, but it is due to the ongoing disease that is spread among the public communities, or because the person is fully involved in a network of about 1-1 hours travel in an international space (about 1.9 hours).
The organization needs to be used to restrict access to the infrastructure, and to restrict access to the existing facilities, such as access to the existing facilities, and to limit access access to basic facilities, and to lower access to infrastructure, and to lower access to infrastructure, and to prevent access to access to basic facilities, infrastructure, and the high-security facilities.
This risks require staff to use restaurants in rare cases.
If a person gets sick on a plane, then the proper control to protect activists and other passengers is to separate people from the 6 feet of the sick, a member of the staff should be identified as a man who is sick, and a sick person would have a mask or a mask.
When he answers to the sick traveler, he should wear the disadvantaged treatment of Kevin's crew, or maybe use extra personal equipment if the sick passenger has fever, or respectfully suffering.
The glove and other resourceful items should be canceled in a biological risk, and then untangled backpacks should be stripped of clean and toxin.
In the ideal case, the person who has been isolated should be followed-up to the service, regardless of the treatment of schools and children, if any concerned person enters the school building, then it should be recommended to keep the CDC clean or to keep the disease free.
When the middle level of the population is transmitted, social distance tools can be implemented, such as the de field, gathering and other large gatherings, such as physical education or teamages; the distance between the desk, the space between the relocation of the office and the rest of the holiday.
When the disease spreads in the local community, it is likely that additional school hours to maintain social distance, the daily routine of law enforcement is considered to be less than lower access to the CDC.
The law that would require lawmakers to contact people who are sure to have a GPS ID-19 or suspected, advised them to follow the same direction as the medical technicians, with appropriate personal protection.
If workers come in fear, their duty belt and equipment should be reused before reusing a domestic base, clean and curated, and follow the evidence method for the implementation of the PE control and cancellation of the use of the PE.
Some of the specified health care and death-related services in Oberos consider the high or high risk of the relationship between the workers.
The high-profile employment include healthcare supplies, aid, laboratory and medical transportation personnel, who are known or suspected of being caught or suspected.
If the workers edit the arsenal methods, or are known to have a GPS ID-1 or are suspected to be a sample of patients, they will become a high risk to reach.
The Arobella-produced system included checkpoints, digs, colored Costa Rica, collectives and samples of medical procedures and experiments.
The high level of emergency, including the death-related employees who were known to have ID ID-19 or suspected of preparing their death; it is also a highly high-level risk to be involved in the investigation, if you are aware of the fact that the patients are involved in the investigation.
The negative pressure reduction may be suitable for some health care and respiratory conditions.
The specimens should be controlled according to the air safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the incoming patient has ID-19 suspected to separate the area from the space, known as SSTS-CoV 2, or suspected of working for six feet of workers, and that the property of the aluminers is unrecommended.
In the United States, the NISH-95 or better filtering facilities have to be used in terms of health tests, training and meditation tests.
Other types of restaurants can provide more protection and the comfort of the staff.
WHO suggested a surgeological mask for just the spellings staff in the square.
For those who are collecting sample samples of respiratory treatment from the cells ID-19 patients, HHO suggests a surgical mask, geography, goggles, goggles and gloves.
If any Aurora-audit process is edited, the Serbian mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2.
Given the inadequate levels of PPP supply around the world, HHO is advised to use a physical barrier like Telphs, transparent window, and those who are directly involved in taking care of them are only giving permission to get them into the homes, and not only to be used as a cure, but also to avoid the treatment of the PP when it is needed.

We see ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
This is an event that shows universal human interaction and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best reaction depends on the creation of universal sympathy, cooperation and society in the center of this organization.
The passion between our colleagues through email, calls and chat is a remarkable contribution to the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I'm very grateful and proud to get all of you a colleague.
Last week, a man exchanged his praise for our work with me.
They reminded me how meaningful Wikipedia is to be able to see Wikipedia at the moment, and how strong it is to be online and to be able to be able to understand.
Your work makes it possible, keep the sites open or give our colleagues or keep our community safe whatever it is.
The information provided by Wikapidia is needed in the world, now it is more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will change some of the highlights of the next week as we work together.
Integrate our work and index
As Robin previously mentioned, c-team met to discuss our system and set up schedule for the next day and months.
We thought of the best reaction we have to face and the best way to preserve the culture at this time.
Most of us wanted to remove pressure and support our cause for a long time.
If you need to pack the dial, it's okay.
All workers, contractors, and contractual workers:
Until the next notice, our daily activities will be around 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing vacation - if you are able to work at more normal times, then the mission can help you.
However, the world is uncertain right now, and you need to take care of your loved ones or get them to the grocery or the doctor, our priority is to be.
We don't keep an eye on your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
Needless to say this, but we're saying it.
No need for sick holidays or PTO - just tell your manager and help correct your team's calendars and index so that the main fields of work are covered.
(If you are positive for the URI-1, please report the RT & C Ops bridge to help & ensure that your situation is appropriate for the authorities.)
People working as an hour will be paid a full salary.
We already said, and we promise again to honor our colleagues who are working as our contractor and the hour.
In normal circumstances, everyone will be given their work based on normal hours.
It includes that if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we help you.
Many people use their work as a way to drive their emotional servant from around the world to a specific point.
What we do is incredibly useful, especially at this point.
Again, it's about your own care.
We want you to contact your manager so that we can expect and adjust what we know.
Some work is considered necessary.
There are things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trump & Safety and Fundraying groups are essential jobs that need additional assistance.
We will start a process with all our organizations to evaluate our current target and change our focus to help our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, just the most important projects we can focus on.
It's not going to hurt you if you work slowly.
We are not planning to double the time after the guests were cut.
Do not expect to work additional hours in the amount of time, which is not practical.
We admit that the situation has changed, and we will work to measure new targets and times in the exact place.
What happens with the AP?
To adjust our new reality and work hours of work, we want to adjust our 200-201 annual plan to deliver the delivery period.
Our intention is to offer a growth of the 2011-209-200 plan that gives workers more time to pay the necessary work, take care of themselves and take care of loved ones, as well as to accept the demands of people who want to work during the next few weeks.
This increase in time increases the work of the current project and the entire organization.
We'll present our proposal in front of the board next week and we'll update the representatives and groups as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APPP team for your leadership in this case.
Office status, steel and clean
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues might have come up with the version of a halt ID-19 virus.
However, from a lot of caution, we recruited a virus vaccine worker in San Francisco office to dismantle all the backpacks.
Every trail and lobby and the elevator elevator on our floor used a virus that deserves a hospital to dismantle the banks.
The building is recruiting its own services user product that helps their tenants to protect.
We are fed up that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in a Wk, which has exchanged the URI-19 protocols with us and all staff members of the DC-based DC-based organization.
Last week, our DC office was moved to a completely remote shell with the order given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know we were talking about a place in Brooklyn.
The discussion has continued, but it could be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues know it could be repaired, and offered you some advice:
Keep the length of the meeting at one or two hours limit.
If you need a longer session, consider how to divide them in small parts for a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep a topic and send it before reading.
Make video default for live collaboration and collaboration with tools like Google Dicks and Zolom.
Keep a lead to make each meeting easy, ask someone to monitor questions in chat and watch over the box list, and ask anyone to write a note (or help).
If you need a comfortable headset, send text support an email.
Use your Welsh reimburble for Saxons.
Join # Remonewschannel to talk to your colleagues about the delivery work.
The HR operation team looks at the WAR-based Argonmology instructions to help improve the work of the foundation-wide distribution.
This past week, we asked all individuals of the community to cancel all of the universal events organized by the Eticia, as well as the organization of the Wiekimedia, until the WHO has announced the end.
We inform them that we understand that our request for the cancellation and other regulations may make it impossible to complete their grantees' activities and that no one will be sentenced for delay or resolving them.
This post is part of our special coverage Caucasus Conflict Voices. In this upcoming week, we will send extra direction for Wikipedias and other regional and international communities.
The whole public community is sad to leave off simple passions, but the wikimedia and other care, both seem to have the ability to focus on their own people and their public community, as well.
The next day, CRT is working to create a page on the wiki to monitor the impact and provide a place for public society to follow our communication.
Contact information by heart-8859-9
We'll send a invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 1400: 00.
We will share this time with additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting to each other.
In this situation, we are all united and help as we can.
At the end you can continue to search information from this email, and get other essential information about the identifier ID-9 on Office Wicky.
Keep these pages updated and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to keep regular contact with activists living in a significant country.
If you have any questions about the travel, events, a major Workstream or coverage challenges, or any other thing you need, please, and don't hesitate to work with CRT.
We are here to help and coordinate our needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive subject, please email Brian Zudan, Director of HR International Global Development.
None of these changes should be considered as our work and accountability.
In fact, it is an recognition that we must adapt to work and responsibilities that we have not done before.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide help to our customs, and provide them with services based on global services.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
It is time to help each other and create space for the next week and possibly the important work that will come to the next month.
You all need support to do this, and we want you to take care of your own and your family so that you can stay healthy when you need it.
Now, please, wash your hands and do not touch your face!

B'angeensio - Enjim2 (AC2) is a source that connects her lungs, heart, kidney and other cells.
With the amount of hacking of the ACE2 Antiogensin II, Angie's involvement in the work of Enzene (ACE), and increased it as a precautionary cure for the treatment of Carcalus disease.
The human version of Enzim is often referred to as HEAC2.
Angeensynn-modified Antasarta 2 is a zic Metalenelene that covers Andothetheelal and other cells.
There is an N-Terminal Petitidez M2 domain and an C-Terminal Colkrenonal Jamaica Actroter Domain domain.
The EC2 is a single-pass type I matmrenine protein, an active space on the back of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The ouster domain of the ACE2, known as Sheddesk, was split from the transmilent domain and was finally released by the proponent protein blood control process, and finally moved out through the exit.
The EC2 contains most of the characters: the ACE2 is connected to the Koblyol, the undersecretary of alcohol-related alvolas, the anti-terrorist, most of the arteries and the cellar cells of the surplus.
The expression of the ACE2 MRNA was found in Cerebro, Stream, Hypotholus, and Bristos.
The initial action of the CE2 was to work as balance of the HALC.
ACE Angeensin I have divided the Hormoo to Vusconsortium Angeensin II.
The Carbox-Terminal Jamaica finelanalano from the AC2 Angeensin II (Esp-Arg-Ville-Etir-P-P) and it's a hydrogen-hydrogen (H-P-P-P-P-P).
The ACE2 could separate several other products, including "[des-Arg9]" - Byradakinin, Anepeline, Witch Roafine and Agh Reylin.
The ACE2 neutral Boulevard controls the link-hand and the hardware disease in SLC6A9.
The CCE2 has been the main point of access to the Coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SSTS-CoV (the virus responsible for SSTS); and SSTS-CoV (the virus responsible for the virus).
Also, it is clear that the arrest of the Pexc S1 protein of the ANCI2's ENCI2 in SSTS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 has resulted in the displacement of both of the antidoessis and the virus.
In the process of the entry, the host Censor Protetives needed to take over the primorage of S Protestant, a possible cure, and a few have been able to assume that CONC2 could fight the road.
However, several professional society and control agencies have suggested that the ACE Inbitor and ARB therapy should be continued.
"On July 11, 2014, a system review and metatic-analicise appeared that" compared to control, the risk of using the ACE Inhibiator was significant of 34% of the population. "
"Besides, the risk of nemoonism between patients who are treated with the" ACE resistance, especially the high risk of being a control and a heart-resistant. "
"The NE inhires were also connected to the rate of death related to nemoonia, although the result was less than the risk of neumonia."
ReCombact Human ACE2 (RhC2) is considered a creative therapy for the damage of the lungs and was able to develop the lung hemoid hemorrhage and oxygen related to the children of Lung, including the deadly breath of lipoliposalilistas.
The meaning of RhC2 is about 10 hours and work begins at 30 minutes, and the time of the effect is 24 hours.
From many absentia, it seems that the first person in the audience can't tolerate the anti-apartheid system Inhibitter or the sick (RAS Inhibitter) in which the angeoncology of the Angeesol II has been forced to show the high expectations of the aspirants in their cases.
The "b 'ID-19 app h' is designed to identify as the reaction of the Coronvirus in 209-20, which means the process of marking" person "(" contacts ") in any contact with an" contact. "
In some areas and more areas, numerous applications were proposed with government support.
Several infrastructure has been created to build communication applications.
Privacy has been revealed, especially on the system that allows users to identify their geographic location.
The additional access options include the use of Bluetooth encryption to log users on other cell phones.
The cover of Google and Apple announced on April 10 that they would directly mess up the actions of such Bluetooth-based applications in their Andes and OS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an application that allows people to check if their battery ID-19 has touched the affected people.
It is used throughout more than 200 Chinese cities, a app named Tuttobi is used in Singapore.
The app has created local IT groups, as open sources and will be handed over to the government.
The app created communication and technology ministry and health blood.
On April 14, 2014, the app was waiting for approval from Google Play Store and Apple app stores.
On April 12, the government reported that the connection search is progressive and will be available in a few weeks to work like the "Statet" app in Ireland and France ("StateCoviid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering the apps based on the Protection of Tribegee app and Bluetip Protection protocol in Russia, a gefingman-19 disease app is trying to launch a georgt app for patients in Moscow, to ensure that they will not leave home.
Professor Ross Anderson of the University of Cambridge's Protection Engineering lists multiple possible applications with the system, including the lack of fruit and app's credibility in the population.
Apple's limited access to "confusing or harmful" apps "in order to address the spread of" Cornac "apps," which any agencies can only add to "public" or otherwise limit the virus to the mass organizations in the app. "
Google and Amazon have applied the same restrictions.
Those who spread privacy were concerned about the use of Corinnac app to raise concerns about the presence of surveillance on the public, especially if the infrastructure of the Corinite will be completed after the global outbreak of the population.
Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for 100 to limit this kind of surveillance.
The organization announced eight terms of government projects:
"The surveillance" must be "legal, necessary, and" theoretically. "
There must be a sunset order to monitor and monitor;
Keys should be restricted to encoder ID-19;
To protect information and protect anonymous identity and to display protection based on evidence;
Digital surveillance was to stop discrimination and emissions;
The issue of sharing data with third party must be made clear in the law;
People should have the right to protest against abuse and abuse.
"Public health experts and marginalized groups" need to take important participation in the "relevant stakeholders," German Kos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Without Borders).
The proposed Google / Apple plan is to resolve the problem of monitoring problems if they don't need any more of these devices to be moved from operating systems.
Some countries used network-based space instead of applications, which need to download and reduce access to surveillance.
Israel, the network-based recognition was approved.
The network-based solutions which have access to unbalanced location have a significant privacy problem.
However, the central server does not need access to all of the system's personal locations; multiple privacy protocols are created only using the central server for interactive communication (see below).
An app was used in South Korea to monitor the relationship.
The system was able to get tracking information from different sources, including sending text messages via mobile tracking data and card data, and sending them messages via automated users.
In addition to using this information to warn potential organizations, information related to the government has gained public interest after the outbreak of the MERT was approved by the law for extensive change.
The information is a lot of applications and websites that understand the public.
Until April 6, 200, the bishop has not been released yet.
At least in 2013, the idea of tracking privacy-saving communication with a real-scale research system, which started in the year 2014, was working on the more than a dozen experts working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth Energy (BLE), which is being distributed to other users.
However, the PPP-PPC has a collaborative effort to identify both central and poorly regulated methods and not a single method of behavior.
In these protocols, the identification data will never leave the device and the case is within the case.
The MIT Media Lab is expanding the privacy group SafePaths, a platform to use privacy techniques to monitor location and use interactive data during the spread of RFID-19.
It is based on a white paper called "Angoulême: Keep Private Privacy in a series of applications" (Apps Gone Rogue): The same initiative was based on a white paper called Makinonic Private Technology in March 2, as well as an initiative that has been established by the MMS-ETA company.
In order to not compromise with users' information, sensitive location and health information, Saffet protected hardware tools that allow other users and actors to embrace it.
On April 5, 2015, the universal TTN coalition established a group that was able to divide and manage universal integration to monitor and warn apps, a key factor in mass activity, including the same system and the bigger travel code.
On April 29, 2012, the Singapore government announced it had a free-source BureTrip protocol that is being used by its government apps.
On April 10, 2015, Google and Apple, companies that control access to Android and OS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to find out people coming to be in contact with, which would protect privacy, based on privacy, technology and privacy.
They also published key technology details in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system plans to acquire three steps:
To create privacy-protecting applications to find Corinvirus, the tools are out.
The direct shock of this activity in iOS and Android is: Google and Apple first distributed the system through operating system updates and plans to solve the e-tech and endless surveillance problems after the disaster.

Most of the victims are not serious enough to have a random evacuation or alternative, but some of them are serious.
The high flow of Nacial Canilla or Bye-level is able to avoid the involvement of the public hospitals with some evidence that the failure of the SAID-19 in the respiratory care of the patients is being studied.
There is no knowing if any one of these will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously sick.
Some doctors chose to make it through the interactive superintendent of ventishen, because the tactic is limited to the high flow of toxic transport, which is the most serious story among adults (who are 60 years old and more than 80 years old).
In many developed countries, there is not a high level of hospitals that need to enter the hospital, which restrict health management in order to deal with the extent of a sudden increase in the ID-19 attack.

It is not necessary to be safe and effective to show the disease.
In February 200, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of diseases.
Users are asked to write their names and ID numbers.
Using the app's surveillance data, 'close touch' and the potential risk of infection is possible.
Each user can check the presence of three other users.
The app does not only recommend self-abuse, but it also warns local health professionals, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, using cell data surveillance, surveillance and surveillance of cell data technology, and mobile phones to monitor people in South Korea, Taiwan and around Singapore.
In March 200, the Israeli government allows security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of individuals suspected to have been a virus.
The system was taken to protect people who could be in touch with the people of the infected, and to enforce Quarranstein.
In March 200, the German Federal Government passed the information about Telecom Continental position near Robert Cookar Institute to prevent and study the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to identify the terrorist in Quarantine.

Quarterstein can feel sick from the fear of travel restrictions, treatment effects or personal reporting.
"BBS Robero" quoted Connor saying, "The increasing social separation, lonely, health concerns, stress and economic recession is a perfect disaster to harm the mental health and health of the people."
The disease, like the other general high-ranking spring-spring disease, could go on with the memory without a few or without a symptoms.
A few victims usually get better in two weeks, but it may take three to six weeks to heal the serious or deadly diseases.
Based on information like SSTS and other similar virus, the pregnant women may be in serious risk from burning ID-19, but lack of information on OS-19.
Among most of the seriously affected victims, the URI ID-19 Spring-related illness can be quickly increased in Sindh Rome (ARDS), which could be the reason for the spring-related, setitic or multi-organ transplant.
In the complexity of the dispute between SEPES-19, non-natural blood barriers and heart, kidney and agricultural damage.
The blood anomanism is evident in 6% of those admitted to the hospital, especially in the time of Protramese, on the other hand, the system of non-natural trees has seen 4% in the group.
More than 20-30% of the population that exists in ISOID-19 have seen a rise in agricultural radiation.
According to the same report, there were targets, including five hospitals, and ten days between death.
Although, the hospital, which has been transferred to ICU, was within seven days of death.
According to a survey of initial victims, there were 14 days between the initial symptoms of death, including the death of the entire six-day period.
A study by the China National Health Commission (NHC) shows the death rate of men was 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
The damage in the case of a total sample autopsy in the lungs has been caused by the damage caused by the Alicia Fibrymici.

The damage of heart was identified as the magnitude of the death rate caused by the National Health Commission in China between 1.8%.
According to the March of the United States, Rogart has been in the hospital before 889% of those who were hospitalized, which could also affect the death of an area of societal and medical reform.
The death toll from this rogality is a violation of the regional differences, but also because of the systematic difficulty of the system.
Less than a simple illness can calculate the amount of the death rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of the attacks in the past, which means the loss of the current death.
The potential of smokers to be serious signs of ID-19, compared to smokers, is more than 1.4 times more and more and more likely to die of intensive drugs, and the long-term consequences of the disease has been raised.
The Hong Kong hospital authorities targeted the power of lungs from 20% to 30% of the population and showed the damage to the lungs.

There is much chance of disrespect on the behavior of other Coronavirus, but in the next few days, the results of Coronavirus have been reported on the cure from the PCID-19.
These incidents are feared to be further deteriorated than the resolving of a permanent relationship.
It is believed that the virus has natural and its animal sources, through additional transmission.
The real source was unknown, but December 2014, the spread of infection between 2019 was almost carried out by human infection.
A study of the first 41st confirmed attack in Copenhagen, The Lanseet was published on January 200, where the symptoms were reported on December 1, 2012.
The first launch of the symptoms was December 8, 2014, and the official publication of the HO.
A number of tools are usually used to determine the number of deaths.
According to the region, the numbers are different, and the test, the quality of health, medical care, the initial outbreak has affected the population's nature of age, gender and surgical health.
At the end of the WHO 209, the death code of ASTS-CoV-2, which was confirmed in the lab, was defined by the U077.1, and the unconfirmed SSTS-CoV attack, which resulted in deaths and deaths due to deaths.
Based on figures from Public Hopkins University, the world's death and infected ratio is April 17, 200.
The numbers of the region are divided, including the death rate of the victims (case fringe, CFR), which identified a percentage of the patients who died of disease and the deaths of the victims (not infected).
These statistics do not have a period of time and follow specific population from the infectious scale of the infection.
Although the antibody is not created among all people, the antibody can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, the Caselón Ddeda, a small village of 4600 people, has already been killed.
Gangute, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival and spread among the elderly, which is due to a relatively low death, and all the dead bodies of the Günther-19 could not be officially classified.
In addition, German health has not been damaged.
In the Netherlands, the antibody of almost 3% can be included as the donors were assessed.
69 (0004%) is confirmed to be dead from ID-19.
The death rate is different in the case of men and women.
In China and Italy, death rates are higher among men.
The maximum risk of men is in their 50 cells, and the elimination of privacy between men and women is 90.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8% of men, and between women there were 1.7%.
The right reasons for this gender-difference, however, may be because of genetic and behavioral issues.
The gender-based ethnological difference, the trend of smoking among women is relatively low, and the growing of male and female in a small age, such as the high-profile death rate between men and men.
In Europe, there were 57% of the concerned people and 72% of the dead were men.
Since April 200, the US government has not been monitoring links to the ID-1 visit.
The study shows that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, Influenza and SARS affect both men and women.
Most of the health workers, especially the nurses, are more likely to reach the age of women and their virus.
"On February 11, 2014, the World Health Organization announced that the disease will be officially named" shine ID-19. "
The head of the WHO, Tedros Advend, explained that the CO does not money, VI is Virus, D, and 19, when the outbreak was first marked by the outbreak: 31 December 2011.
The name was chosen to avoid the specific geographic location (China, China), animal species, or community mentioned in the name of Kalimadérélérérérélérénénéré (CO2).
"WHOO" overconnection "used the" ignition ID-19 virus "and" the virus "for" ignition ID-19. "
Both the disease and the virus are usually referred to as "Coronvirus."
"The virus and diseases were commonly referred to as" Coronavirus "and" Uhan Coranavirus "during the initial outbreak in China.
In response to the use of virus and diseases in January 20, 2011, HO had recommended the 2011-9-NKCocov and 2011 to name the virus and the disease as a temporary name for the massive spring disease.
On February 11, 2012, the name of the government of RSS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was imposed on 200.
Because of the limited access to standard supply chain Chen, some digital actors are printing the tools of health services such as Nezal Soweb and Venetón.
In one example, a vendor in an Italian hospital did not have the necessary time to give it to the supplier, but a local organization tested the production of goods and producing 1,000v overnight.
After the initial decline of the URI-19, conspiracy theories about the source, levels, resistance, medical and other aspects of the disease were exposed, misinformation and rumors were spread online.
It seems that people are able to spread the virus among other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the construction of a virus between pigs, duck and chicken.
No medicine or vaccine was approved for the treatment of the disease.
The international research has been launched by government agencies, the Academy and the Industrial Research Institute, and the Institute for Industrial Research.
In March, the World Health Organization has launched "mutual support" to assess the effects of the treatment of four existing antiviral youth.
No vaccine, but various organizations are actively building a vaccine.
The previous action is being used on SSTS-CoV because both SARS-CoVV and SARS-CoV both use ACE2 subscribers to access the core of the people.
Checking for three sticker tricks.
First of all, researchers aim to build a full virus of vaccine.
In spite of the use of the virus, the human body is temporarily unstoppable for a new tour of ID-9.
The second strategy, Subunit Vasiine, is to create a vaccine that focuses on the uninterfering of the virus in the specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SSTS-CoVV-2, the research is aimed at the S-Pc protein which allows the virus to access the CE2 Enzemia Grass.
The third trick is a nuclear acid vaccine.
In March 200, the first decree of a vaccine was launched with four volunteers in Sierra Leone.
The virus that does not harm the cause of the virus is in the vaccine, which represents a possible challenge to the SSTS-COV in the potential development of the vaccine.
More than 300 active Nidakanik Trials is on April 20.
The medical treatment for malaria was already evaluated for seven tests, including four studies on hydrosyndrome or Clariquilla.

A dynamic review of the creation of the fake ID-9 Vacine and Drug CandeTottes in April 21, 2012. Some of the existing antiretroviral drugs for treatment are being assessed by a handful of relevant apps, including REDID-1E-1, and Roosevy Rootevy.
There are experimental evidence of the results of Valentine's by March 200.
Nidanik developed among the patients using experimental medicine.
Fez is being organized in the United States, China and Italy, as was previously used for malaria treatment, including primary results on February 20.
Anyway, we need to review the research.
