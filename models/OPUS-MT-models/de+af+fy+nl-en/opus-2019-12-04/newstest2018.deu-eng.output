Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A lunatic institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who has had to get upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlas, an offer of the geoportal of Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but that is why it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.
The large map has included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called "Urposition sheets."
According to the Bavarian surveyor, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and were the first measurements of Bavaria.
Your client, Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
In short, Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison of the former and the present is the most impressive in the example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was drawn up, in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: When zooming in, a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbers of the "primeval" pieces from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer show farmers - but small gardeners of the "land in the sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the place of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen or from the hill "On the Ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was formed.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was in charge of the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called fools.
He has also forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first room, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany, has been located there.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training companies.
It is the seat of the TSV Munich East, and is the seat of the TSV Munich East.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built, in architectural terms, to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing.
The Marienplatz was registered as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 tore many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the spatter for the second S-Bahn main line take place.
The old Munich card can be compared with the air picture of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the State and to take extreme care, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted here in the group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination actions, and the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionately targeting minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are being stopped for their skin color, they are being beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gas during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are being stopped 75% more often than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring security money or to let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weiden project is elementary
The Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU Bundestag delegates Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fissbacher CDU-Ortverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments.
For him, the "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative route of marketing for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
The table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he called the Weidezun project "essential."
I can't be profitable on such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the engine sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions and the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a biobusiness.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weiden project and is happy about the Leader support."
Farmers should be supported at a cost of between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that this will allow the reafforestation of the areas to be pulled out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their business," the mayor stressed.
The farmers are often critical of the support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced through the support of the Weidezun.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be forestry until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of it was funded by Leader, a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac said, "You're doing a really good job, you can't do it without farmers and rural women."
For Peter Weiß it was also clear that "best food is produced here."
The Landscape Pflegericht (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
It is necessary to have a support setting designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be easily managed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be at risk of afforestation.
For the Fissbacher Weidezaunproject 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under way, which would like to build just under 16 km of fence.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, to his base.
When Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is actually right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the exhilarating words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poor, / your troubled masses, who are longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a glorifying attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative that brought the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States. "
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came up with something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognise.
Their torch should not light the way, but light up the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilith Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The performance director of the UK athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Cup framework will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the United Kingdom's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilith Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilith is rather modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilith brought in naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will take part in the 400 m hurdles in her fifth World Championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir is headed this way and has drawn up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotch to be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shooter on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"I am obviously very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on stage.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics over Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He was in the middle of the criticism, I'm sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This takes me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, so?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's particularly important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect for the principles.
He was also very smart to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is referred to as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people that swing the whip online.
The post office spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troller.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professional.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the message "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea, either, when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are being ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for the fact that he has condemned Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers took his lead.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to the newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordic, which led to the final round of the Archerfield left in the next year, before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it reaches its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I was unable to defend the Extremadura Open, as it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on the ground.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it went so far. "
With the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosham and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
In the last two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he took on his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health."
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are in some way in time," says the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation was more complicated than expected, as there was much hiding in the underground, which was not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of the car drivers in front of red lights and barricades is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei makes dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coiled tuber is taken with icy, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the leopard - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives to be assigned no fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late working can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after 5: 00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handover in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement that raised for independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua-New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car.
There are no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesian people have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing at her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the McMoran Freeport from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970's became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's Human Rights Watch researcher.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese waiting canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
"Migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native, who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the local Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokov's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the dark.
The scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took a start on their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football court in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, a command was sent to the soldiers on an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it is said in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many of the Indonesian, only bears a name that TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical maladministration in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be carried out, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who was charged with "crimes against humanity" by the UN, who called for more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military looked for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Pania's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Raised villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to how the injured were quickly brought in here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and have been arbitrarily detained under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are growing everything they eat: above all, nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run its own companies in a competitive manner.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting on international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Ecudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to remove the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report on Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the Group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and enraged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also took part in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people are in poor education and health services, except that they are living under the constant threat of a predatory military.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the Paniai victims' families carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that in just two years is going through the high-rise, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and got up in the fire alarm and in the people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire control units at 4: 00 a.m. local time (GMT) destroyed the fire and cooled the building down.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise homes around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the clothing, the external clothing to the decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning rates was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
This means that the five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated for this reason, are preserved by the traditional application.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was just missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the applications.
Not only did the proposal not come to the vote, after many objections, before the final was to be held in a neutral place.
New from 2018 only relatively smaller details are: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited objects to the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of banned objects were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had recently discovered that they had mistravelled with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers rather disrespect the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennia, compared to less than 15 percent were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately pushed past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they were aware that they had carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said that it interviewed travellers all over the country to find out how many accidental smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many did it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through the safety were the ones who were the most frequent to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a little complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about the liquids they can take or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the items that TSA has seized are the liquids that are prohibited.
For a while, people thought the TSA could look at books as a contraband.
liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to give the huge number of prescriptions for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far prevented some of the customers from withdrawing their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more massive sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time announced a different, less glamorous number in the recent quarterly balance sheet: that of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In the last few months, Musk had often promoted the new car with more than 500,000 previews, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 previews, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom £1000) "reservation deposit" in full.
At the moment, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, Musk agreed to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected to be 500,000 - all models taken together - and a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today may not expect to be delivered until the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production routes, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum capacity without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the incompatibility of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in a crowd.
EPO leader Pruitt is withdrawing because of the delay in the rules of Obama's era to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental protection authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as its agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is a time limit which expired on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-near ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or to hinder economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a lawyer of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection rules for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that are opposed to the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turn to ozone standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that gives us seriously. "
However, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its "power of delay and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a sound policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneider, who led the coalition of the states that had accused the EPO this week, said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneider.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection have been cheering about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump government's ideological crusade to offer to environmental pollution and its special interests."
Tumlings celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and supporters Tumlgens their concern.
Walter Martini points out: "It is a unique village little one."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg book: Count Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or the right to patronate belonged and not the other way around.
So there were people who lived there.
As the description of the city of Freudenstadt in 1858 shows, next to the village of Unterdorf and the village of Oberdorf, which is still to be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the magnificent center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 support these historical circumstances.
The right to patronate was created by the early medieval right to the church.
A gentleman who built a church, built it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it.
It was connected with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two is broken on Christmas 1673.
The new bell was first made in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648) the windows were beaten and the bell parts were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were stationed near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it fell.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the still existing tower-bow was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen are invited to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The final word is spoken by the head of the town, Hartmut Romann.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 3: 30.
A drink in front of the cemetery takes place to make the serenade sound.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumors and horns.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind wheels checked
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wehrt" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim Net.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind power plants could have been approved at the Boisheimer Net, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible, but the concentration zone also results in the exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Net, a change in the land use plan a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning condition, the approval decision granted is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting."
Current state of affairs: The city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
"This does not prevent the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind energy plants under planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the County of Viersen since last week," said a speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the process being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings in the administrative court, the district did not want to express its views on the content of the "Boisheim resistance" association on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four wind wheels each 200 metres high on an area on the Boisheimer Net.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity demand of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collapsed: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10: 00 on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The national road was closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the course of the accompanied ride with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person authorized the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaar and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants to the shopping bummer to the city centre.
As the president of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise the awareness of the customers of the offers offered by the city from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are invited to the "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, Christian König said.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This means that the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."
These include new offers, such as the first "active day" to the Brunnenfest and a sales Sunday, talks with all the professionals and hosts in order to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be redeveloped or redeveloped.
This includes tourists and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - up to owners, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was true to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Strich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that on the third "home shopping" day in Germany, five cities in Thuringia are taking part for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and make it more important for the common good of our cities," he said.
The action, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that any citizen with his or her purchase behaviour can influence his or her own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were hurt.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) another injured was in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were the school's employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas line.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump in a telephone call with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asked to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President denounced him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him: "You can't tell the press that."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the US to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "bad" and "stupid" and that the existence of the trade provided by the Obama government would make him look like a "dope" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moors Ford massacre: activists reintroduce racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and called for the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
The inmates were in fear.
"We want this n -- -- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Scream tore the silence when a young black man was dragged by the passenger's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost all of them in the audience cast out very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really incredible that in all these years no one was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of the estate.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights.
For him, the succession serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner puts a bed towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one's ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer of the election.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor was in the city, that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they got away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murder, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you get registered and if you vote, this will happen to you here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their presentation is illustrative, moving and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We do not want to talk about the lynching, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marmaugh is the co-director of Greenes.
He's been playing the role of the Chief Claner for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Maraugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive, because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play starts with Malcom, who yells at Hester and pushes him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona will return the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alert and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still tickering.
"I just don't think white people said a -- he 'back then."
"Yes," one of the other black actors tweeted.
"You just have to hit the hard" R. "
And that's where the energy in the room is moving, a sense of the camaraderie is replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and strong.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
This replay ends in a violent and fast way.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a wedding dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving "Strange Fruit."
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of the eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels like a ghost.
When the last notes of the song turn out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's names.
Children sit on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marmaugh, the man in the suit who played the clandestine.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his players and then breaks down in their arms crying, and the emotional burden of the performance breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason. "
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatter about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that had left the performance.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... to come from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks' court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The posture is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have suffered, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is, if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
He who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat it. "
"Dusk" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf is also putting on a colorful-frivolous stage in front of a huge, six-story setting.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows an optionally shady street corner with wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastes and elastes" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lmuhkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a body into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful, mean hag that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he killed Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause.
Sturmically, Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated, who is modest and the hands of Merkel-Rute are bowing.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is first shown on stage - given the great heat again in empty leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his management team was expected to be exciting.
In 2013, he had to pass a brilliant pipe concert, there were five years later great cheers, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
"You can see that the audience has grown with the" ring "in a way," she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its view.
I'm drawing a positive recuperation.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in a number of places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at the school on the open day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so a late-term volunteer.
How come?
Quantity: I made an abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I've realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I was wondering, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it is on the ground, perhaps at the point of focus, really.
And was it?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably in the youth school Herne do a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of operation during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from the old age home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Different from the construction engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in mind who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - one must always go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as a further restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure that the company was facing.
The reduction in jobs, which Director-General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction programme, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) to revive a business that was made by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1% in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Convoy attack of Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, a declaration from the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, the incident in the Qarabagh district also killed three civilians.
The bombing is the last violence that has taken place this month in Afghanistan - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A statement by the NATO states that the explosion took place on Thursday night when a common patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by a "person-carried improvised set of explosives."
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led troops in 2001 forced the Taliban out of power.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs on increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO transmits decision to delay the Smog rule after actions
The US Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama government that states are obliged to control the smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 States sued the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to move forward the so-called "2015 ozone provisions," and said it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO's intention to measure the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda, which, according to Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have led to the setback of the democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPO's website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase the symptoms of breathing" such as asthma.
Council of the Community
In the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area which has so far been part of the church community to be in the community's possession, there is no longer any obstacle to the planning of the project to be voted by a private investor.
For this, there is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would prefer to provide such a community area not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the seniors-just residence, but open to the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" made the round.
The decision, which was already made by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is taken away by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area would, Tjaden reports, be eligible with 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that in this respect, it is not intended to throw a stick between the legs, provides for the conclusion that both the saddle - which is based on the environment - and the pultroof - which reduces the height of the boat and makes the construction of the economy - would be possible.
Unnecessary, so not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean, be this addition.
If it helps, he'll come across the board unanimously.
It is not that easy for the common area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you don't get so much progress, for which you are now leaning out of the window in the common room, she says, "I'm doing it hard."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against a local participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not grant a grant, but is given a real equivalent, in the case of doubt, is the opposite.
Mr Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly is supported by three.
So it remains with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up in this way: "If we take the decision in this way, we take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is towed on the road
When crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Garath and was seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his way to Hilden by bike at 12.20.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the street of Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He was in a car that was driving a 66-year-old hero.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return car.
FC Bayern Munich has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game go against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personal concerns of the German football record master Bayern Munich are becoming ever bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (8: 30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with the BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the Münchner Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has held the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said and added: "The most important point is the balance on the team.
The last one was not good. "
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great faith that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights brings the fans to their attention.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the resin from star to star
The first "star path" is to be created in the resin.
The Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, they said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and to inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six places" in the Oberharz.
The question was about St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be added via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later the star path train is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of information, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the association.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was more bright than another, even though it was much further away.
It is also shown in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
The club has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a bare eye are often visible.
In the university city, there has been something similar to the planned starship - the Planetenweg, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path with its stones leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (community of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the plutonium that is degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are located exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exact 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is just four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to set up with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super Fender Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7: 00 on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klims noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia remembered.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all the fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed themselves openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he would appreciate Lomachenko as a "huge fighter," and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured by tyre
In an accident at the A7, four people were injured in some cases on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point market width probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre space.
The car swirled to the right into the bush, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour, then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
After the 2: 2 season start against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season, and with the result, there would not have been the two opposite gates at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opposite gates too much, and we need to be even better careful in Aue," says the defenseman of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the three-chain should also be further optimized.
And a gate after a free blow, the fortresses don't want to catch themselves.
"For the future it will be so that no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation of the three-chain, his team is better prepared than the four-chain.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have just in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"It is a condition, but that we are even better harmonised and that we do not afford so many play errors in the building."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But you don't know if you can talk about a bad start after an indecision.
The performance could be fine, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage towards Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely because of an storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue may even be a little bit fresher, as they do not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorites in their bones.
"But they don't know so 100% where they are at the moment," says the inside defender of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday.
"That we are going to wipe them away just because we have the right to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is very positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out the tests last year.
They are to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Network) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, migration network has sent out 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are constant.
"We do not see a great difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation was 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticised in some areas.
A skeptical is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we should not pretend to be able to, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Licht, the head of the road department and traffic in the government of Freiburg.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge, which is covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, and 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a border attachment that is also used as a operating route.
At the southern part of the bridge a bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.20 m wide bridge cap.
Then the pedestrian path shall be on it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
There is also a fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Schramberg, the traffic is controlled by a traffic light.
For the construction of the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden."
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is being financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest in German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to move in one direction, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AFD), what is difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left), represented in the day of the Volcanic Eifel, are one of a wide alliance, which on that day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites Rondell to the "big campaign event" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And the well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the afd-ers, but want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well-being square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and so directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that is there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the most important organizers, is really pleased: "How many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AFD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and they are also showing presence at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AFD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulcan Eifel reports that he has sought such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built-up Laurentius.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says, "This is the good right of the people, as a matter of fact, it remains peaceful."
This is what it does: around 8: 00 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfälzische AFD-Chairman Uwe Jong.
There are about 200 people in the room who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AFD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the front yard have a longer breath, but there is also a short time after 9 o'clock to clean up.
The police can pull off - no special events.
Posaune meets trumpet
A meeting with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be held in the series Haslacher Kloster Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8: 00 in the Kloster Church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Schwarzwald," or also "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in the bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of many international competitions and have solo positions in European top-notch orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned concert building orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the borders of the various genres.
As in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzechopreistrager Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play are mixed up into a fascinating whole work of art.
This core part of the programme was first performed in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and even more: the Haslacher Kloster Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "said Kristen Stewart, very openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think," Oh, that was cool, what's next? "
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually went bitter apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or obstructed me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
In particular, she suffered "Bang Showbiz" in the school period, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, "Girl, be proud of you!"
In particular, she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed themselves from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited coal from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work on it to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative entities in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is out of control from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, united message," said RNC president Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to be a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be re-admitted to sport.
Russia's athletic head Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to redeploy Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free to act, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Obituary act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1000 people of the two have thought of soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral town under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained cause of the crash, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she called the two killed pilots "capable of their subject."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the family in the church first took a leave of absence.
After that, the funeral party began in the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among these were also Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
They laid down roses, and the family stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defence of the Leyen called the surfaced soldiers "highly decorated" and work experience.
The Chief of Staff had built up the operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
And Volker Bauersachs, the commander of the regiment of which the soldiers belong, said, "If this crew could not turn away from the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubt about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: the use was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the royal house said on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to the decision of her husband, it was said in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a heap out of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prinzmahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for in the last 50 years.
The son of a French noble family, Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife was always flying to the people's sympathies, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year-old reign among the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for confidence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of myself.
That was like two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is, after the loss of the red-green majority of government for a rapid reelection of the country, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, Parliament was in favour of the resolution.
Before that, the surprising departure of a Green Member from their country-day group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green Member Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his group that it be included.
In this way, CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Country Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been the opposite.
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government had to decide now whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the country day decide as soon as possible its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national version also provides for the possibility that the country's day will remove the Prime Minister's trust and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined in a legal way, "said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace when they are legally well-considered."
Thümler called the second step "a bit kurios."
The politician himself said: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She called herself a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country's mandate, which she has received on the green list, with immediate effect," said the President of the State, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Green Group Anja Piel said: "We are very sorry for the decision of Elke Twesten."
She has deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even in the context that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the move of the Dutch Green Members Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only treason to the voters, but also treason to red-green," wrote the Federal Head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country day reelected quickly.
The exit Two is the most expensive red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests in the good of the country," criticised SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his member that every two be included in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 national election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the most powerful force in front of the SPD, but SPD and Green had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German Editorial Network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect itself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Foodenwarnung.de, the Federal Republic of Germany is setting up the latest information on the eggs in question.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health risk is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Federal States.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately turned off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the very beginning of the investigation.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, as well as the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, these are not operational.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, in the event of an emergency, there are too few controllers.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of consistent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
This is why it is essential to ensure that such events are consistently clarified and that they are handed over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be present.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be fully informed.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transport food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The armoured means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done in a consistent and high-pressure manner at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clarified quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules that aim to prevent unhindered expenditure by European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, which were set up by the UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign it and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be able to counter them with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the club's debt to the monitoring of its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP rating period, which runs until 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen into disapproval by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be committed to deterring excessive expenditure.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, towards The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat-rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the redemption for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has taken the most serious sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the Organization Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports published show that PSG 2015 / 16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association is expected to increase sales by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play, because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new toy supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white-packed 14-gram shoelboards distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
According to "Nordwestschweiz," industry insider estimates the order volume to between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is all the more important: for a sog manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to betray how many candidates there are in the new call.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the Spring 2018 Treaty.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate plates have been distributing the Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebau had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-range flights, the customers of the First Class are pampered with treats by the Confiserie Sprügli, in the business class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short line, both in the business and in the economy class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the final of the World Cup
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup and could only watch the Diskus competition from the gallery.
With the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachovski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's of the Grunge era (when the forethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By assigning themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the cast-out principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that swings the cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old-time gnacker.
It is the moments of random insanity that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I accept as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene the band will show how it will visit the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-Against-West Ringfight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-shot Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game of 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
Six long episodes, the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited to a lower length, could deliver its agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a success.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own younger history and with their own.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in fighting the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the Constanz Public Prosecutor on Friday.
15 accused between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects in Italy.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in operation.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor has been investigating Constanz against organised drug trafficking in the South German region.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
This is why the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The main aim of the investigations was to identify Italian nationals with a close connection with the Italian Mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Wise complains large gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Commissioner for the Management of Refugees, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has highlighted large gaps in the Central Register of Foreign Countries.
Weaknesses in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportation, warned in an analysis available in the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the data, the register covers 10 million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow back processes," the report further states.
In addition, the statistics on people with sufficient resources cover EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such false arrangements "led to a distorted debate on the handling of emigrants," it is said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently started to send refugee families with under 16 years of age back to Italy when they have entered from there.
This is from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "with regard to families with children, except for infants and micro-children, to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This was virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, with reference to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that State can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy had provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political speaker of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatening to take on human rights and to risk the child's well-being because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the municipal council appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even unselfishly," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the preserved ones are being replaced in their components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK district leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many of them have been written by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave away ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened the speculation of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" as it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee (MPC) policy makers voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that in the next few years interest rates would be needed to speed up the inflation that Brexit has raised, and she said that credit costs may have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut business package, which was published a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks as of next February, although it was said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
The Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
At interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "slightly greater" extent than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecast to increase first in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the Bank's forecast of 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have halted the increasing expectations for interest rate increases and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The recent inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as the increase in the rate of inflation will be even worse first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the fall in income in the coming years, but she added that wages will "recover" clearly at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the fall in the Fund.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rate increases had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy-makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the last month, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "totally" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market should again become more competitive, as the lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and take out the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the funding of the drug in the NHS in September.
NHS England announced that pre-sex preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which may reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the appeal court had confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England's head Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in infected persons.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that just enough drugs are available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is widely used, taken up and implemented.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Management of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us to get a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the big life: The middle floor and smart designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex-wife in Knightbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room estate with a sewn layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and an intermediate floor to make the best use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel works are rather complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retravius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is reflected to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about folding up kitchens.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, ventured MDF door.
"It is counterimportant, so that when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clear use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor surface while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters from something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a dispute about one of the largest real estate impoeries in Victoria, worth over $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to find out how to share their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes city offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third.
A court record says that this means that Colin has property worth 316 million dollars and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed mediation.
The brothers are now also fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out it.
Colin argued that this was not true, but accused Paul of incompetent management of some of the property.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage requires the family to be the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are increasing in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both-held law firms.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who did dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark are, Paul says, "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case was in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight," he said and added that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he was a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were convincing," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have already managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to move their own agenda forward by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preferences of the consultants to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove himself as a more effective manager as a priest, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped.
The police all over Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are, of course, not known, information from the population is hoped and asked.
Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to information after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' series.
Some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands are again at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were only thrown out in May, but they were not removed from a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incidents.
The tacit group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that was unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have endured the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They went there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers.
The Council must be forced into practice by shame to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by long-term training to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be called said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers, just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area. "
A speaker from the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solhull police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is a former hotel in Birkenhof.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30 000 nights a year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landrat Office as a collective accommodation in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious people interested in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some ceilings were cut off, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything was to be "close to the people" later, as Thomas Scherer said.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
You do not want to position yourself on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of downtown, stresses Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, said Scherer.
The idea of the city was the same as that of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US Special Investigator is setting up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was supposed to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
In the last few weeks, the board has started work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step to be a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
The channel CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have long accused the Kremlin of being involved in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller examines whether there was any agreement between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted in the election campaign as a consultant to the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also looked at more and more of the private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved to the center and examined the accusation of whether the President might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers.
Most of the time they are switched on when they are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people under oath for questioning.
According to the CNN station, the subpoenas have already been issued, which are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's counselor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former head of the campaign, Paul Manafort, were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller does not get intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
It does not necessarily have to be said, however, that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charge.
However, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that have accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that no investigation was carried out against the president.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, it was stated in the statement.
But Mueller had not been used until after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this draft, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation of the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair about the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the President's request.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could not be released as easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic, a huge iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has been removed from the Schelfeis.
The Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research announced this on Wednesday.
The colossus, which is heavy over a trillion tons and a total of 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants in the last three decades, with a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 km.
He's not a threat to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapse of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that has now been broken down has been a part of the Larsen C Shelfeis.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located in the south of South America, almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this shale, the balance of growth and abort was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelfeis had been destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of talk about the fact that the Larsen C Shelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could fall apart if a piece of the ice plate was broken off at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and the ice displaces as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelfeise causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project for the observation of the Antarctic (Midas) writes.
According to AWI, the Larsen C Shelfeis is the fourth largest Shelfeis of the Antarctic.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it regularly breaks down.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen C Shelfeis would grow again or go back in the long term and may fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not return to climate change the degradation of this huge iceberg, in recent decades many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decrease.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up by about three degrees and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants Haustarif in the staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant posts, the CDU calls on the employers' association to step out to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the day of the day has created 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 more trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very sought after.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann district.
The search includes doctors and engineers, as well as general administration forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circular and to counter the lack of skilled staff in the administration.
The management is to "develop a concept of human resources and human resources development" according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals, but to address the future-oriented shortage of candidates, it is said.
The overall approach should focus on the inside and outside, identify concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you never knew before.
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The debate is about a genuine "competition of public employers."
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service due to the illness or age.
So it is high time to act so that more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Volken, head of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a big surprise in the roundabout when he publicly questioned the staff cost cover and surprised the other parties.
People want to be reviewed all the possibilities that allow the local employers' association to leave.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a home tariff with the trade unions, perhaps in cooperation with the associated cities," said peoples.
This means that the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for public service tariff information.
The salaries are currently strictly required, and there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy is stepping up the tone of NGO-migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Salvation', because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Salvation', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew will take on board the tuxedo migrants who are directly delivered to them by human traffickers and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of going beyond the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about "substantial changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organisation is doctors without borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which has led to a loss in efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries are leaving in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two hosts met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
For this, three friends were available.
The accommodation at the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfalz forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People's Festival Wurstmarkt.
Again, the lookout point was at the lookout point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, a lot of height meters have been called up again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and indoors brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed into the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting over the stadium lawn in the wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July, signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says the board of directors Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that a number of clubs are still on this train."
This weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which the gamers of different clubs will compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be much more present on these markets online than only once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA are developed at a competitive level.
For the longest time, as in the normal sport, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals are against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of a habit.
Ingo Frobegel has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response ability are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fat player is a good player."
But Froegel also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientist positively highlights the high integration effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to e-sport.
In 2016, it had implemented EUR 50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already on the international side.
The major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US NRG eSports team.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikron.
There is also a lot of work going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a field of education, says Frobegel.
In the Netherlands and France, the football first-league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB's board of directors, Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is not enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," also says Dutt.
"There is no way to hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains the same as it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal states are affected by the scandal of toxic eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all the eggs from the sale all over Germany.
Only eggs that are not shown to contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to kill herself through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years being suspended to parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy had a mental illness.
In red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes pointing down when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible fact that they completely regret."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions."
A state attorney read a statement by Rose's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that there is "no day in which I do not trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity. "
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would "be persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with since I was born every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text communications revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimme was allowed to be a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
FC Bayern has a big season for the Confed Cup winner - it does not harm extra motivation.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimme saw immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, he made the binding to his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first operation as a Bayern captain.
Well, it could have been better off than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach, Kimme, could have been that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a player in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debtors and just come from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who you want to keep in a mood.
So who was chosen to take the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimme confirmed: "This is what you want to take responsibility as a player."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flicked over the field as a mini-Lahm.
On the right, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did its rest.
And at all, Kimme was in this start-up formation like the one who can best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He had a look at the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his missing fitness (did not work out); Renato Sanches to come out to hell with the services of the Asia journey (even if it was necessary); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
That worked out pretty well.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to make a few success in the design of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we hoped it would be."
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shift, time change: "I was also brought for this style."
How unusual this Bayern-Welt is for the new entrances, one saw after the game.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but probably six or seven interviews.
Kimme said good-bye to some of his new players after a couple of crunchy statements.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game. "
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates OFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's best-known football player just before the game has registered on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies wish them all the best.
The Bayern-Legionaire is actually a club colleague of ÖFB-Kapitänin Schnaderbeck and is with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation.
The famous Bayern Dusel might well be needed by our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfälzisches Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often inreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of the Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wessing (FDP) is in office.
At the request of T V, chambers and companies in the region are talking about a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister is repugnant.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wessing takes up the wishes of the economy that has all blocked Lemke."
The biggest turning point in infrastructure policy is Natus: the distance of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process, and the construction law will be in place by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West Departure Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Weplan.
The aim is to start the line in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as Wissing has suggested, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been going down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the completed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are independent within ten years of the master's training.
The list of homework for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, it was quick to create facts, at the same time the country lacked the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in the state-owned business, only 29 jobs have been employed.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also important to note the existing broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had only assessed the supply of the network in an IHK survey with a score of 3.4.
They complained about stacking Internet connections and abortions.
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of inconsistency it was already in the field again.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company considered that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and therefore referred to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen that could control the use of so-called off-line devices to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested, but return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission rules in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be a difficult burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is making a disproportionate contribution to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft is going through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
He who moves to the Isar again on Saturday will see a great raft there between the Flaucher and the Reichenbach Bridge.
And that's not a regular raft with Isar tourists.
But the construction unit wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large infotranscent.
It shows a dump.
The opening of a public relations campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild flow.
Last summer, the raft went over the Isar and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon characters, the noses of his figures are his trademark.
The Argentinean still draws with 85 and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he made his way through, among other things, as a drawing artist for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he was able to make a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found a lot of fans.
The artist was inspired by cities over and over again.
Large, round Mordillo figures are in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his daring figures still find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
For the first time his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions of drought and the disease-transmitted insects, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits diaphragm, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringia Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary.
This Saturday and Sunday is a feast of the Middle Ages.
Crackets, ignites, dealers, vagants or a land-use camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on a Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasingly drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to provide perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government or the cartel payroll, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest of the violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "justice," depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all are."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two grown-up children behind.
Rumors tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoons for drug queens that are bigger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First in February there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without hitting on the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot" Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take on the task that you do as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, was his love for the routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarital said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulimas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before that, it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug links are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to government expenditure, which focused on the home town of the governor.
And there was a group that took a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the DA's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-level cases of corruption.
Villarbital asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was deprived of a military attack.
Only a few months before, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarbital, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body status.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office was redesigned to be the storage room for signs and stickers who are protesting the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the DA's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on the roads and buildings.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked for the government to redivide her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crimes, government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also by order of politicians and security forces that were under the control of organised crime.
The "Ariculo 19" media security group has allocated more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants in the past year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are being hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is scaring him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to hump.
A number of shootings with tire rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the border they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens wept up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were watching to see if they were ready.
If they were even afraid, they wouldn't show it.
Under the great portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report."
Dinosaurs used cover to evade his enemies
At first sight it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they could even find that his shady skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievably well-preserved condition has startled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herb is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The Fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clamp.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you're just blinking your eyes a little, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."
Researchers have found that, even though it is covered in armor and similar to a changing tank, this plant-eater was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed a better mix in his environment and avoid his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully discover it.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter-shadow, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter-shadow is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond that of today's living animals.
It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution was a means of survival to the veil of confrontation.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the time of the chalk must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved shady skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early days of the chalk.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just peeling a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he's sleeping. "
The time of the chalk was a time when the earth was going through the earth as huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumbled in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that were on his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herb was swam through Western Canada until a flooded river flowed it into the open sea.
But the underwater pollination of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisitem detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover wooden tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the wooden armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambola.
There are numerous injured, kilometer-long congestion and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen terminals (Aichach-Friedberg district), almost 30 vehicles were intertwined during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
There was no information on the exact number of victims.
They were mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
As a report by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - through numerous Gaffers.
The fire department noted the vehicle handlebars, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing suspicious you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you're into your work and you just have a genius thought.
And then, pufff.
The shepherd comes and wakes up an ungentle or pulls the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Card control.
But the times of interruptions are almost over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncreated ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently on two routes.
"If the offer is on, let's extend it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "said a railway speaker.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without the owner.
However, in order to be able to use these, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You must also have it through the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most comfortable way to book the ticket anyway.
And the last thing you need is a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, you call your ticket under "My tickets."
The test customers then have a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants will be notified on their mobile devices that the passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train attendant without ticket control, you can check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train, "says Michael Peterson, marketing board of DB long-distance transport.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs."
Those who often drive a train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are one of the biggest concerns.
For often you, but in any case one of the passengers, do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train crew and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket and at the end of the day takes the time for the worker to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same line are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped off her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who were screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Browns' father, who was wearing a sign with the inscription, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop unsecured his gun and cried, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and wept. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing at 11: 00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take her, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black woman child.
I feel that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-charges.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. "
During a night demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not concentrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought the project closer, together with six other locals, the team of "Whese Streets?" followed in the years after Browns was shot.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are being represented, for that is how I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Life Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, made the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It is not a coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos."
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Sternwahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friend Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side: "Don't need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Sternwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, the other business benefits, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the property where the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will be over with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Farms Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy.
We have also discovered the butcher's eggs for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, that's what it is.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
This is not likely to be very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "What about the shopping palace in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets, I think it's unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rent there is often not portable for a retailer.
It is a shame, there are almost no more special shops, and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
In particular, where is the farm market hall to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all the shops out of Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farm market hall, thanks to the insanely many - I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst used a 35-year sentence after making secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - by the algorithm analysis of DNA extracted by Manning.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
The prison suppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grain black-and-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette and gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people could look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supported Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and it would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would in fact only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further unravel the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture," with her overlarge signature (the "i" in her family name is a heart).
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-foot of Cs and Gs and ashes, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a free phone in her hand from the United States' disciplinary barracks like King Kong.
"If they kill your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose-headed when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by its own genomic simulators, which gather like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A country-wide human hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are wanted as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the Cook County District District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
He has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lahim was now on leave and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he was urging the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are increasing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lahim and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-supported doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales point RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be redeployed.
Aldi doesn't sell any eggs for now
This was communicated to the groups of companies.
It was a mere precaution that it was not possible to assume any further health impairment, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for anti-lacing agents containing fipronilic substances.
Aldi wants to make it clear and transparent to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' luck in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so that you can drill, why.
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $11.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, which helps company to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found to treat its employees badly or to be unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Converent, problems that have been previously hidden by managers who were in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have been before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong to, and that the work you are doing is worth it, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees work and are engaged.
If the third-party analysis tools promise to increase commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointment and demotify employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Will you take care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11: 00 when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new training fields on the campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inaction minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise, before returning to the Aquarius Football Center the next morning at 6: 30.
"This is a real tremmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7: 15 to meet the already packed time plans of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras's six times of practice in Westwood.
They are to hold 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA, even if it added another point to the many busy routes of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished, which will not be an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields of view from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been thrown with foot balls that have a protection network behind a torso post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend on, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our safety," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far from being able to think that people are renting a room there and then they are setting up to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to step up the review of facts in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party factorists and then display their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It's one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to factcheckers that may display results of the factexamination from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not succeed in quickly eliminating hate-filled postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started.
"In addition to the recognition of which stories are challenged by third party factreviewers, people want to make more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I like to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'is a time that stretches from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his fingerprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting a little"), all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape planners, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only got full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let it all go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to get in. "
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to get back to the fucking life."
Campaign launched: over 300 years old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf covered
With the cover of the 301-year-old Mary Chapel in Röndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round show).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or? "the makers of the action ask since yesterday on the posters at the Röndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as a bath of Honnefer citizens we know well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it is said.
"It is necessary to make a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign a mean five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises about retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
So is this week.
At first sight, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it was before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Prime Ministers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, have now taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
The civilians in the YAS were thus in excess.
The government is attracting the reins in the military.
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Chief of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exil preacher Fethullah Gülen, who Erdogan sees as a wire of the coup attempt.
For 486 people who are to have been directly involved in the coup trial, they have been negotiating in Ankara since this week.
As early as the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow him as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean the forces."
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uneasy in the military headquarters."
In the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifested in the lifting of the ban on the head of soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the big-time work of the army and the security forces continues.
In the middle of July, Erdogan had another 7395 government officers fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times, they called on them to play their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing ahead with the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a so-called unnamed officer who, after the coup attempt, sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years' time.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave the nato cold.
In any case, after the cleansing, the alliance has doubts about the Turkish army's willingness to work.
The management structures and operational skills are "weakened," say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-based visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US is spending green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for racing shuttle
Over and over again in the last few months, the future of the race shuttle had been challenged - now it is to be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is to be built on the marode route on which the tourist railway is on.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race shuttle, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the line is to start this year.
"With the decision to further order and reconstruct the line Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism," said transport state secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finally voted on, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as an operator were already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company was concluded for an 11-year period.
In this way, the Racesteg shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Racesteig Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Racesteig stations, mainly for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route was used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future.
The line is also very narrow in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest warts and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we are going to see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of starvation and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," the website of True Companion warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the allusions to rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, you worry the most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have roxxxy?" is said on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumption culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a President in the White House who has been bragging about having sexually attacked women.
The most terrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Virgin ') are not the graphic images, the faded bodies and the eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
They can't separate themselves from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might interfere with the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are fine slaves.
Or to express it in the way of 2017: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the concept of the common sense
It has become a feature of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's chosen relatives.
We're all supposed to be trying to blow our filter bubbles.
The power of Trumps to bring families together has been less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the devastating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his little kittens will no longer reject us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans "normalize" the right wing, which suddenly appear to be a concept of reasonable in comparison to its standards.
I now find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urban version of the lunatic - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - which, in fact, in comparison to Trump, are found to be a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals are turning to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés disappoint a city: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-old, one-11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily, no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This does not only slow down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood with an apology, while I was tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with chest pain from prison
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he suffered from a case in his cell by the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to commit this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.
The National Criminal Enforcement Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-clässler from Fützen and Eppenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday night, the school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental House in Eppenhofen.
As a symbol of the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm, but was then released into freedom.
In addition, the munders performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Hünerhof."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it spread out from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain, and fled.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gackles, the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
The young animal was different from the other young animals (chicks), but was part of it.
He'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every four-year-old to feel accepted in his new school.
Thank you to the colleagues, former head of the school Michael Müller, who is always taking part in the school passes, and to the parents' representatives.
The kitchens are now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to leave her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the four-year-olds.
In the end, all the students made a song of summer and holiday.
The children had great joy.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted on television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal people, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars in the Emission Class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have mould software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Office of Transport (KBA) has ordered its retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that he will send a letter to every person concerned.
If an inspection was due in any case, it would be done within the framework of the inspection.
How long should the total change take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is likely that foreign producers would go after them.
Does a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now threaten?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallaade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and, together with his wife Melania, will participate in the ceremony.
As a result, the progressive TV series winner Lear announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to remove the means - and that is a burden to me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after the former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The body is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun of the way he talks in the press.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
In this way, with due regard for the regular notice periods, there should be enough time for a process.
As Haslach acts as a lower-level building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to provide the relevant financial statements.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and to it is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, a number of important projects have gathered, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But in the future, there are also many projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Lower Court parking lot, for example, have started.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still a theme.
The latter alone, with around 1.5 million euros, will be "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There was a great deal of room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening it could be quite flexible to respond to many things.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything is running over my table."
He can count on many years of staff in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been in the business for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been in the business for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
For continuity was important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the information of the city of Haslach, those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to have a completed study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of Architecture and have good expertise in the field of construction planning and planning.
The city building office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, basic business, management of the urban properties, urban farm with the Bauhof and the town garden, and the Lower Baurechtshof, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators start from two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bike driver had been observed near the crime scene.
"This goes far beyond a lausbubenstreich," said ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train in danger.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of the rail replacement, the pönals of the railway customers could also get to the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum was to be expected.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without any disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study says the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that are hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
In experiments, it was found that some kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a food rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less flammable intestinal environment, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal biomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal bioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
High tryptophanes in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira came forward as they please.
Matic was, however, excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and only managed to get 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have made a great effort."
Boeing "painting" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New impact for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only no fire from the party center, but no counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff of the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green Member has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has asked the abysmal Dutch Green Member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voter.
Each Twesten must return their mandate immediately, "said the Federal Executive and Electoral Head of the Greens to the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," a SPD-campaigner sigh when the new Hiobsmessage reaches the party center on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without its own government majority after the move of the Green Members Elke Twesten.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the country-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It then became the same - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a diver, the Düsseldorf-Plite was the one that killed the party in a smooth way.
In the following weeks, the comrades quickly picked up again.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis communication, he was pretty much wrong about everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in the criticism for a long time.
Mad survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps for that very reason, Weil has been trying to put more and more emphasis on the union in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin was not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They had him granted, as they promised to stabilize the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is in fact not responsible for the party-internal dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And it's not Schulz.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the repulsive parliamentarian Two.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD-Bundestag group, the German editorial network (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the list of the Dutch Greens, the Dutch Member continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag, is complaining of an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is falsifying the election result," said Oppermann.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or has been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
If you want to rehabilitate your house in the years, you can soon get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG provided information on the development of the city.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what had happened.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitating areas in the reception area.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the land of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total funding.
In the Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovation is a "success project" - it is important to also promote internal development and not only to open up new building areas.
On April 4, the Government Prize Karlsruhe received the information that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The total funding was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality of receptions.
How does a redevelopment area now arise?
You will, according to Schindler, examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, there is also a role to play, whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then move again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Länder-Programme "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The programme is based on the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per land.
The area of renovation would then be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation of the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
However, until September this year, the inventory would first be carried out in the context of which the parties to the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the statutes will be taken in order to start the renovation in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the urban maladministration and to decide when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A redevelopment note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective land.
Pietzschmann will come again after the reception and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which is, among other things, about the construction state and the redevelopment intentions.
The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet," can provide information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a housing.
The blue "operating sheet" shall be completed only if the building has business premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding in accordance with the "winddog principle" works - who comes first is first.
You could not "reserve" any funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortkern II" were shown to make the present a "tasty" redevelopment.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant process is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information that was left to the TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3: 00 on 17 July at 7: 00 in the morning for the event, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground during the time.
The records made available to TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander answered.
The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political supertones.
At the event, the President launched the reform of health reform in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to control government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as the Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But it is unusual to request their use for a photo operation only.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the president aircraft provided taxi services against the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the president aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn area to drop the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that the taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props that were presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in the issue of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press speaker, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and with the media, he was joking about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a tricky task
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The TC Blue-White Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11: 00 in Kiel at the Suchsdorfer SV table-end.
Despite five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality.
In any case, team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
I find the team very good at the rear positions. "
For class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oleen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjrerehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be hard for us as always.
That's where you need a good portion of luck. "
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the French still active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella do not make it to the Bundesliga game, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the Czech Liberec tournament, will come to his first use this season.
The so far undefeated Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could come back to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Juniors world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay will fill the cadre.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law on strengthening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his power to pass the law," Congress had put in a few "unconstitutional rules," he hated.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
It has since been a concern to investors of the local OMV, who, together with other European companies, co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line North Stream 2.
The threat is huge.
However, it was too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which of the group could resist and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is placed in the centre of the Netflix heat series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bshe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city is setting up 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's day care centres.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's day care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We have all been very pleased."
Boiled is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked refrigerated.
The city operates 46 day-care facilities in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a warm meal at noon.
In the last Kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are being treated for 45 hours a week are eating at lunch in the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food supplied, add to the salad, raw food and fruit, portionate the meal individually, spend the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the length of the hour.
"The kitchens are now part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"Thus they are much more involved and it is easier for the kite management to implement educational concepts."
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team was therefore useful.
For the children, too.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service, also the charm that it has shown in comparison with the cost of self-regulation and the provision of foreign services to the city as the most economical, it is said from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-employed.
"But these hours are not so much of a weight for around 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections to the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to a electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over the power of a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who was with friends on the Kolping road at 2: 55 a.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without the prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns about investment in the McVition factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to ensure the long-term commitment to production in its Glasgow plant by managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces other products like Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he's invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMBScotland McVitie's asked "to express concerns that the financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be advanced."
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
There have been generations of families working here, and the labour force is very much concentrated on the local community and the large Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, and in the context of the Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie. "
A speaker from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and that is the case for all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our business processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warn you about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar, after she has made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since it arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President of this prospect?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar.
Roller overthrown and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately threw a scooter in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the vehicle's clothing.
Schramberg Police, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, is asking for clues.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car was on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touched the board.
On Thursday night the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Leese.
In the area of the surrounding town of Stolzenau, a car was found on his track, so he had to move to the right.
The tour driver touched the board.
There was material damage to the car.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued its journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the driver's vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, the spokesman of the Reformation Movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret of their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the "two-measure" in the reporting of violence in the domain of the poets was measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that need to be punished and prevented in the future, but that the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and is preparing public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scarafia.
In the interview with the Bavarian radio, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and that is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beating was a very normal educational means" to deal with bad children, as I was. "
They felt it was unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on the abuse cases, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoranda "My brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was responsible for the education of the diocese of Regensburg, say?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 of the Domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were applied by Domkapellmeister R..
The punishment for the students could also be more severe, especially with high emotionality.
However, unlike many other accused people, it is clear that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even have positive memories. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he considers the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger to be relieved of the burden.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who often became easy to handle when a maple did not bring a musical top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even in it.
He is only dedicated to eight pages and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-existence or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of action.
One can at best blame him for not having taken it too late or for not taking first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also provide an excellent witness, described him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and chocolates and "was always surrounded by children's grapes."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to a number of outbursts.
The fact that he did not only hit the floor with chairs and threw the key band, but also distributed the ear figs and pulled too bad boys on his hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honour, it must be said, however, that such methods of education were widely used in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence in pre-school, these are, of course, bagatelles.
The question is whether it is not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just come to him.
Many of the Bavarian Pope, who have never understood him, are still working very hard.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also being put to the burden of any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claim to have entrusted themselves to the domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the people in question, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not ashamed.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the school students assess Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse... I don't see... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I also think it's really absurd to assume that, of all people, the boys have opened up more intrusive, more clear or rather than their parents, the head of the Internet, the teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
The report thus comes to a very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to it in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any knowledge.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the press.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these irresistible crimes, as was unfortunately the case in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violence" in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking away."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is again an abuse.
There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the nobles, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral.
All the terrible fighting education, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and painted and suffered horribly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have ruled.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with it, because he did not see the boys until they were already at the cathedral gymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
You were only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradoxical" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even have positive memories of him."
This is the only way to keep the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported about the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (according to the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he pointed out that "in the pre-school period, the sentence of the strike will continue to be applied."
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when punishments were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might have been overhauled or dramatized and where the allowed border had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the death penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
After all, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was appalling, and not to what was done in the pre-school for the infirmities and violence of innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was done at the time.
This is all very terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is, to draw ear figs and on the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of the penalty of the fight also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the nobles played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he had a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been impossible for him to form an institution of world-style, true cultural embassies of Europe and its musical tradition, from the so far known Regensburg Domspaszen (1988 and 1991), which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and chocolates alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the talks with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and I have always experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and hearty person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to a fly.
I regularly get in touch with him, as many former nobles still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly, to visit him, to read to him - he is almost blind - and to treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him so far that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the nobles today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respect person to whom they still look up today and to whom they worship.
And please, once again, quite clearly: all that is being accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since passed this time.
But it's very unfair to make a man a medial scapegoat just because he's a celebrity and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would be to let a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen at last in peace.
