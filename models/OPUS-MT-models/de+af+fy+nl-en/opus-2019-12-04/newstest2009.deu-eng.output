The Prague Stock Exchange is falling into the minus against the closure of the business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange was linked to the break-in of Monday at the beginning of the Tuesday business, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the response of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points in the course of the business day, but could later make up a part of the losses, so the decrease was reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock market in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing of the US rescue is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it would threaten that other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A massacre of American shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost $12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar break-in was last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index had a free case.
Congress is admitting: US government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial support for the American financial system.
The vote will be taken at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators achieved a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial contribution to the American financial system of $700 billion (about $12 trillion).
However, this does not mean a victory.
The members of the Congress still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said this to the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, the plan could probably be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication about the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "sobering" because of the complicated mechanisms that could be used to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like, "said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson the night to Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsold mortgage assets from the financial companies that are causing serious losses to the financial companies and which endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target, "says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
In fact, the aim is to reassure investors against business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could influence the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also a lack of clarity as to whether the last minute negotiations could not fail in a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount of aid to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at a further $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
The President has a right of veto in this decision, but Congress can overvote his veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the fact that the funds for the purchase of poor mortgage value papers, the value of which has fallen, are no longer able to repay their mortgages to hundreds of thousands of Americans.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the both-sided effort to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the Fund.
I want the Ministry of Finance to run it.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects a help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because you do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between each other, "Marek said this week to the server iHNed.cz.
In Marek's view, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not crucial.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption of the agreement is the most important at this moment, "said Marek.
Duell on Messers Cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why one should become an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the nature of the use and the claims of the future owners.
I'm sure you're hard to buy a great record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also simplified with the music on travel, that is, with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan is probably hard to get headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is sufficient space for each.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make it inconspicuous.
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the masking, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of the phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-eating people.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you make any calls from time to time, you would rather buy a charger for the office - that also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good can hold out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem exists when you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB connection, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be able to handle the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without a reduction.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most of the phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should ask for the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the comfort of the user.
If music is especially a backdrop for you and you only hear it for a short time every day in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which, in fact, almost every cell phone can do.
You also don't have to control what music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most of the devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the appropriate pages of a provider (or other provider) via the mobile Internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the service providers are poor and mostly limited to fast radio kits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
But it is generally assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of them carry the phone.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is left at home.
However, it is important whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free-call device.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The most important advantage of the music phones will be for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the light operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really be used by everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar in operation with the former normal cassette recorder or for example the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a misplaced mobile Internet and a subsequent account for data transfers.
Which device should you reach now
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But attention.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort comes to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series, are the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech service providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting for him for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers are the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTù telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some of the Czech mobile service providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight announcement.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTù) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably not find any frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators also had to respond.
Before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in the UK, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February, we reported on the start of the virtual mobile provider in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus to become the country's fifth largest provider.
The Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic has, among other things, U: fon, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually benefit as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less comprehensive service offer.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobile learning in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to set a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically directed at men.
"Real guys choose mobile - the provider that they like and that they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could take a foot in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer. "
In the Czech Republic, the mobile telephone operators mean without a chance
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobile.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
There will be more of a market entry of mobile telephony in other countries of our region, "says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile service provider has been shown for a long time by the group GTS Novera, which wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of company customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in the negotiations, "said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe we'll have better times.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specific market in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare terms with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile hardly any virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer to be able to think so in the short term. "
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider to be the best from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. "
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competitive, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
That the providers can pull on a line when it comes to something, also the long move and get over the formation of U: fon.
The most powerful pressure in the direction of ČTùwas at the time when U: fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidence of the publicly available information from the ČTù websites.
But now you: fon is the argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competition of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile telephone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services. "
However, in view of this approach by mobile telephone providers, the Czech regulatory authorities' absolute disinterest is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTù, which unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries.
This is the sole responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile operator would be possible after a contract was concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers, "said Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our question.
Such a formulation would not be surprised by the representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, ensures that no one uses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work in a normal way, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost touching agreement of the three mobile telephone providers, which is the result of their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same fuel price at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"In this case, the Authority has not found any evidence to suggest any action against competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it does not have the appropriate increased responsibility for its action on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority, "said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by ČTù, where telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the mobile phone provider, logically, has the monopoly for his network.
This means that it is necessarily dominant in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile telephone providers are acting remarkably similar.
In this respect, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera mentioned company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTù is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS dissociates from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent revision of the telecommunications law has not been able to enforce the extension of ČTù 's powers to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one looks
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, own mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile telephone providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to an end to the cooperation with the relevant society," said Martina Kemrová on our question.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing will not speak about with those responsible for the mobile telephone providers.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not give them negligible profits, but, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite the fact that the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of the customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot fully possess it like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers. "
But this alone would at least have to be strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Do the mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the supplier's statement that they do not know about it and that their terms of business would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers has led to a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their development from being virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - an too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies in particular intervened in these moments, which were not trying to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the gun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make more calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new pictures of the national anthem on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in a celebration.
The hymn was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already said to the Czech radio that he chose singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo versions.
"From the beginning, I have tried with both of them, and then with the choir, to respect a clear division, so that one can understand the text well, so that one can be consistent," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate their 175 anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first written in 1834 on the stage of the permanent theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
The Prague transport companies also carry on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers to carry an electronic coupon in their pocket will enter a subway, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can also play it on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylly, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the Internet on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used up to the afternoon hours of over four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have so far had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to the traveller, who advises interested parties to buy the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibüls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remind of the ticket value, passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon will be on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia, in particular, enter the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train crew readers are able to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation. This organisation is the one that sets up the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card reading equipment at the register with the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the opencard must be placed at a marked place at the side of the register.
In this way the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive by suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon will end, can again go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudees demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the integration of the Bohmerwald into the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is contained in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Sudetendeutschen had turned to the US President.
This is, among other things, the result of a letter that has been received in a private archive, which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it says in a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Suitors is at heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetendeutsche - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are to address a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing to the victory of the Allies," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States had doubts about the thinking of the Böhmerwalddeutsche, it would be sufficient if he were to initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naïve in today's knowledge of the post-war history, it is in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would be negotiating their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to such an opportunity at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeds.
Others again believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was brought to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The first action on safety on the streets in Czech history.
The media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš řebíček promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to get the drivers to drive too fast and get alcohol on the wheel.
And they also remind themselves to strap up before the start of the journey.
The campaign aims to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
In particular, stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a label.
And the word "pay" is in a blood laugh.
This means that one can pay attention to one's own life for a moment.
The spots will "shock" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is possible to see images with dramatic images of victims of accidents.
It is a promise that the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths will fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers
"The motto for the drivers is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when they drive in red, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "said the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, it is even less effective to draw the attention of the drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed its support for the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made in exchange with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he continued.
Deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert was in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he considered to be an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do to get the Golan heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a distance bus it is not allowed to walk around
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus from the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk on the bus while driving.
"If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the work of a steward is in conflict with the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a 20-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the road to the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment for all the misfortune next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment when the steward has coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is also equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; this was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, compared to Mütálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving when they have their seat, "he said.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of vehicle crew, but its rights and obligations do not define it, "the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka adds clearly.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue in a subsequent way.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product registration.
That will be all, "he stresses.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local transport buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says
The BESIP safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode, not many risks threaten, the situation is similar to the service on board an aircraft.
Here too, when turbulence is coming, and the stewardess can hit his head. "
"However, if a bus is a sharp brake, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal rules, "he says and also thinks that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the career of the steward is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by the travellers when they get in.
That would also reduce the cost, "he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin is responsible for the lack of stewards in his bus. However, his company only operates a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We have no stewardesses, but we are fighting from the very beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident, "he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was killed, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without blinking from the stand strip and had blocked the bus's ride.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
The two places for the stewards were sold, Jančura denies.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but it also expects a financial compensation from the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation, on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the journey, "said Fachmann Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards' activities as something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the responsibility of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest in Frankfurt
There are many words in the letter from the WestLB board to the staff of the house.
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorf Institute of Money with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgroup" could be created, it is stated in the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with a sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus to further bundling in the national banking sector.
This is what it reads when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
For the WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute, which the North Rhine-Westphalia government has just recently made clear, it is time to find a solution to the future.
As always, a link between the Deka-Bank, which is known to savings bank customers for their investment funds, and the WestLB has, however, been talking about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas has let know when presenting the six-month figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half owned by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverband, has instructed the Board of Directors to have discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just started, it is said, at the financial square.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square, is not the first time that the issue of consolidation in the savings bank sector has been mentioned.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba for a moment.
But this three-way union did not become anything.
The plans had hardly become public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
In the last place, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Helaba, had opposed the planning of a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems to be a good idea that the various houses of the public sector are in need.
Now that the country-day election is over in Bavaria, the first thing that could be done is to get closer to the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure increases to further mergers, it gradually goes out to the partners.
In the south, it would be just more junior partners, although it has so far been much better in the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who is involved in the Helaba with 85 percent, in the beginning of the year, has put forward a bar.
Blieb the North LB at best.
But such geostrategic considerations are only the one side.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit in with each other.
In June, Merl, the crucial question with which business model to ensure the future capacity of the Landesbanks, had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a disintegration of the West LB, which is not desired there.
In the letter from the board of directors there, it is also said that a "total solution" is in any case sought for the House.
How this can be brought under the same hat with the single units with the Deka-Bank, will still be shown.
The second week of the week is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, there is a massive broom that is built and shows the about 200 October-festival-traveller, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the station Puorta Nuova, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," will start this evening at 11: 45.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, on a bus only to the Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitatfeutter and a glasses with wide silver irons, belong to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10: 30.
The only way to spend the night would be to pay unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, dedicated to the Bavarian purity offer, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour management - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses are rolling into the night, on the autostrada towards "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
It will soon be quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
That's it. They're gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian signs on the 8 motorway take a break just before Munich.
Finally, when Marcos Group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese in the morning at half past 7: 00 in the morning, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cage.
On the left is "Oktoberfest," in Fracture, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conossiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the doors to the beer tent go up, it's called running!," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"The security men show that we are acting well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will be gone! "
Third: "This evening, point 11: 30 will be here again!"
And it's going to the Wiesn.
On the way a yellow cap as a road mark binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian people's party.
You want to be ready for the retreat.
It is the second week of the week known as the "Italian weekend."
There is no precise information on numbers; the talk is of 50 000 going on the way over the Alps and entering the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have travelled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a national statistics in which the Italians are first in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The court is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only in the past week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to protect itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to make up the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses with the daughter Deppa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the state financier had extremely short-term refinancing - which is no longer possible because of market misfortune.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had fallen by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current revenues and net revenues from financial operations had fallen to zero compared to the previous year's period, the revenues from the use of receivables and certain securities and the dissolution of provisions in the credit business by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the repayments of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Deppa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax rules and the business concern for group companies, the profit minus had still been moderate by around 16 percent.
After the privatisation of the former state finance company in 1990, the company had first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been broken down into the Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of money in classical state financing, the Doppa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciation that will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, is it quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since its acquisition.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending of banks is again largely over again, as the banks are harming their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs the short-term refinancing portfolio of the Deppa for a part of the year - around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate communication, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan in the foreseeable future and the company "is shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets."
It can be heard from other sources that the funds will guarantee the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute (BaFin) are expected to ensure the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group.
This is for the bank's shareholders and creditors to hope for.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the funding does not need to be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the hearing after the bank was still in the process of insolvency on the late Sunday night, the at least provisional rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price breaks down by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the borrowing prices are quite good.
If the priority debt is hardly moved, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo are concerned and, of course, the maturity beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant tightening up of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be paid in due time.
Or, however, this is what hardly anyone at the moment dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports that have been submitted in the context of the partial nationalisation, the likelihood of security has at present only become a legitimate hope.
This should, in particular, provide long-term believers with some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
In any case, short-term investors can use a final indent to make a loss statement for future tax payments on the price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone. I'm glad I didn't get lost.
The beginning of teaching at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students will join the school at 8: 00, until a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room', starts at 20: 00.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, or in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host's, including blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pulse and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language just about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been whispering, ticking and waving and I have always heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to me has been grin pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was quite stormed.
All of them were talking and ticking and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them unpacked their bentos.
My host had made me a lunch box like that - that's a little different from the old German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu.
Most of the time I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure it's all really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then makes especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the break snack.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this, too.
'Why Japan? 'my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm fascinated."
After all, I've loved to read mangas for years.
And so that I understand the comics and the culture in it better, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was completely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check that they feel the same way when they behave similar to us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge," contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers in a series to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter an inaccessible area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: she stands dead, flees or attacks.
People are similar to what some scientists are referring to a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated circuits with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic character is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, would probably differ very much from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be scientifically easier to access.
One could examine the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is more referring to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the pre-frontal cortex for the development of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I will lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activities of conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) shows memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which are primates, and in particular to the people.
With the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that feelings of more primitive activities in the body regions of the Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more concentrated on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-generational sensations.
In theory, I cannot argue with that, but I think it is inexplicable.
Pankseep argues what appears to be the case in rats and people such as fear, probably also in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave similar?
A sheep flees in danger if it also feels fear?
In my view, mere resemblance to behaviour cannot yet prove a level playing field.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and people have similar brain strains, they do not even give a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to the human being, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
How I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You might think it's short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than run into a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still a lot to do in both countries. "
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports the two hosts are behind.
The number of EM stadiums may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at the highest speed now, "said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister for Sport, Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several first ligists had been sentenced to forced descent in the last season alone for manipulation, after all, even the ligast type had to be postponed in the short term.
Empress Dennis Quaid beats back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in the interview about private - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outlawed her defiant Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He's foaming - and he's beating back.
Late Rosary War with the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had first spoken about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She had only experienced the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outings as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's amazing," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News," that "Meg, for the time being, is buying the story of our relationship and redefining it."
It is also "regrettable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so his invitations close with the sidelines: "My life goes on.
I am very happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well. "
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant fall in the second quarter.
After years of increasing prices on the hotel market, the overnight stays have already been paid for in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities studied increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course, which has led to a "declining travel lust of American tourists."
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London were more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even keep the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend was still upward in the case of air prices:
Due to the kerosene shift, travellers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-range flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the average price of economic-class airline tickets fell by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had increased by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the fall in prices was, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market bröckele.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air transport between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
It is a sign of the tense situation that the removal of unprofitable routes from airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008, were 24 in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV table guide will be.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precise, she went over his lips convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin hall of the Hamburger Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their places.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some faded actor.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and took his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded like this: give it to the gate two!
The implementation was not carried out.
"There was not all that good to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wanted it "more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) the hamburgers owe to the head ball hit by Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak gladbakers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which marked their club as class primus.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim is more for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-bound access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the jansen thrown off by FC Bayern - is slow, but not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," said Jol.
After the vote
Wall Street is about fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break in for some 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
Around 20: 30, the world's most important stock exchange barometer, with a good five percent in the minus, was recorded at 10,579 meters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares declined by just under 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
The purpose of the rescue plan is to provide the funds for the purchase of so-called faulty mortgage documents.
But the sum is to be paid out not at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from the financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of the appropriate course development in order to reduce the burden on the State Bank.
Share prices in Europe and the USA in the downward trend
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not address the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling down and it is taking the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have torn the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of the Munich real estate financier, despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, has lost over three-quarters of its value for some time, and the Commerzbank has dropped by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid clearly under the psychologically important 6000-point brand and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
All over the world, the stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion rescue package of the US government could not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock markets also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first fell by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese central index of Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 meters.
In Hong Kong, the hang-seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the central index of sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 meters.
In the MDax, Arcandor's shares were accounted for after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism companies also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been unravelling: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the soon-to-be-freezing fuel lines, you are now at risk of cold death.
Among scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years: the missiles do not behave 100% as they would be expected under the old-fashioned gravitational law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction, whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, however, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter, after all, represents a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were taken to Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were supposed to have been killed.
In the south of Egypt five Germans have been kidnapped.
I want ransom negotiations to run.
Over and over again, Germans come into the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Rumanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: the kidnappers were, according to an Egyptian security officer, ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when "this surprise" suddenly came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had requested a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling for a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill herself, has been reported to a court.
Michael Treise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after standing up to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Trial Court in Truro found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
In a confession, Treise wrote, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Mrs Randle was killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Treise had tied her up and tied her eyes before he did sexual activities while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time on an voluntary basis, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to have killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession, which ended in this way: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't force her to be sexually.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so. "
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would have been a very promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Official responsible for lost data is charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged with the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two very confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be addressed internally by the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the Metropolitan Police should charge the official with the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was taken by his house to a secret place.
Housing companies are looking at B & B costs
British housing companies could have more than 80 million pounds in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are cancelled.
But the interest in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted in a prudent way are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted in a prudent way during the upswing are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are two-sided organisations without members, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will be five pence per litre of more expensive
The people in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting company have been carried out.
The retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused to have bail on the charge 50 million Taka ($729.700) blackmailed by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government should first give it full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their arrest was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of their release, whether they will be able to continue to be free when they return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail because it says that it does not have to receive a deposit, because it is already on suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court. "
Your lawyers claim that they need security to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, said an Awami Alliance party president on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Afraid of the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise to not attack or obstruct the thousands of people who are carrying out the vaccination.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB prepared doubts about the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communication Office have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US State Department
The American Attorney General has appointed a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the USA in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report was critical of the officials of the White House, legislators and the former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said the general inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice took nine US prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleges, which led many observers to consider the dismissal to be politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of democratic electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be withdrawn for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been under fire for the redundancies and has finally set up his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also quit.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector has made a critical reference to the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, "giving up its leadership role," and showing itself "unusually disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award."
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize during the award next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's award after it has been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice that was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Day, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heart attack after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
It was later known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repatch Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would like to repatch the small street and set up seats for a café that the company would like to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost alley and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the Punkrockmonument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is probably most known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, ramps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the blogger, who write about the genetic trification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Appeals: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published a part of the conversation of the city's history of Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even stays dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain rings."
With a few exceptions, the road was just as recently seen in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothing business is located.
Graffiti was shown on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far on the floor from a fresh set of outsourced newspapers.
Some passers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Discussion on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch," Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a leading scientific assistant in California studies and director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
To speak to the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completion of the school by Afro-American and Hispanic students is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Let's take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have just been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, the state audit in Mathe was a good level of 100 percent of fourth-class students.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were considered good in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved using different methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street school focuses on the review and exercise, on the constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate any exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point Obama is supposed to take into account, according to the school manager Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and can no longer recognize it.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's services would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agreed that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation that is aimed at "only English."
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take care of educational models that work instead of despising and trivialising them.
The price of oil is falling as a result of the new fears of the economy
The oil price fell strongly on Monday because of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The oil futures at the New York trade fair fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong whirlstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, this month they fell to almost $90 per barrel, then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were already concerned again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the very last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to raise the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption down due to the weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 have been reduced by 20%.
Team record set up by series in the second quarter
In the last eight and a half years, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all more often than anyone else in the Jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a result-free game into a triumph train.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a slampy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in line with the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns that slipped out one time as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't get very hard on myself," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
The outside defender, Darrelle Revis, took off a lost throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had taken the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
The two of them answered, for in the third quarter the jets allowed 21 points without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time. "
Extensive gebrselassie beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 km line in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one World Championship title or a world record on every line from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left out the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear that the air pollution might worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the Berlin competition.
In almost ideal conditions - in the case of the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - braselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya on long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was unable to train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and didn't come back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great. "
He was criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for overorchestrating his races, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if that was a railway race, and putting world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of gebrselasies as long-distance runners.
accompanied by four Kenyan on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the line in 1: 02: 04.
Two elites from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge gebrselassie after the Temmacher had left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last move to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh most successful result of all time with 2: 19: 19.
The world record of 2: 15: 25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and to improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She was planning her course in a good way, leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to be enough, but after 30 kilometers she was overtaken.
Askale Tapa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and the stratagem in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the evolutions of the amusement parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic activities, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown houses, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that describes it - and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of the depression by the Federal Writer's project - is in many respects a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is so independent, healthy and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he is missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential audience, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many are still tired of being watched by the outside world.
"We are very much concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the community of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true. "
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and attentive.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Floridariseführer changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
He was the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"aside from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white modern school, with its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man from Wiwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever-always fits the hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said Ella Dinkins, 90-year-old, one of the Johnson girls, immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people did not like it."
They still remember Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into the city, she did it mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that even today is a little bit of a bit of a way to feel in her own decent clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swirled in his chair, on a back-facing terrace that looks at the Sabelia Lake, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken away.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a time-force of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial, no public readings in the big style.
"I do not think that they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbow," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial blending brought hatred to the community.
"In this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car. "
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "offensive rather than respect for my race."
People today say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group concentration in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - by hugging their teacher in the morning and hugging their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, adding it until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You did not embrace your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri.
However, the civil rights have helped to create space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who have gone beyond prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelves, and made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance road inspired the city, accelerated the whole at the top speed, aroused real civil pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more people came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to revalue the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represents black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that their hidden community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was born.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other group of races and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or in the police, who, according to him, might need some help.
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, there's a fluent talk of financial Latin.
At first sight, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not know that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror day of the day since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal teas along the pavement and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still leaning between apartments around, like human packaging animals loaded with the 50 curved T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like bar on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on their own on the steps of the citizens and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 4: 00 and 7: 00.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all, until Thursday afternoon, because of all the world's downfall, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the money switches to collect or deposit money, but at the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," stood for the same reason I was a snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places where they were commuting from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had raised money from so-called Thrifts (a little bit like a building park bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, and say that they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone silent and quiet.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of facilities, went into bankruptcy over and over the weekend as the last Friday, Wachovia, another bank that has savings worth $440 billion, was in search of a saving buyer.
In the fear of a further collapse, the office and shop workers who were standing before me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
In the last few weeks, very normal New Yorkers have applied for financial Latin.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese corporate supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the broke-down bank and its defamed-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block of living, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not taking any more risk."
Muslemic tombs shaved during right-wing in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing liberal party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization."
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is shown, painted with a red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of the burial in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extremely right parties, of significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Graveyard in Traun near Linz in an action organised by the police.
The perpetrators were spying Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officers think this is an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the message of the disgust that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is tilting to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria, after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties that received almost 30% of the votes, committed themselves in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their constitutions were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was in favour of a ban on headgear and burkas and even made his dislike against food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme rights are the most politically powerful block in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star, who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter imposed a six-month lock after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted the opportunity to impose a foreign travel ban last Thursday, after providing the judges with evidence of Glitter's premonitions for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Ein Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the police asked Kent at the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person. "
As required by the sex offenders register, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said it would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A speaker from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kents and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew to and from Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the United Kingdom.
Finally, he arrived on 22 August at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to be able to demand that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the Master behind the stage to hold his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no buns, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who do not have the concentration and are dedicated to the interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamencode representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing ever greater from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer will notice that there are no typical pictures of artists on the stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
In order to be able to hold on to the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character is in her hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamenco-stars with the camera. '
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images that remind of classical photography were created.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and is surprised every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthropology of the Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as' portraits of the veterans of sport '(' SportARTproject ').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives it to 'I like to photograph people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a long time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco of today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is shown in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is currently writing is' a great bravery '.
He does not yet know where the action of the novel is taking place and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is dealing with is' a bravery 'and' everything points to the fact that he does not have to write the novel '.
"If I were to be considered, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point," so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and the majority of the people present gave her voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything: how his call to literature was made from 'extraordinary adventure', 'joy of reading' and 'more than before'; how he writes and 'discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and overwork, which he is influenced by the memory of the people who are the people who are the people of the city and the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people of the people who are.
The Hispanic American novelist admitted that there is' no way 'to measure and how to know whether books change life,' but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience ', Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is' causing effects' and 'bringing people apart', therefore I asked the writers' not to leave themselves to ease 'and' take responsibility 'for his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: the bulls were partially out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus the feast was exposed to the irresistible weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which was why the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El July, which went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After having tried so badly, most of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh-calling.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, so they took the escape.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and the forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the authorities of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the routine control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometres. At the moment the drivers got out of the car to escape through a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundles to other police services.
In addition, the officials found that the license number was' double ', so it did not match the license number indicated in the car documents, which is why it was also arrested for the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to make the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. arrested was brought to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she was trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, the traffic police of California reported the magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear 'after 4: 30 was pushing gas pedal and making a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking lot, and when she was driving backwards, she caught her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably had not known the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was "afraid of Lockbears."
When the police strike came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street and thus blocked traffic.
'She seemed to be unoriented ', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was excluded from the first moment. 'As a result of the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and was taken to a local investigation facility at around 7: 00.
Two months ago, after treatment from the Arizona clinic, Locklaer was released, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left should be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it," Llamazares pointed out what approach the party has to take to the one who has so far been a city council in the Seville City Council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory violations that Silva may have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education 'has a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by 'Epidios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' is the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in film photography, with about 15 million euros of investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineau has tried to 'represent a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, said Carci today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the Telemadrid station as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that, thanks to this filming, his' childhood dream 'was fulfilled. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. In particular, because the story was based on' Episodios Nacionales', which took the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight because the people had been put back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on the funding as in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked with almost his entire career, could not be made.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', was involved by his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you must first rehearse before you start to turn and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared to be 'humiliating' and to give respect, 'part of the film director's career is to help in the theatre and in the cinema, to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many of the actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he won), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish film graphy. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and, finally, not the selected film 'Los girasoles cigos'.
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for the offspring, later you realize that it's just for the time being, and now you're happy to have produced another film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville admits a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalucia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women fighting for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and was in favour of the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me."
'We are not trying to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit, 'said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
"The dance of the butterfly" seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or "the dance of the snake" like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area ', she claims.
The production is expected to have two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-master Matilde Coral, who, for example, wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
"Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honored. '
The production also expects musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes on the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he always fell in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in so far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who has an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works today no one knows more and for that reason even less to appreciate her," says Bayón.
The show will take place today at 20: 30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón married Jiménez in 1916, offers an atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two days of the death.
For example, 'the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council of Culture also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', which were published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can misimagine without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
This sentence was written by the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and by the then ruling idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed her.
Look what it took her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
But that was a big blow for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford weeping, "my life and my country were the greatest trifles of his life."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment when there was fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, where the American self-esteem that was set down is in the hopeless search for reasons to restore dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people who can be admired remain, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like various losses both profits: from the foundation that committed itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose, up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to fight a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder suggests to take home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of us has left us all," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who today trust to try to live like Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of justice, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He was married to Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many ways to not be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?" he often made fun of himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the one of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the one of the philanthropist, 'they say.
The streets in Madrid are poor for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, "Are we prepared for this?"
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called a perfect street, and according to my assessment, it was the worst road in the world.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, it would clearly not have been possible to do so.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticking that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the congestion on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided only to buy small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had been successful, but it would be more difficult to get it back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting time it looked like rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I got, I can think the outcome was misstamped.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, that road would never come to my mind.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but which is able to do some primitive tasks, such as order a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also place the people present after the talks in the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' noticed a third person, but she understands that this person is not related to the group that leads to her conversation, and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficial about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some feature in Windows versions and 'extras'.
The change of direction is worth
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sent many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his' death ', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'windows' environment.
What does half of the computer of existing applications do?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Light, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services, which can then become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I bring a small example of that.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshment drink machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It expresses a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used to search the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we start to list the countless star appearances, we can take back the image of a very strong man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, breathless and waisted.
The English language calls it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the name development is connected to sport and comes from the Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'surrounds everyone because of his excellent cotton, because of his distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail at the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as a undergarment.
You're very attractive.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't care about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joy.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, then moved to her place of residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, the winner on the short lines.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentine's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the 50's and 60's cinema; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women get dressed, and they combine their clothes, and I do that a lot.
dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is meeting in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was a little girl, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to roam in my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real actor role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've recently become 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because that's what my body wants, and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about that.
I will give my child a great feeling of happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep an eye on the work you took part in and were shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which can't be right away.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you were on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's all right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our Mango collection were auctioned to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can get back due to the level of alcohol, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the level of alcohol installed this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken condition. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General Prosecutor. According to her, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for the redevelopment of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers, who were shown more than once for driving under alcohol influence, were again in tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air that has been exhaled and prevents car start when the driver has made an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is determined that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the cost is borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices already in the first year after its introduction prevent up to 65% of the regulatory infringements.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it became a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out by the usual means, and yet a reform of the basic law is called for, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5: 40 am, at the time provided by the programme, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias travelled.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced the hand to use as an umbrella to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of night.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting at the airport's hangar and at the red carpet, also military protection from 27 Navy soldiers who give the honorary salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair drawn by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected to be a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reporter on Mexican television who likes to make fun of them.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much more excellent fashion designer and Bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ².
The biggest store is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because his brother recently died, got together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and put on some of the jewelry of ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of Red Shield without Jackets, because they borrowed the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who hastened to the business and had a pants and a shirt that she modelled herself, and for dinner she was wearing a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a bar and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sagre, did not follow the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but a way to forget about the chaotic life of our daily lives.
And if there are a few, they are all gathered in a book in which it says how to relax. The book comes in the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7: 00 in the morning, but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn off from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than until 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the rest that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, so this manual repudiates such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or to propose the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you have spoken at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, links are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bed wet at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress or overload.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite a opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to be advised by a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and in this way comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnea or with the stress).
What you can do is do a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to upset the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
It helps the child to sleep.
When speaking in sleep occurs, try to keep the peace.
Remember that it's harmless to the child and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it's sleeping, so it's resting.
Remember, if it is scared after a couple of manifestations, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that, therefore they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses... finally
After a long thirst line, Illhuis on the field is finally on a success course again.
Without a great effort, the yellow-black played a large number of goals and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers had a hard time showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose distance was just past the angle, Illhuis should dominate the game with ease, and it was then possible to make a funderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi pass through at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two torches fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately after that with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was exactly right to take back a ball that had been rejected by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the illhäussian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so his team comrades had to continue to play in numbers.
However, Denmark did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an Ilhaesian elf, which only withdrew a little to 'seal' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen, who on Monday blocked the access to several Breton and Normandy ports, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive it 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that it will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Committee on the Crisis, set up by the Breton fishermen, to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon ', the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again, and to secure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led the Morbihan and Calvado's protest marches, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometres in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon Peninsula was bordered by a barrier.
On Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing kutter did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue ', because' the fishermen will not give in at any point 'and' do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes were the first to say goodbye to the film legend and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintained its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider making more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times' Sunday issue, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering making more than 15% of its assets, in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were advanced to it.
AIG is prepared to direct the sale of a large part of its business, beyond their international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
In the case of AAG, the Commission considers that it is not possible to assess the impact of the aid on the Union industry.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
On Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks, the New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of the courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of about 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final score, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, fell by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Representatives, which was to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been launched at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the Members refused to grant the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"Here a bad picture is being put into circulation, which represents Congress as unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market was counting on this plan, 'she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be' too late '.
'If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the Fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. d.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit the credit conditions even more ', warned Brian Bethune, head of the business at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza, while stressing the feeling of extreme urgency, stressed that 'every day that passes, brings the ruin of a financial establishment' in the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the bank business of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing 'not only an American but a global crisis', the analyst of the FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the State Bank within ten years has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who was the winner of this, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel in the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats, which should be followed by one third of the American families.
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although it was quite remarkable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his fall in election issues five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published a five-point opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
In the case of the still undecided voters, that is to say those on which it is now important, Obama came out of the polls with 39% as a winner, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his head start on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain did not stop to focus on his undisputed experience in the field of foreign policy, and clearly to emphasise the 'naivety' of his opponent in the field of these issues, which were the centre of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," he stressed several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise way, without being taken out of the version.
He took his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
"McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already," this weekend a democratic campaign against the fact that Republicans were accused of not capturing the complete scale of the crisis that is being put on the 'American off the road'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday 20,000 people who had gathered in the rain of a North Carolina election event.
He did not even mention the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss.
"The next week could be a decisive turning point," yesterday the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
After he had once again stressed that he would probably even manage to reduce the taxes on 95% of the Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a 45-power plant by 2030.
The two candidates were concerned about the questions that were raised on the plan to save the financial market of over $700 billion (€470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk? '
The young and the opposition demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians have gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the electoral centre on the market square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light in order to resume negotiations with the European Union is prepared to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count," said Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and in our case that is the executive.
When Members of the opposition move in to Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the number of votes was too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a election has taken place?, the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, the ones who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night falls again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Discussion - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has recovered the public's trust, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the light of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation in February 1994, led by the Judge Horace Kever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Kever was still reluctant to report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood reserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Kever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conserve system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood reserves and by working in this area in the following years, we have recovered public confidence ', she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
'And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we were looking at one of the main guidelines of the reports of Kever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied, if one does not know this and if a disease only slowly progresses, as is clearly the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technology for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the donor to prove the presence of the virus directly in the blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it and not being able to recognize it was significantly reduced.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving blood infected with HIV.
In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood reserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transmitted via a blood conserve.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, "says the director of Hema-Quebec.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can get into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus was found on the island of Réunion, which, just like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously ', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient care in addition to a safe supply.
"The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of the population of Quebec that is suitable for blood donation. '
In doing so, any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the criteria of suitability can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who make their blood available are not accepted, for example because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from the blood donation for one year.
'With these 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
The lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate blood anymore.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that one rarely finds the time to spend an hour in the donation of blood ', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood conserve, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart flaps, eyelashes and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nebula blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered a biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousands of umbilical blood samples, and we plan to take over a thousand a year.
"We should probably start at the beginning of next year to provide it for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical blood collection as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals in Quebec.

The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both one and the other, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who got in the way of Matt Jordan for the sounds.
Let us remember that at the first game of the pre-game and replay series on Friday, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had brought a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattles.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit with a 4 to 3 win in the back game in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
The impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - victory through Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good. '
He was too much on it in the first half of the day, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. "
Chest places on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's subelection.
'Move the course of our last major border in the north ': this is the long-term objective that Jean Chest presented yesterday with visual means to the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources as during the election period.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out the fact that he was going to hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was' a jewel with enormous potential ', but did not mention a date, no investment amounts or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At the most, a few views on what could be more worked on: in particular, on water, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, it is supported by the growth of the emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Chorests, the north has' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This' area twice the size of France 'is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is in us', he stressed how to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future 'he added after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister explained to the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments have pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time if the opportunity is to be given to me to take this position again on behalf of the government ', he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he said and talked about the northwest passage, which will be possible all year round because of the ice melting.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist Member of Ungava) have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers, led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
the plan North will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
'Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have changed our mind to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised issues of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's taking over of the party's leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant into Adélard Godout dam.
"From Godout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lessay, who reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," said Jean Charest.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative project, the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Chest stressed that it was intended to be launched in 2012.
"This remains between us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted his party members, which caused the incident.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, indeed has the opportunity to hold a choice this autumn, which is not yet possible for him by the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, mainly because of a mission from the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, in particular 'the objectives of the Constitution', which were easily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'special nature of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has taken up the guidelines of the Nord plan with scepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has relaunched the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs Marois, along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), judged Francoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a plan for the North by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Poulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr Vic Toews, former 'Justice' Minister (which irony) in the Harper cabinet, was the one who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only government in all the countries concerned, did not bring home its countryman, who was caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that were accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and allowing a child soldier to go on under inhumane conditions.
The only one who can go down to a court parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that in particular UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home to get a fair trial in Canada.
This government is also close to the eyes of torture: it does not interest them much that after so many years of pain a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are now experiencing a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying like a flag, and that sounds so non-saying from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and lock a Canadian citizen, in the best sense of a head of government who is still only supported by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has disagreed with what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The English speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director-General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold-winning society sought a slander of over six million against three authors and a small, medium-term publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they judge not the truth, especially in the case of slander, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin, who dares to represent one of their opposite views.
No matter how the process ends, the authors and the editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic of these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that makes the opposite to death and also frightens anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is and is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by the cutting of the knot.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, while disrespecting the views of the public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President only covers the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slander have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is prepared to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many see as a nudity (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's action is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth-finding that are fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known to be able to control debates and inconsistencies and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate action clearly shows that, in contrast to what it says, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30's.
The new version of the plan of over $700 billion, which is to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congresses.
The main content is: a better control of the Member States on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of houses held due to payment delays, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat said.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous, 'said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a new failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, were more in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction at the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those designed to enable the owners to keep their houses and those relating to the salaries of the senior employees of the companies saved by the State.
'If the taxpayers are asked to take exceptional measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, it is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary, 'he said on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guidelines that I have read show that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we can progress.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, 'he said.
The 700 billion-dollar plan is aimed at the money of the taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the collapse of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of the risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before it extended to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally resulted in the freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies in distress should only be secured and not bought by the government, they believe they are going to escape the dead end.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, a decision has also been added, which states that if the government with this programme should make losses within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies that bring dividends to it in the case of profits, and that can sell it again when the storm has moved forward.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to suspend the detention procedures for the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set time limits for the repayment and the payments paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Representatives to vote on him already today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes were taken yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
"Obviously Washington does not understand us," said the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is asking the taxpayers to the cash register.
The democratic Member, Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasus of the Skeptics', represents things differently but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which way to go ', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US $16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank announced BNP Paribas that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In order to compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now that unsafe times are coming to light. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British Government was just about to nationalize another bank that was in trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($77.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK Bank's branches and customer accounts.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sense of affinity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he was like, and for a long time he was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his play, and certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Missing blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
Its European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him, a whole country was reflected, in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was injured in the war in the Pacific, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had a success at the theatre, on TV and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for the civil rights, was also the driver who became the second in the 1979 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in an exemplary fashion with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and over-sensitive stars to the glamour of the show business will also disappear, whose riddles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans put the cinema owners in Taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
The charming cowboy again comes to mind from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot roof, which was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter recollection (1990) is being brought to light, the one of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, at his high age, is disturbed by a wedding that did not meet all of their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable Boxer Rocky Graziano from Some Body Up There Like Me (A hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was taken back after his death and the Newman made it known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the superior The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his resume, epochs unite.
The young man knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinemas who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, and in doing so, tell Hollywood, his fortune, his prank and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without a sense of humor, as a living challenge to 'underplay' when he assessed his too expressive performance.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles for a long time only flew.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, feislings or desperate, with the perfect representation of which he reflected his distraction and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian woman Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a fine-minded women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of affection and sadness.
In the flood of honors that struck Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Greatness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the abyss of Hollywood, is now going down.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and this is considered quite flawless, even though we thought it was still funny at the beginning.
The profits from his sales were still in need of his foundation for children.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. "
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrow and the broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of supplement & amp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János's supplement and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participation in organised crime, as well as gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document counterfeiting.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds from the calls for tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with false invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - should have been part of the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, part of the private funds of individual banks.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender fees were received, and the associations were not supposed to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills are supposed to have been forged.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on the tour north of Lake Plate, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lado should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on the consumer situation in order to be able to later issue invoices on the basis of these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices are to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András Şri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lado's "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by the company and the company in 2003, the restaurant company is expected to have occupied the nine-year-old group of the Biztos Pont Egisulet association.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than 10 people at the same time, 130 guests are to have stayed.
The imagination of the falsifiers was also not set any limits when it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the indictment, did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the public prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company was supposed to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong after they had a total of 11 rooms that could not be so many people.
It was also mentioned on the invoice that the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The large-scale counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they are looking for, offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigation, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kf. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company only calculates 15 percent of VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
A further error that had been made to the "accountants" was that in a case of "goods transport" they had indicated as a performance, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed it.
Furthermore, it was due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egissulet and Biztos Pont, were exposed as forgeries.
The same in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors were responsible for never issuing the bills.
Another "error" is to the falsifiers at the HIB Kf. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in resolution at the time (2001) just when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egysület was eating there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accounting officers are people who were well aware that they had to make fictitious accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Stiftung Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the CEO of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
The currently in liquidation biogas Kf. is also supposed to have worked with a supplement and co.: In 2003, the GmbH was to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the clubs Atlasz Egisület and Vörösfenyő Egisület with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which were related to non-performance.
However, there was also no payment, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, but the parties had forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall include persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based, but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF of about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has been a buyer of these invoices.
The manager of this company was a rumena to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, in the course of the investigation, Kubatov has been able to issue invoices on behalf of GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and to have collected their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian maurers on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies was active, which according to the defendant was in lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Scene, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the total amount of the accounts and the value added tax.
Kubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were settled to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forint each, but these amounts have been used in a foreign way.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictional invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kf...
These invoices were, by the way, secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some of the defendants to state a confession about the conduct of the falsification of accounts, as they were already filed before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János's award was to decide on a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report on everything on several occasions, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the recovery of the large part of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the contract in return is prepared to take over the responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the addition now plays the "insulted" after his requests for relief of detention and house arrest had come to deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid them, are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overassess the offer.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even overpriced prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lotto, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were studied by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to gain money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain bark, was measured in the case of the auction losers, in which the overoffering of the opponent plays a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out research into the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they were the winner of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis was on the one on the winning, while the other was on the losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were prepared to do more than those in the control or "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have, in fact, only been the reasons for the behaviour observed in auctions with the joy of winning or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready - "said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the University of New York's Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in the country is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the liver viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as semen, paraphermal secretion or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two-three weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and rashes.
After that, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B-induced, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person is in medicinal treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it may lead to cirrhosis of the liver and cancer of the liver.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destructs the liver cells inadvertently - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, prevention, such as regular control tests, is essential in time.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
As the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, which will eliminate the risk of infection and prevent the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organised by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver infection caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Are believers less in pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith is like a kind of "painkillers," which should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it has been examined to what extent faith in God affects the sense of pain of man, the British sheet "Telegraph."
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks, while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to take out most of the pain.
With the help of a brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
When the test was done, the subjects were connected to the left hand with a sparkling device that gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they chose the image of Vincent, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was considered to be calming.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should look at either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for," and they had felt "peace and peace."
During the consideration of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, strong-acting images with the atheists, you just had to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find a picture that makes very positive sensations, like a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains which effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can say with the right hand: it is in people's pockets as well as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which professionals they go, and what they move.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, which are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: they would simply overlook the essential part of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main objective of Google was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original objective of "arranging all the information in this world."
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still at the start of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet search the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which the search was made, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search process and to use it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is based on the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the users are wondering what happens in the event of an abuse of data - "When you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which is a source of fear, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the appeal against the power that many Internet users have to reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event of investment, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the Community side called "Orkut," and also enabled the identification of the paedophiles.
However, for personal rights, users were able to breathe up in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: in the future, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search list, has been withheld retroactively for two months.)
Google's image remains controversial: those who do not like to issue their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere by using Google's services, the company is teasing with the outrage that is due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is a leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require any identification codes to its users, unlike Microsoft, and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problem of the relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been at the centre of the process, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
In fact, the "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, users are deliberately leaving traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average young person can manage his profile at the same time on several community sports - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with each other by means of other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally include all this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that are the latest photo galleries that are automatically located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove that, when looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is being released because in his blog he is only too honest about his problems about corporate management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who live an online life are what they reveal of themselves - so one could perhaps formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, does not intentionally leave any trace.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords / AdSense are threatening the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the more and more rapidly introduced services are not only preparing Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the worrying counterpoles: for example, the group management rejected a protest of the employees completely after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple food of the employees was too expensive. However, all this seems to be quite mild against Google even going to the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical results, or those who would be in breach of the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules say that in advance no new service will be applied for, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could again be a lot more serious: while some believe that Google's book and magazine or archiving project is now assuming that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "health" system that allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already supplies the fabric - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorov describes a future in the best Orwelle manier, in which a human being, thanks to Google-related data, becomes terrifying.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the removal of trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of being involved in the removal of the tracks, the spokesperson of the Police Commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were tidy and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is under threat of imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of his own money.
In the course of the investigation it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech kroner, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made, despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15" the offer of the Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, a number of leading European pages already spoke of "second 11 September."
The global financial disaster is due to the American President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to get his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11."
Parts of the press in Madrid also find the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the danger is that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva says "day-indicator."
While some states could still provide their money institutions with rescue packages, and save the banks from bankruptcy with the taxpayers' money.
However, if a dominant effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States should jump above their shadow and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out of weak money institutions, the Wiener "The Standard." In addition, the newspaper said, the concerns are increasingly realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers would now have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is now raging over the old continent like a tsunami.
While the "rescuers" would not have to "wager" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to attack taxpayers' money in order to prevent even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan an amazing project was presented, which inspired the Nissan engineers of humming in the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system, which is controlled by car robots, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private" area, which is very similar to our own "protection shield," Kazuhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately starts the conflict-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds of break, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to be in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the evisceration cannot go down, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the weatherability of the tyres.
While the bees are here infinitely open to the possibility of avoiding other bees, the researchers could only use the motion of the car, or the acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh said that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device must only process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous maneuvers, so that it always only uses a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate conflict prevention technology, which Nissan is estimated to be in production as standard over the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the drivers around obstacles and leading them to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and will aim to purchase the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time in the East Coast, the members of the Congress, after several days of debate, have reached an agreement on the 700 billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, it was not a question of saving Wall Street, but of ruining the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington time Sunday night 8: 00 (Central European time Monday 2: 00 in the morning), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 draft law on economic stabilisation, and then the Senate will be next.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the 700 billion dollars should be spent on the purchase of faulty securities with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-bearing, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the next $100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision by the Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-charged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made in an auction as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and the companies pay the expected damage charges.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks that have been in difficulty and are now on the verge of state aid can expect to be reduced by the government in the overseas Slang salopp "Golden Handshake."
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the served bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the failed loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers' salaries are not overrun.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in management salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains the right to participate in the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers falls, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the saved bank get better.
The draft law provides that the President will have to submit to Congress in the next five years a proposal on how to get the taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says the California Republican, Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9%.
Export prices were 1.1% higher than those in July 2008 and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
In terms of domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
The domestic sales prices have only increased slightly, i.e. by 0.1% compared to the previous month.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased very little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices for chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
A fall in the price of crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent) was observed.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the main domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
In terms of the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry, the prices of crude oil processing have increased most (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, drink and tobacco was 11%.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
The highest price increase in the investment goods sector was recorded on the domestic market in August (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3%, while in the energy and further processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8%) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
Sectors producing consumer goods have seen a price increase of 6.8%, while the price of fixed assets has been reduced by 1.4%.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, but in the year-on-year comparison there was a decrease of 3.9%.
The domestic currency was weaker than the euro by 1.7 percent, and the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 price, it was stronger by 7.5 percent and even by 15.9 percent compared to the euro.
No more visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in the overseas area in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
She meets Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also has talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, agreed on Sunday to support the $700 billion rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After daily marathon discussions on Sunday morning, the Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the fading up of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of the Vice-President's candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted there at the same time.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We need to act now, and that is responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, the whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet."
In an interview given to the ABC station, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time (...) but no one is an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also required the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the handling of top managers - something he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the representative of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution is destroying their fathers."
According to the renowned politologist, the CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian social partners have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU was not quite surprising, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
For as long as ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, and therefore fell under the 50 percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation of the CSU in the Federal Republic has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at a very fast pace, it was very much appreciated. But the secularisation, the educational success, the access from East and North Germany to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without the impact of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by increased options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and independent.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree, such as university degree.
Here the support of the CSU fell to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diesse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily reports in their "Who with whom? Party leaders held back in coalition issues" articles about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the involvement of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussion in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to set up a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look at.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as a vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molterer course.
A repeat of this direction would not be possible.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is now completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ESDP.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities was launched, which is now being organised by the EU Presidency-in-Office of the Council, France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, in particular, drew attention to the segregation of education, as it is one of the most serious legal violations that is happening to Roma children, and it is also the biggest obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the Fidesz press office reports, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be forced out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can get a higher education."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Member, it is important that these links become as broad a circle as possible - that is, Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts the school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segmented education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of deregulation in the education sector, in order to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities."
CSU: grace on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, at times no heads are rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in their offices, the question is only how long this grace will last.
The fate of tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of voice is decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party day.
The much-organized duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
They want to soften the angry group and the party base, which called for personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was a "single government" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
While the Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Elector," exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition.
The irony of fate is that with the list "Free Electors" that Gabriele Pauli comes into the dictatorship, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the target politician without any mercy.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its powers on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far taken the strings out of the background, will be given an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU President, on 28 September, called the "most bitter day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous comments towards CDU - in his view, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not to be relaunched with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a fuss of her disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that the loss of the terrain of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the S & Ds is going on.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition member made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD is suspected to be a violation of the law when counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million people has been without opposition for decades. However, the opposing party, which was gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who was already renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would "allow" some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
Therefore, the ODS has even removed from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on the rise in the prices of the natural gas imports of Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans have been received, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition's expectations, it was hoped that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians had been banned from entering the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided for temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - that is, the opposition should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set for free, for example, and Minsk is even ready to make smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognise the independence of the abyss Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has seen the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let only one opposition into Parliament."
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are facing many problems here - the opposition newspapers need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of the distribution of stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," - said Milinkevich, in an example, that not even the most-supported layer of the pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the" social security "which is based on the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Community of Independent States Mission, said to the news agency Ria Novoti, "People believe the actions and not the words." The lack of opposition was therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you'll have breakfast before work."
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the officials.
From now on, the measure will come into force against those smart people who will first stamp and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism, "Brunetta points out again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is now no breakfast during working time; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7: 00 is a miracle."
During a meeting of the High Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superior della Pubblica Amministrazione)
the Minister of Rome announces that "within three months, the absence of officials has reduced to 50%, that is to say, 60,000 more people per year are present at work."
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta decree in the framework of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is profiting with figures on lower reductions in work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faggot' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil service officials have come together to declare war on the unlawful standards of the decree. "
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related disease; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
There are 2500 accidents at work every day in Italy, three people die and 27 remain incapacitated for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data that Anmil has distributed and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention at work," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to job prevention, to the protection of injured workers, to aid to the families of the victims and to the awareness of public opinion."
"An outraged" Basta "has risen to this; it is understandable in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some of the vertebrae in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested in education and information."
The many initiatives for a more direct awareness of school frameworks by young people who feed the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be put in place and improved.
In turn, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards determined rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the fact that the number of deaths caused by work is far too high," says President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" positive trend "to mean less attention. This is what is causing the tragedy in the end."
"How to believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, greater controls and inspections are necessary - according to Mercandelli, but also more measures to inform the workers who are already beginning in school. "
"A further effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers is needed towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency. "
Mercandelli also insisted on "the progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music equipment, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This reports to the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report, as it says in a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music equipment for at least five years a week longer than one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music equipment and mobile phones on a high volume, will not be able to damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - as the European Union says - show a clear risk that is pressing for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise the awareness of consumers and to make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology. "
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - the EU Communication - confirm that one is quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard at the moment, which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB.
The damage can be very limited, in which one can reach solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that when users of portable music equipment hear music (more than 89 decibels) only five hours a week, so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum sound level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This was therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, it is to be over in March, and it is to be taken into account in June.
This is the course of the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" set by the Capitol. The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Therms.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and municipal council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor of the city Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - Alemanno points out. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains for the city and the community council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be finished and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a time-specific end point.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission. "
Those who call into question the Commission's competence, as their opinion was not binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind, so that in a deeper perspective we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city. "
The mayor of Rome is very important to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - to take a common step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, who "will not only be limited to the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as the capital of the city and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much to be considered independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man). "
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami has written in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! "
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great lead.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the electoral cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which was kept hidden until the last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide who we will make our cross for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information relating to those responsible.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, that is, the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It is a problem that needs to be solved - so the interviewed journalists - if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is now a reality for the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive senior press members believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executive is even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the way the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are on the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, in the hope "they bring something good for journalism."
The biggest crack in American journalism is today between the editor-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of the head editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "safety in work."
The managers who are afraid of losing their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors," Anm. d.) is always an up-to-date topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers like it are popular and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors get very high wages very often, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros a month, including pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, are often "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME REPORT: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request, which had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl..
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such a transfer (against which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to get evidence that was indicting him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the run-up dissects the Republican Party, which is becoming more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and the neoconservative one that is "hostile to those in Washington" and the financial world, and, in other words, wins voters in the south and center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of what I mentioned above.
However, this example, which has just been mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is or is already being announced: not only in the United States, also in the whole of the West, and perhaps even beyond it, will be affected by them.
In both the States and Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad, while at the same time managing a huge amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears to be global in economic terms, but it is almost purely national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to have come to an end and lost its right to speak: the EU has given the obvious proof of this, which, because of its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, more importantly, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without any foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions - under certain circumstances - which will otherwise not be able to use an international organisation and a market in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that is recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
It is a paradoxical way, just now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked whole realm, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must all of a sudden see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but are still connected in the extreme with a closely defined piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a land that is free of land, water or oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short break.
The government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government,
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership ships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the existing guided tours, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deep and, in a sense, still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of inconvenience, a feeling of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, that the majority's salary is more and more foreign and superior.
The demand for Leadership, therefore, undermines a branched but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseeable "revolts" of the voters and in the unaverted reversal of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in terms of what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is being strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses."
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a glue and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached the target.
With a glue applied on a surface of only 2.5 square cm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material produced by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecko, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "easily removed from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," added Liming Dai.
For example, to go to the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the nanotubes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the space sector.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
The other art of research - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair, purifies itself from dust by moving on a surface and thus always keeps a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Caution for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and the amount of vitamin in the summer, may cause serious health damage when taken with certain vital medicines, as they may have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices in combination with drug intake. In the course of the 236 meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again made an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endangering the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthma, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
In a report two years ago, the same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix, and stressed that care should be taken to ensure what is drunk in combination with means such as diazepan or metadon.
It is NOT just grapefruit - according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances that are inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the various international producers who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is appropriate to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still any ambiguities, to ask a pharmacist or a doctor not to be afraid, "the expert of the Ansa Agency stresses.
The Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more important for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A forecast that did not receive little polemics as an answer and was given to the economist years later, but today proves to be quite right.
"I am surprised and also shocked at the rapid disappearance of the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom from the public perspective," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style that is particularly opposed to the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both in the public administration and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now sparsely designed initial menu, a basic compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics processing modules while maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a question is assigned to each processor in order to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are in the process of publishing various OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be published.
The Italian version is available on the following link to the download: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html.
The program is also available for the Linux operating system, except for Windows and Mac OS.
On request you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, the free movement of costs may be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, so it is also in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the great throw: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text setting program; Calc, the table program, which aims to repress Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more well-known access; and last but not least, draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target that can be slightly exceeded at already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Even coal tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new doping case mi framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-ranking and winner of the best climber's jersey.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who was tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epo. This was previously the case with the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are one of those carried out in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and according to the Associated Press also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the stage behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climber's jersey.
THEME REMOVATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES: Is ITALY RASSISSIAN?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only accepted with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racist people? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the issue of racism in Italy, which is based on the case of the young, Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guembre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a package of cookies.
The case shows what the Times call "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord are recorded."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times is based on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President of the State also stress: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism at a meeting at the Quirinal."
Students victims of high rental prices of up to 900-Euro per room
The market for apartments for students has no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. In fact, a large number of students lose their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level" - the people responsible for Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, lack of registration, without a rental price limit, unauthorized underrental.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices by a revision of the tax.
With a closer look at the study, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350 / 400 euros, one room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250 / 280 euros are for a sleeping area of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping area in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who evade the area can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centokelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for one room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bed is 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350 Euro.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they are more important in the urban economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the great urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multilanguage complex in the periphery, means in the long term death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom one has made a piece of road full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world that is probably forever lost.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have been closed; these mines paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main guilty are the multiplexkinos, because it is these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has been leading the lists, 81 are in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but the first thing is to maintain the already existing, because it closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplexcinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing budget for the trade union fund remains out of the question: the government's debt burden is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between EUR 16 and 18 million a year would be of need. "
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it by an agreement between the community and the Anec, is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support the traditional cinema, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to go to the traffic-sensitive areas of the centre and to park at more favourable parking charges.
"It is a welcome initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiple rooms, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Bagiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that made me start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges of the prosecution of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a sum of 10 million euros for involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Disrespecting any kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers say, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"The Mafia group was thus made possible - according to the judges - by official means to enter the city hall and to co-determine the policy of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to the links of local administrations and organised crime." There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest. "
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli, was beheaded.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and then also because of the alleged links between organised crime and the local administration - the local politicians of their municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle East coalition in May 2006.
He cried out to Skandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was referring to the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he claimed to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant this morning, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
A defamation action in the context of the Dal Torrione case has shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - which has made the public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan. "
When the energy comes out of the waves, the great ones suddenly run up
It is an unbeatable source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and only now it seems that the great energy companies in the world understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all now look at, and also seek to occupate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years, and these studies have not happened to be significantly intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gas, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would also come.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, it is now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that are relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies" - the spokesperson of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal - and is considering the possibility of working with us. "
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially given that in Alaska, oil is still being promoted by the US and President Bush has just launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are not known, but observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmental protection authorities.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and also Scotland have a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it is necessary to have a much greater impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of connected bojen for example.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the bojen up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers via flasks and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn runs a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval, and part of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using subsea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Recovery Research, a special interest deserves the potential that is in the tides at the moment.
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, the sun's radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states like New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
