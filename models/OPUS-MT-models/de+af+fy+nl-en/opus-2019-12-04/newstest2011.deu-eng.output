What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery."
The new leaders of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city's representation at all.
The newspaper "Mükálně.cz" has once "knocked out" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as it has dominated the notorious serpent that has been entrenched in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the faded era of the mayor Pavel Bém, is rejected by some of the most well-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it was found that the new councils are in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, to the term "golfloch."
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every once in a while."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Mütálně.cz this June before the ODS 'election conference, the editorial group picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously connected to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "largest Prague Golfloch," "go to the confectionery," "bullneck," "treason of the capital" and "faded."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the civil democrats talk to each other."
"It is important for me how we understand each other in the framework of our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký, in the above mentioned headline, would not have known that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek is speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says Kacky nothing and the only term he obtained correctly during the test was "the biggest Prague golfway."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And funny: "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then decipher not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Lord of the Environment Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and what it means to "go to the confectionery."
"I think that means going into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In accordance with Březina, however, he is obliged to have taken this knowledge out of the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar-born snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing in us."
"We call ourselves by the name, sometimes we also use short or nickname," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called Salopp "Hulda" by his party members.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I do not know if my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník actuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Grandpa" or less friendly to the "Old," the representative of Miroslav Poche, who, before the elections, drew attention to himself by making a party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" by some colleagues (well-known Czech Lego figure).
The names are the only one that the S & Ds allow in the internal language use.
Hulínský does not like it when it is called "Hulda," but Deník Mümálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname, "Doctor of the Gummikhappel Rights," is supposed to be about Petr Hulínský acquiring his title as Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more of the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared, as they help and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation that takes care of more than a hundred women in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, who have been expelled by their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, he published a brochure to stop the "witch persecution."
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But it is also the case in other African countries to be accused of witchcraft.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured it with Petroleum and just lit it.
The BBC server also reported about this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is flammable, which is used for ritual anointing.
And that is, after the group has tried to "expel" a "evil spirit" from the woman. "
The isolation of "witches" support people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fesserwomen of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian President himself has been very involved in this last year.
"After his aunt's death, President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt, because they were supposed to have a part in their death and now they would try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of Shamane from the near Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, illegally abducted women and men from Gambia villages and brought them to the President's farm in Canilai," said the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
At the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an abscess from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure were the almost thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is now in prison.
All three have just increased the rent as part of the so-called "deregulation."
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rental, the son is to cover next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not even flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he points out with his finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signature he has a power of authority.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half-wrong and half-signed.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just turns away.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava thus becomes the major "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year's, this deregulation is ahead of most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, the tenants of which have not yet paid a market rent.
Therefore, Maktálně.cz decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
The bodyguards of a security agency are right next to the door and there is a call device.
"Rent 2011," a special key field on the touch screen lights up.
In short, and the device already spits out a number plate.
We have hardly decipher the number "157" and already beep it on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to be the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts will be flapping the majority of the tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes an increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rental in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it is only the beginning," the ladies answer behind the switch after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, who came from Ostrava, had taken this issue quite loudly, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a toilet glasses they could change," the man mentioned in the beginning gets air.
So far, the employees are mainly on the switch to convince themselves whether they really get the promised rent discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who will sign the new lease until 15 December, will also benefit from a half-reduced February rental.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with questions.
"Of the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of this," the switch officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall tables where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its website.
"No one's going to court here," one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least in part, gives her the right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which I have 5,000 for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," he says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of the rent is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byty housing portfolio of the company, and - in the opinion of the house owners, the neglect of the housing fund, which was criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-shining information always appears.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square meter per month," is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," argues RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not drive the rent to the height, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company is imposing another obligation: all the revenue from the increase in rent (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heat insulation.
But - priority should be given to those who sign the agreements on the increase.
The architects saw in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Designn.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with all that it includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The project and architecture office Arch.Design, from which a whole series of well-known Brno buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In a wise way, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby tree age and the company is due to the fact that the project students return to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working short, the kindergarten is another bonus that Art.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of its social program.
The construction engineers have so much easier to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to gain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The minimum farm is financed by the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy.
This funding (grants of CZK 2, 8 million) has enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be acquired and for a period of 2 years qualified staff and operations are provided.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but the day is different over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, they are also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is not taken away when the children are late to pick up from a far away kindergarten.
The parents are therefore more productive in their working time.
No wonder there are also natural and loyal relations between employers and workers.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programmes strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interior of Gaudi
The roof mutates like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are reared fish mowers.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house was given the nickname "Bone House" with its organic forms.
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splits and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of the scales and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only with a more accurate look that you can see that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-through order.
During the night the whole facade is even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting still strengthens the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and faded forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy-shaped wood copies the window frames, railing, decorative elements of doors, even watch holes and bars.
The house of Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the conversion of a house from 1877, which was carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed to the idea of Gaudí's unusual and even cheaper conversion.
The rental house Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its zipper that the decorations were created for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, many other artists and artists were also involved in the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
For example, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the name "Bone House" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "glowing house."
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia, is shown at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, which was unique for the time being, with ventilation channels and typical cams.
A little bizarre is already adjusting her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and was not able to be accompanied by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the completion that they asked for remedy.
Among other things, the Council's leaders also met with the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there was no change, on the contrary - only 15 days after the call of the city district in this respect, Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was given to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could easily chat without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential discussions.
The house was also given a rather unusual roof and two other floors by the construction of Gaudí's new façade.
Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is covered and the lighthouses, is also impressive.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150.birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly acceptable business, it was kept to the visits, and it was also extended to other common and the roof-floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the building is not, however, a parrot, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the house residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most beautiful bed frame, but the quality of the deck - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be harmonised in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust are to be submerged is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than common polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a solid plate, then moisture will dust: it is not excluded that the mould is formed under it.
In the election, of course, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Probably all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"They simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer) for their severed shoulders, heels and hips."
"I recommend these, among other things, to those who are diabetic, who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the" information "from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it is right on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you don't roll around like a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The fish-cooling foam also provides protection against deubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women, who are 180 cm tall, need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm of sun beds, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should be enough room for the easily applied arms," says Ing. Helena Prokofová, the sister master of the upholstery and space designer, who has been devoted for years to the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also presents this subject in specialized schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also the same high.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the rust in different heights and this is not possible in every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the shape layer and the fine padding.
"You must not feel the feathers by hand or by sitting down," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
All-padded beds with a mattress and a support such as a combined siamzwillinge have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be air-conditioned and the cover cannot be washed, which is already the case today.
And since one night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and blocked sieve).
This is why professionals also reject advertising slogans who promise a life of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long guarantees.
Every thing has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: In the case of mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, deductible covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress saver, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (extremely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often changes like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed record in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-adjustable lattice rust with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamels), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (if applicable, also combinations of latex and coconut), rust always pay off with a larger number of latte, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with a loin support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeleton are included on adjustable lamellar rust, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring legs, special flexible shoulder modules are also provided.
This is about a special fixing of the spring bars, which allows to push the spring bars or even to bend them in such a way that they allow the punctual down of the shoulder of the sleeper.
It's an important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattresses manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses."
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - when you use a bad (too large and full) pillow to the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
This makes a 50 x 60 cm pillow ideal, such as the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head cushion (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (hay-filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
In the case of mattresses, the new word "organic."
Instead of oil raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means in the case of mattresses, which consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also use microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when you sleep.
Here too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cool" plant extract from birch leaves to allow the mattress cover to absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warm" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the circulation of blood, so the weaker sex becomes warm during sleep.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams creates more-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to cover.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not that easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with a fixed Visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material temple that introduced the era of the fish-cooling foam with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur is soft in heat, it is solidified in a cool environment.
This way it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases the sleep comfort.
However, fish-coolant foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local producers use the foam substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of one's own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system originally invented for the search for cars is as good a place for people, which would also be helpful in such cases as it was recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but it should soon be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and terror, so they look for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it will come to the tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the suppliers of GPS positioning devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that on a case-by-case basis, it can be an abuse of such equipment, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had a case like this so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that a child, if it may not wear such a thing, will simply get rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At the beginning, the mobile phones had a great deal of expectations for the parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the event of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance equipment were to be used more widely, they would also look for it, as their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the police criminals are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the RC Monitoring company, Roberta Čech, which offers positioning services for both cars and persons, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only a special software is needed.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that these are either devices in match box size that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There's always a risk of losing it.
Mr Pilin of the Macro Because, therefore, in the present one tests devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or positioning device.
"Or he'll only notice after a while what the police are giving a head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of positioning function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many figurines that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic you can hold but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 km of ignition lines, been fired with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 km of ignition cord to the army.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the company STV Group, for example, for lupian 40 million crowns.
In his statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition line, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume each year to the 60 km ignition line.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which was addressed by MF DNES, this indication shows that the entire army must have a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 km of ignition belts.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that, for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of ignition line is sufficient, then the army has created a soothing stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand-held weapons, so that the lack of means was severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I can't think of why they buy from us such a huge amount of ciphers."
But that is their decision, they will know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, to which we as a dealer wish to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, has established the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition line, so that the army would have covered itself with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible," one of them admits, but he wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for free, but cost further money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition line.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," Speaker Pejšek informed us of the position of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
For the comparison only: the annual consumption of fire-belts by police pyrotechnics, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has for a few years not exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can use before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, it is also possible to keep the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and therefore also reliable ignition barriers open.
In any case, the Ministry of Defence has a huge problem in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-and-a-half-armed Czechoslovak people's army prepared for their march to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, which was addressed by MF DNES, the Czech forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition lines that they have bought today so "cheap."
To this day I find the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The winning placement in the "Small Business of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel's franchise.
The winner of the last year of the "Small Business of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that in Liberec there is no good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he got a building with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time was a bit of a nuisance to me, and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of business in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already signed up," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large part of this sale of the licence for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition" Entrepreneur of the Year, "Mr Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater acquaintance, indeed popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, every sight is good.
He says that to this day he is taking advantage of the contacts and acquaintances that would not have come to it at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relations."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also reflects a little on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really do not see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is only a little in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successors a calmer year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the Vodafone company of the year in the last year was awarded to Karel Žárský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to get a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this assessment encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and increased our self-confidence in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered to his father Karel árský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate to leave his career in the company where he was busy until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the above-mentioned competition and its medialization that it also became aware of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now see the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country in terms of value," says Karel Žárský.
The last year, however, was not only a sign of victory in Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which at that time even less shook the citizens, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We could not, of course, avoid this situation."
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even take on redundancies," explains Karel Žárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to control the situation and keep the company in black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to cut down on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and obtained main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a great deal of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žárský has been told.
An opinion poll that cleans up with insensitive rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the business competition.
Some of the silly rules have already been able to get out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion survey "Absurity of the Year" the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
For example, more than one third of not all four thousand vote-makers decided.
For example, the social security administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have called it by two clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require any extracts from the trade register from the controls of social security payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "absurdity of the year" is to look at all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and to lift the insinuating ones.
This year, this is already part of a fourth competition for entrepreneurs, which is organised by the German business newspaper (HN) and is a popular public event.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that are only used to obstruct business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of the terms of the business, and eight places worse than the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in the year and is based on the same scenario each year.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
To register, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the competition organiser will select seven candidates for the "anti-price" and let the public vote on the web site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most voices get.
This year's opinion poll has already been notified of more than a hundred, more specifically 105 meaningless regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles must pay for motorways and highways, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must meet every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November at Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a meeting in which people of political and public life regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
"There can be no real economic upswing where the state is throwing the entrepreneurs in the legs, so it is my aim to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for the entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unsensual orders from the world have an effect.
In 2007, people were most concerned with the obligation imposed on the entrepreneurs to report to the business office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or to a church with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by a revision of the Trade Act.
The obligation, which was given the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office on missions of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card."
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the Regulation, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two body scales in the speaking room, was chosen.
This regulation has been somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the requirement to refrigerate has been removed.
A new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the impact of your business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition is "rebel of the year."
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company of the year, companies signed up for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and bowing enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they are diametrically different in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the development of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-related workers, which account for 70% of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the Vodafone company of the year, it took the third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, among other things, a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportional wage reduction.
The jury also paid tribute to the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is located in the health of its employees, and therefore it has acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, and it also promotes home work in their employees and in company actions it uses cartering services provided by a home-protected workshop.
"We also support the Foundation" People in need, "which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
The activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlbader region is also worth mentioning, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, skills and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the category of responsible company of the year, all the district finalists of the Vodafon competition of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition" responsible company of the year, "but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrest of the police in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been holding arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken from the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition that was just taking place in order to resolve the claims for the refund in such a way that the land offered in the competition was in the hands of a specific interested party.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are following a person in a public competition because of the delicacy of fraudulent activities," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo," could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the sparse official information.
The speaker of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to the question of Právo in this regard, that the police had actually held arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "the request to offer claims for the transfer of land under the Land Law 'and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the land offered.
"These persons shall, in the context of the request, offer a higher value of their claims for the refund to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land used."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information about who had applied for the request and since he was himself a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of claims for the refund, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Land Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Land Fund, which was prosecuted for the fact that he was issuing land in replacement refunds, which had already been decided on the site of construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. acquired land from the Land Fund, which was intended for the construction of public roads, at the point where the construction of the access magistrate to the Borské pole business area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very conveniently with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time the town hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
As of January, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all energy types, but also higher water and waste water charges, and for district heating and some places the rent will also grow.
As of January, families will have to take several hundred crowns out of the wallet a month more than they have so far.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas will be 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places you will also have to pay for district heating supplies.
The current cost of the household is a few hundred more per year.
High electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so the debt is the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, including photovoltaic systems.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns are expected to be more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places are planning to increase prices.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 kroner a month from January, more than 1000 kroner more per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague in turn threaten 9 percent higher water and waste water charges, in case the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is, however, still one of the lowest in comparison to the whole Czech Republic.
In the North Bohemian, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges should rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, huge rent price increases are expected in 140,000 rentals, where the so-called rental regulation will be removed from January.
For example, the CPI Byty housing company, which owns 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this increase in the rent, the company wants to interest him in the court.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Ferret and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Ferret, Rum and Vodka, for example, also a good whisky that was stolen from the home bar from the father.
These are the drinks where drunk Czech teenagers under 15 need to be treated most in need.
No exception are children who have to sleep out their hangover in the hospital.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the inclusion of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief of the children's department in the central Bohemian clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father is able to get a bottle from the home bar, and if not, then at least it's far-away or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief of the arts.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most important thing is that it's about the distance or the rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," said Mrs Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers in hospital are far from being an exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulance delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first brought into the blood with 3.5 percent alcohol and in combination with" Extase, "the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about it was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor is surprised.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in the use of their own sprouts is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic, "explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Mrs Jurinová, the speaker of the Motol Hospital was sent to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine by the mid-November.
However, only cases with severe alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink such a bottle of liquor in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes to which one hundred percent of the children are entitled: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of sorrow for the bad testimony or because of joy for the holiday."
"On the night of the Walpurgis, I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache in the morning after that, which comes from the dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-lowering infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" wonderful "experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anything."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who sometimes spoils the patient's mood by adding to them the costs that it will cost them the treatment.
For the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this as a means of education once in a while, when I had the children at the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to make the money for a single such feat," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his view, however, the health insurance funds do not take the form of regression procedures to charge the parents for the costs necessary for the healing of drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 from a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
They have been seen abroad only in the case of maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the two-seat version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are still conserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she physically exposes the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The one-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term aircraft, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-sided L-159T1 was replaced in the present state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat combat aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four redundant L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to enforce the aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that it is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer, in what way he realizes the thing," led Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, and the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a legal follow-up.
The European Commission has referred the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, for the reason that it should have selected the aircraft by means of a call for tender and that it should not have been the case that a single manufacturer would have called.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one is to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose forefinger is longer than the ring finger are apparently at lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should be subjected to a prostate cancer test, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand pointer was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was applied, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose forefinger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33%, and in men up to 60, even by 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is the testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech gentician and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known to him as fleeting, but he still does not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "fully proven."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow deck on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walking trails lies mostly fixed snow, the winter service workers were often on the ground all night.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed because of some accidents of Lkws and PKws and also the D1 at Brno is "in the direction of Prague."
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Dispatch of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At 91 km, a truck crashed, at 93 km, two trucks collapsed, and there were injuries in this accident.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have collapsed.
The drivers should go right behind Brno at 190 km or over Brno and at 182 km at Kývalka.
There are, for example, kilometer-long congestion.
An accident also happened on the D11, which was immediately on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeters thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the Prosek district, and the Štěrboholská street is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlplatz and Peaceplatz.
At 8: 00 in the morning, the Prague crisis team will meet.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
It is essential that the passengers know the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyně is closed from Wednesday 11: 00 to 5: 00 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
In the vicinity of Brno, there are a number of snow raids in the area of Vyškov, and in the area of Blansko one is forced to use snow grass on some of the higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling for snow cleaning.
When they can be moved again, it is not possible to estimate so far.
In the region of Hodonín, caution is required in the field of white carpathians.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons can only be scattered with inert means of scattering, there is a snow ceiling of up to five centimeters thick, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, most of them in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
But in the Czech Republic it stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is known only to date under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the power ratio to their favour.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this gun and contain highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
This means that you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trenches.
It is not usually protected from the top, so the murderous steel splinter rain from the top can easily put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically doing this: he is targeting the target and sending out a laser beam that determines the distance, he wins a precise vision point after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he just needs to press it.
"Let's say they've measured 543 m."
"If you press the gun, the gun will charge itself and shoot the gun at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their work from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance reported on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which have so far been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the working conditions of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had also been a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport was of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezerent Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" was won again.
That was a "great site acquaintance."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management about the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given the rash.
Now it is about preventing a long emptiness in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at Rathauplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, bought the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Kannen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu-Konuzern, based in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped plan - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat.
Amazon is blocking servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to be in England.
The Wikileaks unveiling platform is under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileak's founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol list, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the unveiling activists reported by short-term news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depresches to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say to the step: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after working with Senator Joe Lieberman for research, the television channel CNN reported to the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to prevent the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and ruthless approach puts our national security at risk and threatens around the globe," it is said in a communication of the paraplegic senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of interpol's arrests.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There was even a call for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange is right to fear his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, a head of government advisor Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on TV that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of strokes.
The spokesman of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we're taking care of a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
As a special representative, the Vice-Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, Russell Travers, was informed of the White House.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had become necessary following the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The American government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active, should they be in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that is necessary."
The ice university
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice conditioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German somewhat old-fashioned the ice-cream, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling counter with a spatula, then puts it in the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't get past the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university set up the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003 so that the ice-cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses for chocolate ice cream and internships in the home ice cream hall.
Some in the Midlife crisis dream of a new career, others just dare to get on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and, after years, wants to do something of its own in a nerve-stimulating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream hall in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the silky flatness and the good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget, however, the little tree of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all the milk ice cream.
The teacher is immediately stormed with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation go free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, for example, the guar-core flour from the guarbean.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sacks in itself, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations at the base mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on you dozens of aromatised additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Or the fruit sorbs with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just in the ice cream from the white basic mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice-cream machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also the subject of the varieties of fruit ice.
More flavors, more fruit puree - it is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more crispy when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture of the gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream an addition of sugar is necessary.
Luciano draws out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make accounting easier.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is smashed creatively at the same time and cooled to minute temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small flaws are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo is covered with fruit puree from top to bottom, when the over-dimensional bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until that happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, has been subdued by the gene-plant-experimenting industry.
This is now being proposed by the Test Biotech expert group, which understands itself as an independent Institute for the Impact Assessment of Biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a major contributor to the Efsa test rules for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa rules are in the same way as the Ilisi's position papers, and are thus the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech had a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had changed the sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed human links between the EU's controlling authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Office, as well as EU parliamentarians, light-headed.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
They are based on all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, they are referred to in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to expose it.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any animal feeding test and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what for example does genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you are not looking for the risks, how are you going to find them?," asks Then indicting.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
The scientist has been research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also worried about some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday night he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the Tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators had moved on and had started to abort a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of people demonstrated against S21, the million-heavy depth of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6,000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the brooks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarette jellyfish.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the brooks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former French army ammo depot, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the people who were in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground to gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden shop that was once a guard's house.
In September, when he was told in the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition operator, he was smashed and threatened.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilo-heavy quaders, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons of Rongen had bought, 25 large truck charges.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest is already sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house owners.
They would have come from all over the world and dragged away what the trunk and the trailer could wear.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long since turned into "müerle" or into limitations of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets in his car, takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and stopped, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He's storing 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he's carving his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's jamming.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, it's swarm.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
Go on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
The quaders once belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertin from the Stuttgart police presidium, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand earlier and moved with simple flask and ox carts, he becomes very fearful.
"It would be a scandal if you yelled at something like that."
He's not rich, he's not rich.
But 14 people are employed today by the stone dealer, and they have also settled in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residue owner.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
Talent fight for high potential
There's a lot of pressure at the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to get to know Volkswagen together with VW developers about the car of the future.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the close-up fight and, like VW, are relying on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms before they come to the labour market and are advertised by others.
And because the universities do not issue any statements on the performance of their students, one tries to see and to bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes pen, rubber bays and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
It was new that so offensive about the students was being bullied.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the newly graduated will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
They must, however, rise and, in particular, have a high-skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers were left unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
It organizes elaborate recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carving hunt, where the participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to join, you can choose in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies to the United States.
In the case of housing and stabbing around the high potential at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sail was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be the result of the bill.
"We still have contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booming on the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the Pirsch in a classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Bübe knows about the young problem.
At the moment, 35 jobs are written out on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to occupy holiday positions."
"This takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that we can do internships or write his thesis."
Proud advertising is not recommended for the solar specialist.
For this purpose the company tries to promote with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"This is often not possible for a large group," says staff manager Bübe.
Money doesn't play the main role in job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, child care or good access opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld took the 55th place in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute will draw up an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Steube hopes that the placement will also provide additional points for the job-seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, the internal employer branding is called, that is, employer brand formation within its own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would be advertising for their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a ban on this, and so has finally withdrawn its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by the Minister for the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The impact of the strict ban, which is to be applied for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost 11 workers life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf have not been finally resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, had lifted the post-explosion drill stop.
After that, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent safety rules, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been in breach of numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative control holes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by means of more stringent regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also denies the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
OgonIsland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil that has been spent has destroyed nature in the Nigerian ogonland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Do not turn away," the ecoactivist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following the attempt to light up a boy in the water, who is watered to the chest, with the fences surrounding him: in the rainbow-coloured water glare the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not possible to see that brown oil swabs are floating under the surface.
She used to collect shrimps here, tells Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty river.
In the meantime, the weary flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a born pipeline poured a huge amount of crude oil into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishing waters: the OgonIsland, located in the heart of the Nigerian delta, is one of the world's worst populated regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps through rivers, the whole extent of the healing becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motor boat is stirring up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees are hanging like black lakritzstangen from the ground, sad to let the palm trees that are found in a single place hang their wedges.
Birds' swarms, as are usual in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the external border is silent, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, will spread into a spenistic peace.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari, "we are in constant danger of health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fighting for decades: the first explorers from Europe were here more than 60 years ago, in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: while the entire Deltaregion of the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines are being pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the OgonIsland are broken, too unstable the group is able.
All a few hundred meters of steel stand like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" the heads of the holes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant current of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have, according to expert estimates, been in the delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that they had entered the sea in the "Exxon Valdez" of the "Supertanker" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drills and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria has much lower safety standards than usual in the world, and the US scientist Richard Steiner presented it to the group in 2008: the rate of failure on the lines alone is "by many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, the mangrove shapes show up: they are splinter naked and oiled to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected to tubes, some of which are randomly scattered on the site, a fire flicks: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the reception head, later, at the end of the line of kerosene, and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The oil price of almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be undercut by the illegal cookers: they get their raw material for free.
It is from "bunkers," which tap the pipeline network across OgonIsland: this way, according to experts, the country is lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Nigerian delta.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is unlawfully processed: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, are filled in and shipped to the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is due to the depopulation or to the lax mode of production, considers the activist Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell, in particular, was so destroyed that only a deduction of the group would be considered: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese would be better off."
Michael's getting nervous.
"High time you're leaving," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil diggers are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerian, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction workers in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered in the investigation of an emergency aircraft a possible construction vehicle that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have been much more lucky than they have known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines in its investigation - and now warns against a possible construction vehicle.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was mentioned in an opinion published by the ATSB Authority on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."

Under it is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allowed him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would require compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the time of the engine's fire, parts had dissolved and the flanges had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce turned an oil fire into a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa switched off the engine at an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: During the night snow fell almost all over the country.
There is chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
In car accidents, at least three people were killed.
The winter is freezing in Germany: at icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic has snow to Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and the east are partly 15 cm thick snow ceilings.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is very limited.
At the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in permanent use, but did not finish with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavy trees swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) is expected to be on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level.
In Saxony, the snow traffic on the motorways and federal roads caused significant problems.
According to the weather-central meteomedia, that is why in Saxon Switzerland, an alarm level was called violet - the highest level at all.
In some cases there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds made for relocations.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to the German Railway, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overthrown trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and directions are the main problems.
In Saxony, the distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringia Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue workers with wool ceilings, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a speaker, a number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service was in permanent use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, they still had almost 400 field beds available.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here again a truck was caught on a train crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver was killed.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had taken her car to Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore be stirring up in light soils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin storms
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
Just now, Deutsche Bank has made its group seat pretty: the twin storms in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; the bankers have now been allowed back to their old job.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes with a call to a spokesperson.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then to rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will return its registered office after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and then thoroughly renovated it.
The energy conversion took up the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the "Greentowers" towers to be renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, the speaker said, is still open.
Thousands of mourning for dead friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered, because the safety situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth had a severe explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were spilled underground.
A probe had been dropped into the crash shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could go down for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now, relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island in the light of the sun.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were set, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates were shown.
Also pictures and personal objects, including clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags wept to half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come to the surface again, New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrence Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, it started to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Is Splitter a part of the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn relists old genre boundaries with his "Walhalla Rising" fighting epoch.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his peers and with almost superhuman forces, he transforms his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators in the search for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use a violent method of killing and his enemies are already taking the intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and the other figures can be drawn to one or two sentences or a few painful cries of death.
Otherwise it is kept silent and swollen in the scary beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the scenery.
Ideal for adult cineastes with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera aurts.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, it's only a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," but he is stoically refusing to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art kino friends are expected to be deterred from the spying brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when one-eye, for free-of-interpretation reasons, with a group of violent Christian missionaries, breaks into Jerusalem by ship and is stuck in a flute and fog for an eternity before the team appears to arrive in America and continues to remain silent.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a movie rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a shame, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bluttrifying facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a strong action, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fiberdream.
And there is no escape from it for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and, with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, slowly seizes his throat, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is faithful to one's eyes, is keeping something like innocence, and all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who at some point becomes a warrior of hell for enemies and temporary allies, may become an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means perdition, but perhaps only for those who are already perished.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, to upset and to wonder.
It's an experience.
Enigmatic work of the earth
The IAEA nuclear power authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is opposed to giving its opinion on this - it still allows for controls.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria is supposed to have built in the Quader with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the electricity.
According to a briefing from the CIA from the end of April 2008, the nuclear reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly appropriate.
The CIA introduced a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
By computer animation it revealed where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building from the area or even the interior.
The reactor was said to have been just before the start-up, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than then, yes, the puzzles became more important over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but did not see any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some secret service providers in Europe prefer to be even more careful and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible."
You're missing hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
When asked how safe he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only answered lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
Although the Syrians quickly removed the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former head inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which is likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always committed never to operating a secret nuclear programme or to building a reactor.
The uranium was from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as the satellite images.
It also prevents the inspectors from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in charge of the attack, confirmed the official position.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessfully carried out since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility for the Authority," as a high Western diplomat admits at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon treaty in the area that the IAEA is watching over.
As a key to progress in the field of information, the IAEA appears to see three other facilities "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and different from this one still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what equipment they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the South German newspaper, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally at the IAEA, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and on satellite images found a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - with this very reason Syria is refusing access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is being prepped by the US to delay military installations.
The nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader at the Euphrates material has been transported to and from it.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
There are, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities," that is, uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it later, there are, at best, plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether any debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads have disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has been.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which has examined Syria for its suitability as a warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered to be unlikely to the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently associated them with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria was doing the earth's work in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent a number of months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also made this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had complained a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, therefore the matter has no high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting in place so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means that the Vienna Atomic Energy Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from seeking an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless director's debut in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is constantly falling in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been turned off in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female victims of war wrote about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR to Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself an ambassador to the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not a diplomatist - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read its script, has given a spin permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author himself has committed not to pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with great effort in the Yugoslavia conflict to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film in the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew themselves in it before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What, after all, sounds a lot different than the "rape sacrifice" variant, is getting used to being a torture worker.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now you can only give peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally into the network.
Let's get out of here.
This evening, it's going to be really good for the Irish.
No sign of fraud.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans were jogging with joy with a strong loud music, they were stamping with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the South Irish Cork is shaking because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro winning premium plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this yummy drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy himself in the process of distracting himself from the exciting question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will have an application in New Zealand in January.
"I have a generous feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have a job there yet."
After all, his friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a lot of work to do as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
It is likely that 100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, and experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute will predict in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are maintained, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying about the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has so far only been a mountain.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are all kinds of letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything in Ireland goes down the stream."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Jura-student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future coming up, because the government is only in the field of eyebrows and no longer offers the young people any future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She's watching her commitons hang out from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years' time.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to make a positive effort to occupy the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade fair that offers a round-up service on working abroad.
"For professional start-ups, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but it also brings freedom and fun.
What it feels like to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan's home is rarely seen, because he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, when he first stepped over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am almost never more."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained gardens, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pour in hot tea and say, "I have no children that I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer does not like the weathering that he often hears at the moment.
"No one must starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in the past on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that thought.
Leave the future open and just see how it's going with life somewhere else.
He's had a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is still one thing that is very worrying about him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might be a good-bye party.
"Don't make too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-away party, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatrical Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results were followed by the Latinobarómetro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly in the eye of this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% a year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse in the last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America were only experiencing a short period of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America reports this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and have thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents over-regional indicated that the private sector is essential for development, and in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-hand president, Hugo Chávez, has a large number of private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with this role being taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A sleep of choice
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts were far from the fears of the electors who hastened to help the besieged country.
Overfilled electoral urns, multiple votes, ballot notes in the rock, destroyed electoral locals and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Wahllocale opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitian people, many of whom had become homeless because of the earthquake in January, were looking for an option.
After all, some of them gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, called for the election results to be lifted due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests all over the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many matters."
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposed to be committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected hit is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martinly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity action.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no agreement with the voters, from the election hearing to the winner of the election, could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, a small turnout was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitian people were prevented by the lack of organisation of the vote.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Heavily in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you re-election next year depends on whether the clearly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's election, directed economic policy, often set up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president and the couple to spend the extra revenue on their own.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disagreements.
Some of the regime critics from the ranks of the ruling perists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on its own.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates and wage demands of the trade unions are almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as its main objectives, rather than the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then made official inflation statistics beautiful.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undercut the growth surge by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to rejoin Argentina financially in the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt redebt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club donors, to whom it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it will need the support of the middle class, which is largely enough of the Church's.
When the Argentinean return from their summer leave in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be exiled.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether to keep many political decisions of her husband quiet and quiet.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the voters, were elected to the five districts of the city, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the development of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only a little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it was not given a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city council together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with tie-makers, flag-swinging mass removals and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man of the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a standing audience was killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and has put the DPP in a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is worth noting that the relations with the mainland have not been addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their real independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided too much of the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For its part, the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of China's policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was vehemently in favour of absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working and youth.
As President of the DPP, Tsai was very much in favour of Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatism Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a reapproach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category newcomer of the year
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category of newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the album was released to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her tidy voice and a good sense for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, you can easily compare Spalding to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 is the closest to being a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination of Spalding.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This was a huge success.
The competitors of Iyers include "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophone James Moody and "Positoously" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a ruby favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where there are other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well-deserved in the category of large group. He is therefore against the Billy Kids Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead to the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hats "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No 4 was first performed and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic, led by Esa-Pekka Salons, in Disney Hall on 4 January.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a phone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for the recording of the works of Stravinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category "Classic Crossover," the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics rejected the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to the Commission's statement of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local provisions and will become an aesthetic focus.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice is the rule."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," a comment was made.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmoud to non-violence.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wished for a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filters.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque should have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approx. 17.500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered necessary to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published on Thursday in the online edition of the Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital to life, are not necessarily defined," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different from phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost blends everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ-1 bacterium to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe is growing better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based life form can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a microbiology teacher at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has been no working example.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van steel, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still under way."
"We do not want to say any more," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district morgue in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship, because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The big-ass Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's wage. Microchips were implanted to the animals for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion roars again after legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy, the "prepare" slider plan, on the off-target, took off the $5 billion debt and paved the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and TV shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the head of the company.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million loan to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is running the company.
The restructuring of the studio started in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company management, who fought with interest payments of $300 million a year to solve their financial problems.
In August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and a restructuring expert, who became known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 gamblers of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction only attracted a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything started from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to come to the movies at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films according to "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump parts or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And even though fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of these are Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer.
More and more button cell-operated toys are on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs who sing a note when you press their belly.
Once you press a note, you can play a song by pressing it several times.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of healthy and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the Animatronic doll offers interplay like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge with wheel blocking it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car drive can become a lesson, with a better knowledge with an autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, lighter screen after Lepfrog's first major revision of the Lepster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
They can be roller shoes or a puffle-fabric animal.
The latest headcell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of clots through a maze.
And he can handle a lot.
Our one fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subordinates, and gave orders with military authority and silent voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their slope to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely from the age of a teenager, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood in a tight position.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"They look on average to me," Mr Tang notes.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-star: in 2009, 50 officials were reported to be circling a non-properly constructed snack car and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strip. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They should give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
You're right, so are the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat an audience to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as she put down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
An anti-violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper "China Daily" last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning."
The current approach is clearly inadequate for skeptics.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only be used as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job report, women aged 18 to 22 were wanted with a good figure and "harmonious facial traits."
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physical.
"The most important thing is her image," an unnamed district official at the quasi-government website Rednet.com indicated.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District's City Administration, does not wish to agree to this description,
However, it admitted that in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial suits.
Whether this is to be equal to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disappointments do not need to apply.
"We cannot, unfortunately, use a lameness or a bellyman here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bays and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so great a value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude as they have more ambitious career plans than simply to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the stripe deals with about 12 street dealers who try to sell on foot or on a bike as many rolls and magic dishes as possible before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his pasta kitchen on a bicycle car for a while.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It is the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in the free time.
"All the routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, were on the verge of cursing the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square where the female officials patched this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner yelled at Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a grim face built their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, was left behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr Li.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that, after his affair with a former voter and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity against him, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that led to headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a discipline sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been terminated and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has failed to respect the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during an election campaign in Ensign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after the hire of Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to take on any lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was contrary to the so-called ban on turning-door lobbying.
According to the published indications, "it seems to be an agreement and the violation of the turning door statutes," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are in the government's direction.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethiopian lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very careful to take political charges for a variety of defeats that the media have been following with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the president of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day when he was told that the Ministry would not raise any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much to say: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate case by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had infringed the Federal Electoral Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "knocking" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
When, for the first time in the last year, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the order of the Republicans.
After not noticing many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, said that the ethics commission was very soon following the example of the Ministry of Justice and that he was setting up his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
A half a dozen of them typed away in the courtroom.
In the minute, they sent their reports on cruel testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the rape process and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence that the jury has declared falls.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, which state the reasons for an appeal and which will be the subject of the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread and immediate penetration of insurmountable details, so that the jury has been affected in an unacceptable way by public indignation.
This objection could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe it is a real danger that the entry of new technologies into the courtroom will affect the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender.
The chairman, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, rejected the applications by decision last week in a short and concise manner when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, legal claims have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the new media there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom."
Some people believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims, which Mr. Hayes's conviction looked at half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes that are being pursued by a general public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes's lawyers are presenting to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the selection of judges.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a juror that was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he would have put undue pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a trial that they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"Such a daily urge of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced in New Haven before and perhaps even in the country."
Your focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more obnoxious than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly was a technical-hostile look that impoverished the reporting of future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the decision of the 1966 Supreme Court, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of words and negativity this week, little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party coalition or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not bring any breakthrough to the major issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions are no longer taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan score.
The public meeting of the President's Disability Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that hides the ideological gap that continues to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other calls for the willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters for a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the Washington November election was a mild vote at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise party passions that die again.
And that's good. "
On a number of issues, especially those on the agenda of the "big-duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefit is expected, even though only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the 510 Duck session "must not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 121st Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consistency is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012, as an advance, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, who were responsible for their formation.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high in poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put the health reform out of effect.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the Commission's recommendations on the deficit, which include a tax reform and an increase in some taxes, the increase in the retirement age and the reduction in public expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have so much insisted on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the party's current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must be careful of the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Party and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure example of a much more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that is being carried on the show this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that the two remain separate.
Sickled US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high-level protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders are moving up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime it would have been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as the Ambassador's report has said, individual people are called, and it is unheard of by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it" disturbed "and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a Kleptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which extends through the police, state security (FSB), the MVD and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level follow."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city offers no help."
The report further says that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, that is to say, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as important as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the money collection is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with cases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Mach, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
nationwide, so estimated by, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks in place 154 of a more recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause maladministration within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furious to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a low-lighted, stressed classroom with dirty and fading walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN and Cambodia Community Tribunal for the first time sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It cleans up families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, restlessness.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew up the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-supported peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh's prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their guardians no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the murdering poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officers of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rmmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring to justice Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on im Chaem, 64 years, which had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told the representative of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, the Chaem came back from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, In the Chaem refused to discuss its past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to invite her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be a war here."
In addition, Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first government-approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the judgment," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown by bushes and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pots body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a phone salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here are going to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take off a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to not collect any more weapons of uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's global nuclear security campaign, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be possible to collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had for years tried to convince Belarus not to collect high-enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been made to remove 187 pounds of weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all the precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapon-capable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... We won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train that over 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second start was decided on Monday and, according to the officers, was carried out by plane.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferated Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-like uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents that Wikileaks endured and forwarded to the daily "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, which charged the aid with defamation of human rights practices in a Dussian country, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," in order not to be "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "did not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government had little influence as it was in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the State Attorney Vicente González, for his part, gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for a declaration of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the Ambassador said after a discussion with the Prosecutor.
However, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the classified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to deal with discrete issues between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the US Ambassador and the Spanish Minister for the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely concerned with their independence and what they considered appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to make the tension faint."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violation, will be able to tolerate or intentionally ignore capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he stresses.
The child-killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "Mühsal" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this name, which she runs from a small point of view, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructed on the basis of testimony from its family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex-husband never let him do a DNA analysis.
She started a different relationship shortly after.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he thought it was good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and to leave what he wants."
She later mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or to send me an address to send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about the return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I do not want to lose it."
She says she'll take her first-born if she's all right.
"He will be with the one he needs to be with, that is, me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention when you consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another email.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other, not."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place he likes a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will take a summer course, so I have less spending on the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he'll find me, such a shit."
On the 30th: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison slayer."
"Terror a la galemeng (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting officer, explains to have a conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Center of Prisoners in Menorca to the Province Prison of Palma.
The legal defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the end of the matter, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and votes in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this ascending trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 members of the Congress during the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (of 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - currently has three - while ICV could hold its member or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the balance to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona's city council, one of the city's largest government departments: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot reach a majority or use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in the proportion of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's change. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
And Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also experienced a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 local authorities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani police arrested by the Barcelona Police Department and the Nigerian were the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombay attacks that required 106 deaths in 2008 - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaidas' counterfeit equipment worldwide and "thus their ability to act '.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda was composed, so that their "fighters" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries without any penalty.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe, and that is why, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have been involved in the research, and it is not to be ruled out that in the EU's area, similar attacks will occur in the next few days to those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhamad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt, and the Thai Sirikanaya Kijburung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
It is underlined in the course of the investigation that so far no links have been established between the arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay assassination, although the author of this attack, "Lashkar e-Taiba," was one of the recipient groups of the passports that were stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia a few days before the attack, through a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command," which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a large-scale documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas in person to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generality, which is not different from those already set up during the election campaign and can be combined with the primacy of the economic recovery and the absence of regional independence adventurers, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the top of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party has certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave it the 18 Members she had won last Sunday - a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to the vote to hold the vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party president of the PPC is concerned, it calls for "all the discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to that of the Basque country, which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the entry into office of Mas are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The old-age care secret confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not rule out that their nurse killed over 11 older people
The leaders of La Caritat's old care home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage that the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution during his work.
The head of the old-age care home, Joan Sala, was in court with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation because it had not established the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was going back to August 2009 and that he had been killed since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old-age care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were made by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point all the time and stated that "any remaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there would be no evidence of negligent actions by a person other than the accused."
The 11 murders that were already committed as a "death angel" before yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of the staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with the death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned it out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done, according to the confession, in three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat one does not believe the statements of the nurse, not even in terms of the number of dead murders that could be more than that. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
Threat of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday responded strongly to the threat of the President of the ECB, Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk increases of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be wrong and that the euro has hardly added to points that cause concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it is collapsing, is recovering, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of public debt, as they were ineffective, and the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least to March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to buy bonds to continue and to issue a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday's markets will be thrown back again and if we are halted to the fact that we are taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not consider the purchase of state debt and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, thus provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year-old national titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The government's capital management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million in the short term and possible another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get the parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, the reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock market.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all the doubts about our debt-making capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it is not only the being, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen is to challenge the Vega Sicilia Shareholders' Assembly
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the Eulen and El Enebro societies, does not fly off.
David Álvarez, the founder of the company's belt, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void." His children will try to get a majority to control the company's administrative bodies - the owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter in their dispute for the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem willing to give in to the control of the organs of El Enebro in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already in the trade register.
The meeting of the members of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Commercial Court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has created a new thunderbolt in the family Álvarez.
The appeal of the judge to order the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - in order to have the undeclared assembly of 18 January," as official speakers say.
This argument is the basis for the opposition of the Assembly in a subsequent way, in order to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who are in discrete silence, tried to convene a meeting in the right way in June without success.
At El Enebro - the property company and the owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background to the matter that the judge has to decide on in the hearing on the action for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since the end of 2004, Red Bull has been the world of Formula 1, and its history has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes in this learned universe.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and, despite his steep rise in the course of the last seasons, at the end of November, all of them put on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without trying to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This information program, called the PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to produce or simulate a product or process in a true way before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements that are recorded on the races and in the tests can design and perform.
Russworm states that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the race stables, which could make a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
The Red Bulls team now employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager said that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all the components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which only Renault is responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems and high-tech car claves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars a Formula 1 team can spend on his races in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a place 50 km from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially from journalists - are very limited.
All that's happening there is Top Secret.
The staff consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls' true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
The enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation in the race tracks hide further protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose knowledge is equal to zero.
The company's head of technology, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the R & D area for racing cars contributed 50% to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology is 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they "are not predictable gladiators."
HP will open 20 own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the converted shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working with him for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are offices in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopening, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales point network was intended to "provide customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and after that, even to optimize the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with a guarantee.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed in particular for small and micro-enterprises as well as for private customers, because the large companies already have their technical service contracts," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to "steal" his rivals in three years' time.
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first of all rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesizes the end of the debt war.
However, it envisages a fall in the interest rate margins which the banks are trying to compensate for with increases in the fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject that is still to be found.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years and thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the FROB's public aid, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you take off the customers that will lose the bank - that is the big challenge that this bank is facing, because up to now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the Bank faces will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has made all the plans of the banks all mixed up around the world.
This year, Sabadell will complete its "Optima" flagship plan, which was initially designed for three years, but was extended for one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year with a great range. "
The manager assumes that Spain only "slowly" came out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years' time - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will pass, the risk increases that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity will already be reduced to the price of loans as a compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and will put pressure on the loans."
"We did not turn the cock off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued the order to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently following the status of "increasing the fees," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's central plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he ensures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change next year," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and did not exclude the fact that some Spanish financial institutions are going to slip into red figures.
He considered that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of captal increases.
After he assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dismissed the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but, unlike the events in June, short-term funding could be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be stopped.
CECA excludes a second wave of merger of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on taking part in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather were adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seven, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managers and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process was "carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit set in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have met the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "There are a number of uninformed opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed" unseriosity and insanity, for "Banco de España urges us to close by the end of the year."
Yesterday, the Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world and added that those who questioned it "did it without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic situation we need to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have been through a "very important" concentration process that "will be carried out as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of State, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be assumed that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, three possible ways out of the crisis are started in Germany.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South should leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - even though it now sounds more like science fiction -, supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that exceed the targets; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been on the table for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German government was out of the question of constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the conflict between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel's decision to save Greece was a painful one.
This was strongly criticised at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be saved while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was designed as an anti-European one, as it was driving the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures are to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the countries that are in conflict will be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves unable to pay and, in this case, the private sector will have to pay part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass in more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change anything.
Among the options that are being considered, it is that we should not be excluded from the euro area that is full of little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rule-abiding
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion of two real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsporty act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will perform the required penalty at the next game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who in his hymn of nobility and honor, and who had punished his players for similar events on other occasions) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are a rule-abiding approach. In fact, this approach is based on the statutes of sport, but it seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused by the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players draw an unjustified benefit from the counterteam. That also did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by misplay or bypassing the rule, because the circumference of the rule was not secretly executed in order to avoid a penalty, but should be as conspicuous as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and welcomed the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the opponents draw from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival has not been placed in a less favourable position or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also get out of the game. In addition, the players will get a penalty with this approach and go to the second card cycle, in which they are leaving for card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
This does not make it so clear whether it is really an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule-abiding), they would rather choose when they would submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or fleeing from a punishment.
Although the limit between the gift of invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic was created by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provocative transfer of rules.
The damage that has been done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering to the customer for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar will drop an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The parties paid by employees themselves are spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group evenings in the pre-Christmas season that lead to the Barcelona restaurant and leisure industry oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price-offering to capture the customer segment, which is the big mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations that are asked to do so confirm.
To make the accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top students (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group evenings for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
However, as the economic situation is, low prices are required, the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant body, Gaità Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a lot before they reserve it."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well where "offer the quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are being asked for the most by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 December will lead the providers to collapse.
The Sotera group says that the requests for this Friday would boast with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the owner of the calendar has led to advanced reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's price with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local authorities, one does not lose the optimism after the second quarter of the year the revenue is reblooming and good, though concentrated, prospects for the Christmas business are seen.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euro or more as a prize shit. The impression is that the customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group food is back on track.
For the Fecasarm roof-side (with mergers such as the Barcelona Kneipen, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "lively," although the customers "make a maximum impact."
The fun at the party did not fall, however, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme arouses great concern in the United States
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Disclosure of Wikileaks confirms Taliban-Pakistan relations.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of the clear and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad offer, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "diminishes," and that the unstable Asian country "produces more nuclear weapons" to a faster rhytmus than any other country.
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their parts are stored in order to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the Taliban-attacked area, the suspected proliferation of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is not only seen by the United States, but also by Russia as a source of exuberance and reason to be careful.
"Pakistan has to hire strictly believed staff to monitor the nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said Yuri Korolov of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assang's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation is declining and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a message office, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the Supreme Head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify to the responsible person" that "Pakistan's army must stop its tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high-level leader in the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning for the persecution and detection of Assange.
Everything that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the facts can only be easily clarified.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order to be arrested.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not notified until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the power.
This is how things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many Member States consider the red warning to be a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
The approach was disgraced by Assanan's lawyers who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor, who received the appropriate authorisation with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is in charge of the innocence of her son - Assange is in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of the Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite place. In the interview, he requested the resignation of the U.S. State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we should place value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-level anti-terrorism leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt by the speaker of the President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions of conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate their funds and to track anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, who let information slip through the government, he is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is a vain punishment," he explained to the station Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with an eye wink to the Carod near
The Republican leader allows the party to have a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet is proposing a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe in order to avoid, for the most time, an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC without a direction after the loss of 11 Members and half of the vote.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient to the close of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same head break as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a wink of eyes, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning of yesterday, it was announced that the more than 200 regional members of ERC could make a secret statement about his stay in office.
With ballot cards, not with a high hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subjection among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without a percentage, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod close ones demand the President more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force the resignation, they will agree with the board of directors a plan of action from now to May.
For this purpose, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the Council for the vote on the 18th.
Her intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to move the Congress to the autumn of 2011, which the party's head already thinks is a fact.
The party president of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" is a damage to stability and he is once and for all seeking to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació considered it a fact that the party president was "supported in exchange for different objectives."
He counted five of them, two of them in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a function.
In this way, he is fighting for a reform of the statutes to allow the congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, who already fought for it at the last two congresses as possessed.
In fact, at the 2008 meeting, the party leadership was entrusted with the review of the principle of full assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle the internal rest of the last few years has not been advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors being on the verge, the time could have come to take this matter up again and to end it forever.

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China at COP16 said that his country had made a huge effort to reduce carbon leakage and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16, assures.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made a huge effort to reduce carbon traces and to change its industry.
He stated that in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contains the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving objectives, the effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
He also explained, has already been launched or completed a number of multiannual plans, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, it referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and which had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another to exchange the traditional light bulbs with energy savings and another to weaken and adapt, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were much greater than would be generally accepted.
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China were six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20% over the last five years and a further progress is to be made by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party president had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento had been right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he said that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that had been taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordnungscommission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to address the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidate had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge from the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a pretext for the local election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN looked back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would give the season "to those that the Council would decide."
"I am very concerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's upturn in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into it and I am sure Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them if they finally get out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the Federal Government could make expressions like those he could do in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no ban on the mouth in that country and even less a censorship.
Obama is working in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short communication contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document, which calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of the tax reductions from Bush's times and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could have an impact on the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The president, Robert Gibbs, asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, said that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be established.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement about this at any time and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which could be used to vote on the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate from next Thursday, would be more likely to be next week.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Act of the American Dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who entered the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while they have lived in that country for the last five years and are registered at a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their back on the initiative.
Among the most renown Republicans are the Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placerees de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentinean writer spat in love to the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, which was moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz then identified as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to know what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive an answer, but is the guide to her story.
She leaves the intractologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story sieves and concludes that it "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But it is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely story, which he called 'praise of invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-travelled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn of words and reported about America, the great novel, which was not missing from the beginning of his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquests.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witness who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even got rid of the shame."
However, he points out that "it is the crazy and the liars who think things are best," and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the Fil's invitation to the Round Table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertorian devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence affecting their country - like all Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment," she said, after she had stressed that literature is communication and commitment that are built between the author and the readers as if it were a "chemical reaction."
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "raised this finger of the committed writer in the author's wound."
He noticed that in a fast-moving world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run out on dogmatism, and is forgotten that "there is a little no behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuanced: and Nuanciers often meant to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final game, there are also two different styles in front of each of their respective trainers, and their encounter with the opposite is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ups and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinean has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has left behind the winners one step behind, and surprisingly he has played with the same team consecutive final games.
The santistic stratege reached the first final in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins with which he had a major defeat against Toluca at 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost to Rayados at 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put his title in, but in the end three of his players missed the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablo Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be followed again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my affection, which is why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," said the tax man, when you ask him about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two elfmeters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by the shooting of the Elfmeter, does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get in the shooting of the Elfmeter, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it won't happen."
It is in Romanso's power to be no longer a second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Before their conversation with the consulate, the persons must introduce themselves to the services for the visa application; the costs will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most of the applicants will have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their conversation at the consulate.
The ASC staff shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new process has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the handling of the visa are falling, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the time-limit, the processing of the visa application and the transport service that the document is handed over to.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the current rate of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for traders and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa need not have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to imagine at the next ASC where they submit their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who request the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service fee of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, see: http: / / mexico.usembassy.gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1: 00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would "present a supervisory finding for the search for alien life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments, which one previously thought to be uninhabitable, there could be human-like creatures. The hypothesis was that they could turn into intelligent beings, like humans, if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances of other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere may increase in similar life.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual range of its fund at the press conference tomorrow, on Thursday.
The geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, is taking part in the conference and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just started, and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergucia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed, which was an independent one. The four of them called into question the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the beginning of the inaugural meeting in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergecia, Ezequiel Reynolds Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were waging against the reform of the organ law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number of parties that controlled Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had introduced their political position with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that they would start from the political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take back the views of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergucia said that there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that an eternal two-party system should rule in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other Members to make them more," said the Convergence Member.
Ezequiel Reynolds Esparza of the PT, in an allusion to PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress has currently turned into a 'prey' for two.
"Before, it was just one party, now they split it up to two."
Mr Patrón Montalvo asked for respect for the Members and for their place in the negotiating table.
"It is not possible to leave out five, which will probably be nine Members, because the five that are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place on the negotiating table, because it is because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others that we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
A further check on just over 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical material is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200.144.56 peso with the number 9258447 on the last 16 November with the purpose of "accounting open accounts."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at overpriced prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "showed up" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is called into question by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourism companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the break-in of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in a bad condition and to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Union, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and the ways had a negative effect, as the tourists came to the sling and saw the mess, and then they turned their back on the nearby shops.
"The politicians do not know what it means to close a company one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not do the construction work in this way slowly and without planning."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid that such a thing happens again. How should it do it? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we too have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look uncared and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions are constantly being shot," he added.
"These arrangements have not been paid enough attention, and this type of incident is only what is clear to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Propoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought together with the city to the foreman. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory that we are promoting for this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take on the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a dignified Parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM, which makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and to the different social groups that are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of party and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members take on the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free of agreement between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they will turn into carnival agreements between the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, for it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them during the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people was the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary importance to the public budget in order to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects need to be allocated funds, state security needs to be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
Holy King is sought
The children of the family Coronado Valenzuela wish for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three-king day, because the household is no more and no less than 12 persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are called because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go with the gores to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one year old.
"(José Alfredo) said to me," I want this monster so much, "but I answered him," let's wait, boy, "because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has a size of 12; the 10-year-old Jesse has a size of 10, while the 8-year-old Miguel has a size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair of 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Nooeste.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Eindustrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of them from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons must have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke judicial building.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, of the possession of cannabis for sale, of the conspiracy and of the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has made it possible for us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estria of the security police of the Quebec, the Sherbrooke police service and the Memphémagog police force had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be followed without any problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be approved after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am holding with a party that has put chains on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person who has been identified as being a transport of illegal immigrants for up to one year, would lose the Canadian legal and freedom version as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he would not be able to support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party do not stand up enough to the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives, because it seeks the blame of the refugees and keeps children in prison for at least a year, "said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with the politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal events that concern Canada and which treat the country as a foot-and-mouth."
"They expect Canada to take hard measures," said Minister Kennedy.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative said to the Agency QMI that the government would call a vote to ensure that every opposition Member immediately declared himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has been in possession of a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutil, this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as a "out-of-the-hat rabbit" and "well-built solution at the end of the table."
In turn, Minister Dutil had addressed those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity that is in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he satisfied to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a teacher of ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposed to the Quebec that the financial audit be given a special mandate to enable it to carry out appropriate research on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec could give the audit authority the same power as the Commissioners, which would also allow them to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Government of Charest.
The Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better suited to this kind of crime.
This question was raised by the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During the 2001 operation of Printemps, which concerned the groups of the motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangster.
rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers continue to be under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region, took place.
A road has fallen into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, there have been strong rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
This was where up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down.
As the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is to be added to these rainfall, the crossing of several water courses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Ahigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière are here the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was demolished due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and closely monitors the situation, says Security Council Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec National High Water Centre, for its part, issued on Wednesday warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Ahigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly justified
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social care and Haitian, as well as because of his unusual speech about radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements would have "provided inaccurate information on social care and unjustifiably negative representations of the Haitian people and also such an unheard-out speech that is not appropriate to the daily broadcast."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who have committed suicide is contrary to the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the "front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Quebec."
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid and misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont was of the opinion that the suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of board members had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the possible consequences of the" Dupont le midi "programme would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-just and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not impudent to his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-effective discussion in this regard, which had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated in favour of Haiti's aid, as it would not be known with certainty whether the people in need would really receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitian people.
"I have already lost my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virginal for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denies the spread of an unheard-of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, should have notified its decisions once during the main time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montaler Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who is brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxes and in Thai boxing, is now increasing in the search for new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting in Algeria 12 years ago, like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, because for those who do not like the ground fight, such as the mixed martial arts, competition in North America are rar. "
Recently, the one who worked as a security officer as well as the company UPS had given bad news to his rivals, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs, held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact Kickbox and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category had been invited who had placed in the last World Cup among the first four."
"I got a baby in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I was in the back of Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines that come from China, where fists and footsteps are allowed as well as floorboards.
The two fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a box ring.
The most famous boxing fighter, who has emerged from this type of martial arts, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here in the Super-Tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic pfendsson.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinin (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semi-final of his category (80kg) he had won his first fight before he lost in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four participants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will stand up to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without a call for tenders
Hydro-Québec has, by mutual agreement, granted project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a total of 295 million dollars without a call for tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a corollary to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to transfer this important, hydroelectric project to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium took the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition and increases prices.
"This is a new way of playing a game that has been signed off and is unraveling the competition."
"This means that, instead of playing the cards in a secret way, you are now doing it in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public's interest can be used in this way.
In the afternoon, the Minister for Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had responded to it by vehemently disputing that this contract would have been a signed game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she wager, insisting that the PQ had "been wrong" and "lack of hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid to a call for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work size.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the possibility of a competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects, is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" said last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, is due to the same legal person, that is, to Dessau.
As regards the "Énergie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
"If you make a call and there are only a few candidates, your prices will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The thought, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
This contract, approved by the "Énergie gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are a total of $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Quebec are well known."
Minister Normandeau had made it sound that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that it "financed" before it specified that it was rather its managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-building
Green, but skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also in the marked brands or eco-labels that are to control its choice.
It is a pity, although it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it is just as full of information for a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacy that is evident as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebec still seems to be paying little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the people of Quebec admit that they do not believe in the environmental performance of the companies as well as the green business advertising, so the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke is a betrayal.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are declared to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebec's declared performance of the green products and services, which they are being tried to use, is depressing.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% of purchases from merchants of their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally-conscious consumption had reached a maximum of 64 this year - the home consumption of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of the Quebec have indicated that in 2010 they have used public transport or preferred the passenger centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The opening and cycling were also supported by 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive policy survey that feeds the cliché ideas.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was called upon by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped to give a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard, in order to return to its actual cinematic function, do not seem to receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond of less than the initially expected amount, which could create a viable solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be removed from the state food.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, and the request for requests has been corrected down again in terms of numbers.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who runs the eXcentris file.
A few days ago, he had sent her a last report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallel and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, the premise of the donation of the state seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinemas had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he did not give to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, claimed substantial and economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, the director Daniel Langlois had presented the car engine in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years in great difficulty, which could justify the exemption from the State Treasury.
The lack of cinema halls that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele on the stand.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are in turn operating a privately funded campaign, of which they hope to have a total of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvoi's "Des hommes et des dieux."
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not withdraw the newspaper "Le Devoir," and he and his group were ignored by the proposals that were made to them.
The secret of the complex shaken Canada
The new, American diplomatic lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, were the secret of what the United Nations considers to be a minority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the feeling of the latter's superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have the meaning of Canadian-American relations in the course of the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere material content to which one has to roam.
A link dated 22 September 2008, that is, in the period during which the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various possibilities for explaining this situation.
"A minority complex that is almost inherent in the Canadiens may lead the Canadian, political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concluded, is therefore "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "should it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the approach."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a 30 to 40 billion dollars experience programme," explains Breese.
He had not mentioned that the government had to adjourn the Parliament's meeting before Christmas to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the so-called continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed training programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by the Ambassador Wilkins, states that Washington is becoming more and more negative about the fact that the dramatic series broadcast through CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also distractions for the purpose of interviews carried out by the CIA's muscle-protégé.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clints had asked Bernard Kouchner, at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case by case decision.
The end of the meeting, as described, "he has given a paper to the Secretary of State in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to look through the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds are heated with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close-standing consultant, had explained through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He was talking here about Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of the lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the specific major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of the developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW released on earth due to the lighting, if the white-glowing pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the major exhaust gas issuers, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of CFCs from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020, in order to prevent it from going out of control.
In the white-glowing pears, 95% of the energy is in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy demand is reduced again by two times.
The compact light bulbs hold on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those which Philips has put on the market this week - this society has, by the way, taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white light bulb, which is an indication of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that its completely new light bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves as they contain mercury and that they need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that the producers provide a point of acceptance.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal power plants, which are emitting much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glowing pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants release 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is excited to expect the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press speaker from the UN Chief.
"It invites all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results have been announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world were made, and the CEI may at last call the name of the winner of the second round of the election under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is expected to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the manoeuvres of the FN to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's followers from voting.
The whole election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the North, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he did not go that far to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, as he knows that he has lost; and to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election committee has been prevented from publishing the results, see it illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for these in the event of possible outcasts.
Laurent Gbagbo had left the first round on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
For the purposes of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The second quarter data were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were operational or not every two weeks, or whether they were seeking employment or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25%, including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
In turn, the seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-old, 6.6% with the involvement of the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), an investigation was initiated and he was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with the suppression of social assets, the embezzlement of general goods, the heresy, the complicity in corruption, the illegal bribery and the possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, rather than spreading brain spines."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Raul of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had stressed the importance of giving the judge a memoradum for his justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill he had to run.
He would never have known about the business area or the location of the associated funds, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for the suppression and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and were released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the waste disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted by "unauthorized influence and passive bribery."
Two officials of the Aubagne conurbation area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "Retrieval and imperation of general goods by a public service officer," the other because of "co-perpetration in the event of public money being misused."
The life-mate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "lifting and suppression of social assets."
One of the people facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested for a similar public-sector affair of fraudulent activities that affected Corsica.
The prosecuts suspect his society to have helped to wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the area of disposal, will be carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It is clear from close investigation sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the award and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its central function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public in breath, put diplomacy in the alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and passed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner of France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way to deal with hostages."
François Richier, Elysée's strategic adviser, was with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, accompanied by Patrice Paoli.
They explained the French method to her.
They told the Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own nationals, who would be held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without delay" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more so, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
For "silence does not solve anything," the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richie added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to be achieved on 16 August, on the day on which it fled to the French Embassy) "would require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro deposit).
And he lets the Elysée anticipate further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "get worse."
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran in the near future," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is calling for to Iran for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this worrying co-incidence.
For Washington, who is following the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, then restores it, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "were currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts to make "escape attempts" by means of statements and media-organised "attempts," Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential" role.
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and realize that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summons up "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy is wondering.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée has led to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "perceived as premature and unserved by numerous critics in France and abroad."
"Building the Syrian role" Paris "tries to show Syria the reward that can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thank them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Cinderella," which will prevent the young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them access, so the government's leaders indicated.
A draft law to call on online game operators to refuse access to these games for young people under 16 years after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, the representatives of cultural and family ministries described.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure its health and the right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency's representative in charge of this draft law.
The online games were again available from 6 am.
The manufacturer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government also looks forward to asking manufacturers to cut the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible one added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA Appoints the Exchequer
On Thursday, the Executive Committee of FIFA, in the light of the suspicion of corruption, will appoint the World Championships' countries of origin 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however, is that the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself in 2010 after the premiere of the African continent, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of economic and political use of a world championship.
So the power behind the scenes is threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to draw up a hierarchy of candidates otherwise.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than that of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynolds Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as well ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only once allowed to hold the World Cup, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again given the ground for cultivation on Monday by sending out a documentary report, which is taking three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had conducted an intensive lobbying in these last few weeks in the first place with David Cameron.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train, which was successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive commitment be enough to revalue the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any debris with its already finished stages, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the opportunities of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering reference to the English press's "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw them in dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin waged.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's 2026 approval of the World Cup for China, which has been called out by FIFA, which has lost Asian opportunities to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the maintenance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is following its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, for certainty is.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA, which the European countries have acquired.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really tipped.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate at the Elysée will call the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well on the side of the mystery that is attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt is over.
On the one hand, as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's followers stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in serious Tone assured to make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that on Tuesday night in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians he would make the perspective of "two mandates" seem to have spread a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President just reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than on the day before, but no less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS call for early than assumed to be a battle announcement.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded directly and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he had a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," Alain Juppé, who has turned his back on the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state documents
The last meeting of the ECB 's Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the establishment of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is committed to the fact that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to deal with the current, more than tense, situation in the European bond markets, in order not to cause it to deteriorate.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, yesterday at a press conference, welcomed the active role of the ECB in the solution of the European public budget debt.
It did not dare to say whether it was of the opinion that the central bank could do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very speaking on his projects during his hearing in Brussels on the occasion of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but rather was pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of state papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "how the decisions are to be made."
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its central rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled the debt purchases of the Treasury to around EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to some traders, it was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt about the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price among the dealers (see page 29).
The people are no longer expecting a remarkable change of course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB 's arsenal, the latter will still be able to create the full money reserves in a voluntary way over a period of one week to three months.
The people are already working on the fact that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the commercial bank's economist.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, a national economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that will revive the market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area public debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at all costs to the players of the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm of the returns paid to the weakest states," said an important commitment holder yesterday.
For if interest rates were to start a high flight, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a week of worrying for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the fall in the central interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indecibable" and had heard him expect a "unforeseeable" weekend, but the person concerned immediately denied it.
In any case, on Tuesday the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had led to a certain lack of head in Rome.
In its Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out that Spain's discrepancy at the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, a national of the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, this means that its problem is the reduction of economic growth and the associated, swindling tax revenues that put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, although the budget available to the Senate for the examination is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is why the call for a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we have been repeating that for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is calling for lower stabilisation progress than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's head economy.
The question of political impotence remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was still shown on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction from the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about the beginning of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly dependent on the banking systems," the opinion of the people of Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, since "political time is much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and of the danger that is hidden in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB will meet today.
The plan sets out the unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the euro-zone countries in the cross-border of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not to provide explicit funding, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first ad hoc expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States to support a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are sending themselves to take on structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are to be added to the austerity measures, but which are to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other are at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budget corrections and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the way through in Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take it back into its own pocket.
Barclay's capital, with regard to the European public debt market, judges that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct rate of liquidity.
This means that the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion, is in place.
An advisory board that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are on the increase.
Snow and smooth teas: 24 departments in alert level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the orange alert due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alert level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers dance to the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow ceilings are expected from 2 to 5 cm, and from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic problems and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the region of Côte d'Armor, several regional roads are closed for heavy goods transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who are not advised to use their own vehicle only in the emergency, and the use of some TER-buses has been deleted all day.
In the Picardie the school traffic for Thursday was lifted.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on the drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to remove 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in the south of London and the Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start the construction of the SGP, the State has declared a capital injection of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give in the markets a part of the financial amount to its double.
Today, it has finally come to the first high-cost accounts.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the development and higher taxation of offices in the Ile-de France.
The first, which is taken from Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is indicated: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a rearrangement of the already existing company taxation: "to modernise it, to increase the product resulting from it, and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that mean?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not indicated in the text.
You're a long way from the 4 billion.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital dotation provided by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris are gradually provided for the project," the explanatory statement is to be found.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment you have recorded revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R), you can cover the projection for over three years and then you can only get out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions will be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a rather moved, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge-like hackers and powerful spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in sensual hypocrisy that governs the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in a row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi are nothing more than what you've been reading in every x-any magazine for months (except for the one whose owner is Berlusconi) and the terrifying caricature profile Gaddafi offered cabaret artists for a long time for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (over the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzler) is exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same is true of the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognises to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of these files made?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centres.
Every single viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state's government.
In addition, the scandal does not bring the victims, but rather the "snipers" into trouble.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell's times, you could pool all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be completely correct, where one can control every movement through the phone, every transaction, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you are aware of what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a citizen's revenge - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this infirmity that has been inflicted on such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be the same as a wall attached to the street corner.
But it is also obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their communications nowhere else but in the mere memory, and in addition, hiding the few written information they have received in the set of shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: in fact, the attempt to spy Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like a cancer today, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band, in which one could roll forward from the back and air all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today do not allow anything other than to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macropositions.
With the high-speed trains you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the implementation of the fast-resolution financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine-tuning companies are exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed report of the Member States' actions, press conference, major side events, the distribution of brochures.
The operation transparency is remarkable and well appreciated for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces its release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will bring it on the right track to pay for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without being to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and will provide 150 million for the "fast-start" funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar targets, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decline) - France is committed to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about that, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 loaned €as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously this is difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the reduction of emissions, based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the capital country should be considered as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country to use large-scale loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) carry out their 100% commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France is just giving 10 cents and it means a similar commitment.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: part with a further development of the action over time and part with the reality of financial use.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once in the EU (why are the other Member States going to continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let them be completely deceived...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole debate on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the UNFCCC's immense machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balance of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another subject that is crucial and currently under discussion): it is not possible to escape the question of "predictability" or the way in which its loans are booked.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other cases in relation to the issues of dispute.
So hope is based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "predictability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken from children
A 10-year-old child takes on various chemical substances over the day 81, so a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in the light of the small number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value, but are an illustration of the problem being addressed," had bought between July and September the food usually consumed within four, from a about ten-year-old child to meals, plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day, have been examined as well as the dry-cleaning of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is degrading: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the near whole of the cases, it is very well taken from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors is worrying," the association notes.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possible carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended for the study as an intermediate meal, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study has identified traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also spilled.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues was the "richest," and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer is likely to be undervalued, "the study says.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the light of the urgency of the situation," to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
