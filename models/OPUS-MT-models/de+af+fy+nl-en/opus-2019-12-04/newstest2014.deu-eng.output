Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light was put into operation at the village parking lot - in view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or tortoise?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The Rathauampel was installed at the time, because it ensures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser light ensures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant was officially put into operation yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub '.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian volumes, another light had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about 10 percent are heavy traffic," Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light was more than necessary: "Safety is just going on here," Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but due to the narrow in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße was again rejected.
According to Arnold, it was tested at the location of the light mast before: "With an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden rods, we have tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the light mast."
The approximately 15 000 euro traffic light system itself is the "most modern what is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that are so strong that the lights can be easily seen by the drivers, for example, even in the case of the deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems use about 100 Watt, the new just eight Watt.
There are three light systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group or disabled people go across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safely on the road," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver had to think as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the light for pedestrians showed hardly green, a high-class vehicle ran through - in the case of bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the need for his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village child - the lack of speech, the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrow and joyless - the Carinthia poet has described many times.
The Büchner Prize-winner is known as a prose author, and theatre texts are very rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher, for his performance "Weather Lights on the Züngenspitze," which can now be seen in the garage X at Peterplatz, therefore a collage of Prosatexten.
The theatrician combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminities from "Leichnam, his family beauerning" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important provocation: a broken sofa, on which it is clearly copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overlooks the template with a wealth of lines, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
In particular, the actresses are involved in the sometimes questionable scenes.
They are touched hard, dipped under the water with their heads, hit the wall with their evening drawers.
Intangled in cell ophane or milking, they strike on dangerous high sticks through the production, either monologise them loudly or lie completely mute on the stage floor.
The text, however, hardly conveys itself in this tense way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end the overturned performance comes a little to rest, and Winkler's afterward absurd humor is inflating.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that takes place in the dashboard of every car.
The equipment that records every kilometer and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly opened up an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberators have joined environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the run-down kilometres - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax documents.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a procedure in Congress, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay for each mile.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It is nothing that we will only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the hit miles in all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by the US Americans at the gas column, is broke.
But in America, it's not as much gas as it used to be.
Cars use less gas.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare, at high prices, to raise the tax even to a cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most useful alternative in the long term," he said.
bureaucrats call it a mile-based user result.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal terms, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-sensitive exhaust gases.
The California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state of climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, president of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also affected by the idea of making drivers pay after the route has been completed.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reson Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a report in 2011, asked Congress to move towards miles-based settlement.
The US Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to spend many miles in everyday life on the way to work or to the city.
However, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it with trucks to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
"Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and result management in the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into an adult surveillance device."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the run-in kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
In that way, Khan said, the public would also be more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Milage in California.
The company originally did not start to help state states in the taxation of car drivers.
Rather, their goal was to take a stand in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the run-up miles.
But the devices it tested are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that are regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Milage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting to give drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the average miles run by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the equipment with more functions than with less.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax system that also allows parking charges to be paid, insurance must only be paid for run-in kilometres, and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid congestion.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers," it says in a planning document of the city.
Some transport planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on car drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of car drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team takes a wacker
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main sample in spite of the lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
In his practice, the department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate of Feder in Burgberger Straße.
There was a short-circuit in the sawing.
The resulting fire and the development of smoke hurt two people, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two of the wehr's air carriers were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and to go out.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for wood processing.
The first fire attack was carried out over the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made over an overflur- hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three firing attacks could be designed.
A hollow-beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what was to be done with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided via the daily use group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Interconnection of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, country president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers from tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he, together with the leading school leaders of the vocational schools and the district high school, and the parents' chairman, took up this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma-School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, the Walderstadt has been a successful cooperation between the support centre, the district school and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also, due to demographic change, to the period of care for family members," Wolf said.
He also mentioned that more and more employees were concerned with the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified labour, he said.
Another, particularly important factor was the networking of universities and enterprises.
"For those who have already met the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the country was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport is better," he said to the local politicians present.
With music experienced an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older people were taken care of in the rest room.
In the meantime, this afternoon is taking place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, had a good time.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße is to be put again on the renovation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, the first work on the restoration of the front school was built a small wall, for the stabilization and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further approach is to include the State Monument Office in the planning and to create a restoration concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine the further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the restoration, plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary in the foreseeable future to rehabilitate the necessary wall of the border and to put it on new base.
The historic, one hundred-year-old border wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße, is particularly needed by water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the school was planned to rehabilitate even in the years 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be supported by the State Museum.
If any of the requirements are to come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monuments.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now become involved.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News."
Jazz and classical music are part of the jazz location of Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is the favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on September 22, is opposed to the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is a new organization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop courses are to be moved from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super-Tunnel" to the drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" to drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig under the radar," said the U.S. State Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end to the tunnel.
"If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the context of drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth of the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence for life-long deprivation, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
However, it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug bands, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, Bill Sherman of the DEA drug detention in San Diego said.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, they said.
You have to count on imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned in 794 in writing.
A document was produced in churches, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official start to the Jubilee Year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned in 1250 years ago, in church houses.
During the anniversary, a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and in church houses.
In July, the church houses will be the 1250 on a festive weekend from July 18 to 20.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
The church-Hausener church festival is also on this weekend.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday party of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will be released.
"It is to be a chronicle not only of the hostages themselves, but a printed work on the hostage of today, which is made up of the hostages, the church houses, the bodies, the Aulfingen and the Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hensttler.
And the hostage of today is also celebrating 2014's birthday, and in 1974 the present-day space was carried out with the congregations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The fool tongue of Strohglonki starts on February 8 with an evening of need on the occasion of its 60-year existence, the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and on March 29 has the banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Musicverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the fountain festival from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then court.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 is that the municipality reform is 40 years ago.
Council takes the lead on track equipment
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be redesigned to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in his hand.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety at railway crossings - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to take part in the costs with one third of the costs and the rest will be shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing.
There the city plans to build a boulder at the height of the tunnel in the west of the railway.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those that transport long wood, could stand on the road without having to block the tracks.
The Greek authorities therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the following road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in a controversial way in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need to spread the road: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money on account of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was used regularly for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the line at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route was used as a reroute for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
In view of the fact that Kirchberg- and Schlossbergttunnel had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am" Hirschen could also be of important importance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to examine the costs of the planned expansion of the road.
Despite this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing, provided that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could, where appropriate, extend the following road to "Bahnhofstraße" for the traffic of the meeting to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns access to the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" which is very much increasing.
The administration had had the railway redesign plans examined by the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser Wegs was then possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out the possibility that the road's inclination could lead to longer vehicles being set up.
In turn, the city is responsible for this as a road-building carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to a dispute of liability.
Since both the wood removal and the turning worked in the current construction state, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transfer, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition was also significantly lower than at the other train crossings, because the centre stop is right next to the one with a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station should be so slow at this point that no collision is threatening.
The majority of the people refused to accept the conversion of the railway, because the city of Schiltach had to "bathe" the problem with the rolling stock, the councils said, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction was completed.
The body considers that the changes at the "Voor Heubach" and "Voor Kuhbach" railway transitions are unproblematic, for which cross-border agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now need to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far-off worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows if there's life on some of them at least.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after Earth-like planets, maybe to discover alien life?
These are the questions that the people responsible for the European Space Agency, Esa, are asking themselves.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are to bring the research to a decisive level.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas have been discussed, five of which have now come to the close.
A large number of bodies are looking at the proposals, and they are looking at the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, launched in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To address this question, the "Cheops" space telescope will be launched in 2017, which will further examine 500 already known planetary systems in our nearby environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could represent Earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is intended to give an idea of the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emanates with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
It may also be possible to find differences that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos were created by the big bang.
In addition to the common matter, of which stars, planets and living beings like us exist, there is dark matter, the gravity of which holds together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled for the start of 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chance of a L-mission authorisation has "E-Lisa," a demanding concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
This includes changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope to get behind the project.
The mission provides for a two or three-probe detector to be installed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves that were created during the big bang, and thus provide new insights on the development of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
There are already proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the American Intelligence Service, has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbels, he writes: "Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of faith and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the US Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister for the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said online to time: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this was possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a member of the Green, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbels stated that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden was to testify in Germany, he would need an assurance that he was "safe" there, the Member said.
In his letter, Snowden explained that he was facing a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had expelled him from his home country.
However, he was affected by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians, including in the United States, have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said you would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who only paid at the airport.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines started to charge for the first and second items of baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore put as much in the hand luggage as possible, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a piece of luggage free of charge on the platform of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed, so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they came to the platform.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about luggage allowances and other charges, but airlines are happy to use them.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage charges as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, have so far left the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first fee for hand luggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional fees.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit will bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to have a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the airport if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth things I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see some sign-off and practical discussions on the platform.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like a lubricant."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and that coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshments, but seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontier's step to charge the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase rather than via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone most far in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the route.
A third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can also only book places when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at his head office in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenues decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of women this year in the Evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Proverbs from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, received a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain ways of life, regulations or warnings," she said.
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like, "Be careful, as the scales fall from the eyes, and give an eye to someone who gives to his own in sleep, and wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the speaker also let her listeners guess what proverb it was.
The words from the Middle Ages were accepted by the church council of Christian Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, do something wrong.
She explained the importance and origin of the words she called "bridges to the past."
A Tombola was finally released.
The prices were covered on a table and were described humorously before they were handed over to the winners.

Learning rather than unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched today at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winter periods.
"It is new that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the New Brandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the firms would have trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency said on late Friday that a mistake has paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem was fixed that night.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman to ABC News had declared that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
The speaker said that secret information was not in danger.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website will collapse.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and looks at the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in the home and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October at 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Office for Labour in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to FeldBauer: "We have hardly any professionals in the craft, health and old-age care."
In the year-to-year period, employment offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been in place since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäu display sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profits in Bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit on Thursday, following a fall in orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next September.
Only three more start-ups were followed on the young flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results were behind the forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from "outperform" to "sector performance" in view of the limited potential of the share in the next one to two quarters.
"Although the number of aircraft was expected to be more weak, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the range in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the plane progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, binding orders for the CSeries at 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet are correct.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board of Directors Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the time of the aircraft, ground tests and software updates were used.
Every manufacturer is planning to be different.
We decided to take a first flight and then set up a reprocessing period, which we did.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was said from the company side.
However, analysts remain sceptical whether the first customer can start a CSeries aircraft 12 months after the young flight.
Bombardier stated that it would check the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even though it is obvious that they are in line with bombardments' internal planning - confirms our view that the start-up is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a fall of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The number of orders in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September, which was unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in the context of our targets, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The turnover in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board will change Patrick Pichette to the board of directors.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardment's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in the quarter profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown one fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport's management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security guard had also been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the situation, said the spokesman of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a shooter with a gun in one of the exit halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the transmitter CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children would have cried.
There was a panic among the waiting people that many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA security officer had suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
After that, he was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are supposed to have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On TV pictures there was a large number of hospital and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special action command and a gun on the ground.
As the airport line reported on Twitter, the incident started at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backstalls.
It was said that, except for landings, the air traffic had been temporarily stopped.
However, several aircraft were also observed at the start of CNN.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
The Los Angeles LAX Airport is a major airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug dependence might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was praised by criminals as "first-class" with the nickname "Bash," was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine to the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after the traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards had been found during tests.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitor in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Riverpool Crown Court following a three-week trial in two charges of the legal system.
He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers' football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine, after the tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the "law secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
In the police interview, he said he was running an office at his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was known that he had called important drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was able to counter the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore called his career into question.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any misconduct and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal the moment he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and is trying to get behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year existence, the Liederkranz Dunningen will provide two services of worship with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the "Rock my Life" musical, which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, the music will enrich two divine services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 am at the church of St. John Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Fair, with the original title "Singing to the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass," D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the formation.
The fair is performed in the framework of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind group of the music association Frohsenz Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism softens the vision of confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the pastoral unit Haslach (SE) will change basic legends.
There is then only a common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change about the basic decisions of the diocese, and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
During the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new softly but with confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, the regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the priest's power is represented.
Each parish is to represent at least two elected members, the six parishes in which so-called common deities are formed on the ground.
Their task will be to promote the ecclesiastical life in the place in the future.
In the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are to be maintained in a specific way.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the municipality as a whole.
In particular, with regard to the major planned investments, the commitment of which will then be made by all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes were invested," said Haslach's parish president, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "One to be, five to stay," and had to find that it is not that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher pastoral unit then asked themselves to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community deams.
The work will be concrete in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, the parish council of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the current is more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family has 70 to 90 Euro additional costs per year.
The main reason for the price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This charge will be refixed each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes.
They shall determine the additional costs which they incur from the energy transition, which they may raise by means of a levy over the electricity price.
The town works Ppullendorf are the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Energy Company's Supervisory Board had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete figures should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - drive in red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorcycle."
However, the waiting period had to be "appropriate," which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to wait for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the light is expected.
However, those who continue the journey in spite of the red light should be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you are patient for less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the light after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light failure.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a ban on driving because of the special situation - but not the fines.
The Council of the Communities is pleased about the sound budget
When it comes to the budget in municipal meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The community bag in Herschregen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been familiar with the debt since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success.
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around €1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the local share of the income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher introduction from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the reserve injection was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were very happy about the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that the citizens could soon be able to stand up to cost.
As a result of the good financial situation, the municipality was able to give up high lifting rates in the past.
In turn, however, according to Gerster, the country had already reduced its subsidies a number of times.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory amounts.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for aid must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investment will be needed in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nawold: Hugo Werstämter for 60 years in the choir
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on the stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years the singing with the now probably more than very well-won choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his commitment, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him a certificate of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, as the choir is also a church choir.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choral association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st fall festival was in the usual course: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music association the full margers had loaded a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which had the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, their brothers."
They prepared for their honorary singer Hubert Weramten a small festival - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundessong."
The men's singer Betra also sang classical choral songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley."
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulse choir" - the song wreath Salzstetten provided for the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir took the Neapolitan people "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "impulse" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home in the home, with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied," where the Volhlmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small program - "Nana Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperltheater and read a few stories that the children worked well for lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and refinement wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and children's crèches from the entire customs area can participate in the action.
If you have a desire for construction or improvement for your installation, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, chooses three wishes from all the entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many diligent builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves: what does Parliament stop simply from abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the paper, which does not consider the draft law to be constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, to which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites of Kenya.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be preoccupied, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, "effectively take the media into a spade." On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of speech in Kenya had "suffered a heavy blow," and called the draft "draconian."
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media took on the anger of the authorities because they published records of security cameras that showed how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded to this with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the summons were withdrawn after a press call.
Under the new law, media houses can be filled with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya, as they are described.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"Let politicians leave themselves, take the country to bankruptcy, and return us to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators had already raised public trouble.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their solid salaries of about 532.000 shillings into effect per month - they are one of the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will come true for the FC
The official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports field, despite the cold weather and the rain, did not lose anything of the importance for the city and the football club.
A more pleasant celebration session would have all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play in it.
So all those who came without an umbrella, or could not hold one for any reason.
This was the way for the musicians who framed the festival, as did some speakers.
Nass was also the president of the club Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His first thanks were to Mayor Walter Klump, who has been very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association who were involved.
This is especially Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the country's representative Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were expressed for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Badic Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth division of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that in the spring and autumn, the weather-related influences were always repeated in such a way that it could not be played.
As early as 15 years ago, there was the first thought to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of at the grounds of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the creation of an artificial grass sports place, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbacht, promised a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros, including Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-x 108-metre artificial grass square was started on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were carried off, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike-line.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, the transfer of Members and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include, among other things, the issue of double citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "flat rate for multiplication and therefore environmentally counterproductive," the SPD negotiator on transport, Florian Pronold, said in a letter to his group.
It threatened to evade on land roads, which are already major accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronold.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later stage," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday night on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was really a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for the drummer Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car drivers severely injured in the event of an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the way to Grefrath at 9: 15 p.m. with her car on the Kempen outside ring.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Töniser Street, she oversaw the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The foothills collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, at around 8: 00 p.m., on the left track of the two-track Reichenaustraße was driving to the city.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-wing trail in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
The BMW of a 23-year-old Constanzer came into being.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old who was driving behind the BMW.
A total of about 15000 material damage was caused, the police reported.
The track had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport Determines Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, the Vienna-Schwechat airport will no longer be able to tell the story.
A large part of the speakers' statements are therefore dropped - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation.
As the airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of statements concerning individual persons.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already do not give up the noisy calls.
The removal of these statements - on average, on one day, about 200 personal calls from the speakers - is intended to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual statements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight rises or departure times are going down a little," Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree-tree-throwing, horseshoe-throwing and water-egg-bearing.
Four and a half meters is the tree trunk long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It does not matter to the extent," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown down vertically, let it overlay and then come to the lying.
This is assessed with most points.
When throwing horseshoe, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away, a stake is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water-bucket carrying over 50 meters.
Time and water in a botech are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10: 00.
A suitable clothing is required, for example, the competitors can start in the rock.
But it is also allowed to be in the Swabian.
For the "Outfit" the jury still gives a few bonus points.
You can register until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already announced on the fixed site on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music friends come at their expense.
At 7: 00 pm, the bishopric bubble music from Schömberg is the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays flat polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes emotional waltz and a smooth big band sound.
With it will be the singing host and black-wurstbaron known as Heinz Koch of Weil among the Rins.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool's house.
On Sunday, the music club Leinstetten will have an early kick, from 2 am the Fürgerkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" will then make the festival sound out.
On Friday the party with DJ Ralf is already open.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Tailor meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheep shaving.
Especially for children there is a string zoo, straw hop castle, tractor riding (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The event is organised by the Förderverein multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele."
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Pried tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quartz set.
The Vegetarian Federation for World vegan Day on November 1 is also mentioned.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany is proposing a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World vegan day on November 1:
Pure plant margarine was a good alternative to butter, let yogurt be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, almond or rice milk could be used.
Stable seed of plants replace traditional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-crushed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
In place of egg, for example, the dough is loosened with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk pot can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding in Germany, that is, purely plant.
Sleeping in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the city's heart, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
A fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already available here, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it was over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of the 11th of September.
On the third day, the students were able to get an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373 m high observation platform of the Empire-State-Building, while enjoying the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay in the autumn sun for a short time.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
This year again, on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertmesse is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather reckless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn group of the hunting leaders of Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is music on parformation horns (natural horns in the mood Es) to old, originally French melodies.
The bladders wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany horsemen, horses and dog ducks on towing jagden in a musical way.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed top is shiny with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, the déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In case of a visit to the same-name café at the stop in the district town of Kleve in a visual distance to the University of Rhein-Waal it does not have to stay in the pure déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the aim: to make a real stay not only mentally, but hand-held, ever-recurring experience.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the elegant café at the top of the restaurant: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From the move to Kleve to the stop, the friendly café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"With which we do not have a specific target group," stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as much as the seniors and all the age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The friendly couple of owners is behind the coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot break in the most varied variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the express fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the port festival took place outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnacht evening.
"Nice, successful and funny," the two 33-year-old found.
But it's not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not an excellent fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the store in Kleve.
The road that is more and more becoming a gastronomy mile.
To the joy of many adhesives, the guests from close and distant and the students who discover the hospitality and thus also the café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165. Foundation party to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club hall of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate strength to perform honours.
This time, the special award "Singer of the Year" was pleased by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also made so many rounds for us, for which our warm thank you," said the chairman of the Chorus Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for the participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.

The board of directors addressed a special thank you to the team of the club's Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets on Tuesday at 7: 45.
"New gentle voices are welcome to us at any time," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that are due to expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives are to be agreed," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate, which I have been given by the Member States, in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without a win for four days, the Handball-Oberligiist still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated on the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what a victory is like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon warns the index finger in advance.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Youth.
That is why they will be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait to see if there is any backup from the first," the SG-Coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Above all in the work on cover and in the change of the game it was a huge thing.
There is also a need to improve the use of opportunities.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique, in order to agree to peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and on Thursday the crowd on the capital's independence square.
For two weeks now, there have been reports almost daily about the clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the Rhodesia government of White and later by the South African apartheid government in the attempt to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict, but the recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, there is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal leagues in the north-west could bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional town of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, as government forces attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government is blaming Renamo for the clashes and accusing the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he said to ADP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo renders the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Early discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been caused by a number of clashes this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are beating the heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating, and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election sequence has been shrinking since 1992, while a new party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want a transparent election, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has taken a disturbing attack on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable streets," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools," so Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-just works.
"I find it wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are "excessive didactic," children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "submissive."
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be submissive, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakab moves again in Freishof
A hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakab took his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday, his last years came to life in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short-and-short-two-stage game.
From the arrival to the award of the honorary citizenship to his death, the screenwriter and Hansjakobbstoffer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which was directed by Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesperson through the ten different scenes, explained links and bridged time jumps from youth to the near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakab comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shone in his paraderolle as the great son of the city.
He performed with the two-spanner and "Schwarzälder Föchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her an incredible life in the mimics and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbach Fürrenkapelle played suitable selected pieces of music and finished the performance.
For the award of the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor that, in the representation of the then official owner of Hätich, together with a part of the city council, made his maintenance.
The three-king-singers, who led Hansjakab to the exclamation, then made their wake-up: "Oh, how beautiful, there are again young memories of my own three-king age."
With their song "O Jesulein," they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork-day children with their loud "out, out."
His criticism of the church at the time was as much expressed by Hansjakab as his concerns about the emigration of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home land, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praising words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giant is growing
The chances for the remaining league of the sports-off Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
For if there is a wild card procedure, there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project renounces an application for a possible rear seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has drawn up the concept of a proficlub in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard process until it was established that Düsseldorf did not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, the ascender Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the Rhine countries have been refused the licence twice.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening church is at the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public theme tours this year on Sunday, October 27, the Supper Church.
After the visit to the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerlocher period after 1850 is to be considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The closing point of the coronary is a visit to the church of the Supper.
There the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the Evangelical community in a through and through the Catholic area.
Not least, the church also has a view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an orginal reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half hour tour is at 3: 00 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
There are maps at the register of the nuclear celler museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the City of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US scout.
Representatives of the Federal General Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This notified the Interfax Agency by calling on unnamed circles who are familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be resolved at intergovernmental level.
A trip to Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was an ally of the United States, it was said that Snowden was in danger of being delivered there.
Long breath is paid
Six men's teams fought for the title of the winner in the tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier / Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the front of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlechter runs the tournament
The tournament line was in the proven hands of Anja Schlechter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were the same as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to hand over the "Wanderpokal" to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target line.

At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful sound of the tournament took place.
At the end of August, the Black Forest Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach bei Hornberg is again in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes the visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous participation and events.
"Large and small can learn different old crafts on both days," it is said in the press release.
Whether to make soap, turn candles, filter or make ropes, the right thing to do is for each age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
In the museum workshop is also worked.
The young guests can prove their craftsmanship in the construction of cuckoo peppers, water wheels or chalks.
The many old games also promise a lot of fun, such as car racing or stelting.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 2 pm each.
At a time of change, the children must guess which stories are true or are still a lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found on the grounds and are to be admired.
In addition, all children are allowed to look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be driving his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, it is cozy and fairytale with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3: 00.
In addition, the Gutach children's group will perform traditional dances at 11.30.
In addition, on both days of the event, many craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seaman, the spinner, the weberin and the baker can be seen over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable cow, because he has undertaken to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not to be taken away from his dream in spite of a heart failure.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cakes.
Schrilles beepsen is disturbing residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard, among other things, relies on wind plant logistics.
Black shines the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue shearing and recharging devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the transducers move, a loud warning sound sounds over the ground.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is far from being heard in the event of an unfavorable wind - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the actions very seriously and has therefore contacted the people concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now time to keep the warning signals down with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on the coal import for power plants and is one of the major in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5-metre-deep vending machine in front of the terminal, Capeside-Bulkcarrier can also be finished here.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark at the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport line could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism of the basketball team of the FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night with title defender Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European Royal Class, the Münchner sold very well for a long time, but in the decisive phases it was simply not clear enough.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a tour before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We have been incredibly fighting back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made a slight mistake again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
In the first two games, Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful shipyards of the Munich, who had won a significant victory in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title-bearer Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of New York comedy festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: just a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd a direct joke in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation was developed, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
In the life called and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution of Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and great theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were at some point too well known to play at a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are performing.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the Comedians who are taking part in the festival this year have become known by rather unconventional means, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the group at both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironical W. Kaumau Bell, focused on racial issues) are products of the decentralised world of the American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and he thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vets and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of recent years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dshawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Playgrounds with Machete
Two children admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body in a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They would have played football in front of their apartments in a working area.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who had taken her, was to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the date of death before the police without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.

The pimp has to go to prison
The Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison because of exuberant trafficking in human beings, pimp, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the framework of a process agreement.
He therefore met women in five cases through Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women who, for some years, bought it.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contacts between women and the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brodels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he suffered a serious trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and therefore a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the damaged women.
As a Cripo official reported, after a first complaint by telephone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of trafficking in human beings could be identified.
The interlocutory discussions had been marked by high aggression.
In later hearings, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality," which considers violence and exploitation to be normal in this metier.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has disbanded from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after he was arrested," he said.
Oil price continues up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference quantity for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in Europe in the late morning in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has affected prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, which had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop and freshness directive
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop and search program ("stop and search") of the New York police department, and untied the judge of the case.
The Second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Schendlin were suspended until a decision was taken on the city's appeal.
The judge had in August ruled that the city was in breach of the Constitution by the way in which the programme for the detention and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the appropriate training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments for the suspension requested on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case as it had violated the code of conduct for US judges by establishing that a judge should avoid the appearance of party; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which it had publicly responded to the Court's criticism.
The judge had guessed that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inadequately targeted to black and Latin American men with the stop and freshness program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service supervision, and appointed a pilot programme with body-carried cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fresh tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the term of office of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to an always high of 684.330 in 2011, most of which are black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of which were minorities, were brought to justice, which developed into a collective situation.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop and freshness programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
Opposites believe that the changes would dampen police morality, but not crime; also would waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police force that has been under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-freshness practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD controls are implemented.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can achieve only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hande."
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the applications were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nawold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to act in an advisory capacity at the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn, in the record time of almost a week, created the Sick Station in Sorogim, a poverty district on the edge of the capital - voluntary.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic is to be wegraatized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical doctor, Henne says, for example, a withdrawal against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not do as many trips as you planned, but for that many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided numerous local kolorite by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal reasons, he mentioned his work in the field of audit as a young member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it was not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in the Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005, a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left some news about the court.
"According to the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to find them in a fresh way, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW used three methods to investigate stories in an investigative way: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumours about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
At the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls when they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, the former head-of-the-office of Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis said that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he had himself been lived to the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks are opposed to having sworn with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
The French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972, in protest against the proposed government tax.
A conciliation meeting will end without result.
In the conflict about the tax on the rich, the government and the professional football in France have moved to a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande, although on Thursday in the Paris Élysée Palace, received association and association representatives and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be completed, the Chief of the Profiklubs Association (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore not possible.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council.
The flood, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, had been an inciting event that raised the question of protection for the future, said Häßler.
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal," said Häßler.
The planning of protection against a high-water expected every 100 years, according to the German weather service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima."
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009, were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, Gechingen has to invest around four million euros, with the municipality expecting regional subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Mr Häßler pointed out that there was only the support if an overall approach was implemented.
In this respect, the community was dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A comprehensive planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stamheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to make their concerns known.
Among other things, it was called into question why no more dams and restraint tanks were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, a specialist of the responsible engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed the need for the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution was to find, according to Joachim Wald of Forest and Corbe.
In the old town, there was a lot of displeasure, which, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, had to suffer again and again from the overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, Mr Häßler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems were different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regenerative events could be handled.
If the water channels were to be larger, millions would be swallowed up.
Serious injuries after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on the national road 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much to the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so hard to hold that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was at first unexplained.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The line was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostojevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Diving the kinship in the outside: the stabbing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojevski, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite a thing in his own country.
Some of the titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security and the faith to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs on his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoek and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime," that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like our terrifying, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the chief of the authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, for which we have a criminal criminal, full of pesudo criminals." They read time flows.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drones philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the guard himself will be monitored and a future crime will be carried over.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only does it take error and sacrifice into account, but it builds on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Scarecrow to testify to Merkel in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Scarecrow about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the Interfax Agency reported.
Before that, the Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Stöbels had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance scenes and the action led to a change of heart between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US did not use any opportunities for foreign espionage to "steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former member of the Whistleblower, started publishing his cover of American surveillance secrets, European governments and heads of business are no longer sure whether they can take the Director on the floor.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new level because of state surveillance.
The barrel to overrun led the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was endured, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can reach the target, then it is certain that management is also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US was now almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey, which was published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, in the documents that Snowden has been leaking through, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU did not have certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen it slowly...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the range and technical refinement of the US spy-hearing companies, which were exposed by the Snowden revelations, have shocked the company that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of the non-US-based members' plans to use an American provider were rejected.
Jim Snabe, SAP's Deputy Managing Director, says: "We see a new question from customers that were not there a year ago - it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this legal area?"
Many German company leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company does not normally boast of the counter-measures that have been taken, because that gives the attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been flattened that taking a free USB stick at a fair or leaving a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as a hearing device.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away after.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," the BAT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, in the US National Intelligence Estimate, France, Russia and Israel were ranked behind China as two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.

A trend: The retro-look has been moving back in.
This is about to start with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The clothes are closed in front of them, often with a veil, but in the back they go down their back and often end up in a tug.
However, the spirits are separated, as Stefanie Koch stresses from the fashion house of Kleimmüller.
In gentlemen, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but also cream-coloured or brown combinations can be chosen.
It was important to select the place, was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remiss.

"But they are also popular for young people's parties," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, recording series in special places, preferably for waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful in a rally-Obeitce tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to number 12 with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, presented himself to the critical views of the power judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a standing mat that stood behind the stand in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old doubts it.
"You are convinced that your son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never thought he'd died the way the sheriff did.
"They believe that it is not logical to violate the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth would be hidden to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he commented.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in any direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy meant that Johnson had died from the consequences of a "position-related suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, had given rise to another cause of death, said Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would charge the FBI with carrying out the investigation.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in the South of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video records contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish guidelines for the allergy of schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued, as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teacher and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The laws in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair on it" or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with unclear genitals.
Neonates are no longer assigned to a rigid male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can state "indeterminate" or "not determined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for sexual allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year either as a boy or as a girl.
They are one of the intersexual, a group that is subject to the diagnosis of "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most of the US experts suggest that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if at all, one decides to do an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret that makes people gay.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 says that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related but due to their biological constitution, which is not only male or female, but which is typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hardening, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons are exposed to in occupational life and of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not in line with the gender picture, boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "gender-free" person, after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the basis of which: "If the world is dragged into a new state where the sex is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were given a sex at birth.
"Being a parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex parts were called hermaphrodite, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they are assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called the one" psychiatric emergency, "" said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with non-clear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who felt that the gender was formable.
He shaped the term "gender identity" and argued, social and environmental attacks - as parents raise a child - interact with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered himself a male or a female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John / Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child in a pounded circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public who are "not happy with the result."
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
= = References = = = = External links = =
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should have a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for the fact that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the manager of the California-based legal group of lawyers for informed choice, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatizing."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to" assign "to the child, she said.
We fear that will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognised as the third generation."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force little children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a brother-in-law from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "powerful" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
She is now married to Katie 29; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the children's psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make decisions in a rush," said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and thus gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way everything is all right - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an overhasty operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the gender that is better suited to him - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shot from car
Unknown people have hurt a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in a car shooting.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air-pressure weapon.
That's what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was easily injured by the left calf.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had stopped all of a sudden.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The crime police are investigating, they were called on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to work children who threw them against house facades.
As the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the remains of the ovaries in the same way, no material damage is likely to have been caused.
In addition, some Sylvester boulders were probably fired in the city area, but there was no material damage.
A resident in the bishop-friend-way reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel-side blinds were removed.
However, until the arrival of the police, the man found all his wheel-side blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders," Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be overcome at the age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to learn in their own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book from her has been published on the subject of "Happy Living in the Old Age - Which form of living is the best for me?."
"Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at the age," she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who are even dealing with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them are going to put it away as long as they can.
The other people are always getting old, "she says.
It's only when the pressure of suffering is really great that you think about it.
"Then it can be too late," said Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-defined living in the old age.
'But what housing is chosen is always an individual decision ', she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who could afford the retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book gives to consider those who want to leave the country.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
In the old age, everyone has their ticks and macks
"For me, a community like that would be nothing," she says, with a wink of eyes.
It's not like a student wG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age, you just need your retreat rooms," says Ries.
However, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior residential community can still work.
This had to be done differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want to rest, 'she thinks.
With this opinion, at least in the capital, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it is possible 'is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Your service advises people about the topic of "getting older."
This is why older people would often also buy inconvenience and restrictions only to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation's product test.
There are many possibilities today to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-specific conversion of their home or apartment should first be informed and not be responsible for the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-specific conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect explains.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment in an age-friendly way, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
While one could install a stairway within the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the living door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it greets her more than in front of the spider at her living door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was still accused of having passed on unallowed secret information.
So he had to file a criminal case in the United States, said the speaker of the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that either.
Before that, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbels had called on the USA, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the statements of a member of the parliament were that of a German member of the government, and not that of a German member of the government.
The secret service unveiler Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to be clear about his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbels on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, Bundestag and Federal Attorney General.
The text of the letter is as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously a contractual or direct agent at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my home country.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and high officials, including the United States, have assessed the revelations to a system of comprehensive monitoring, which is not accountable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks taken into account have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breach of faith and is seeking to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this negative position.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible information of the facts on the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person.
The local council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," stresses Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to rise for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, look for the garden and clear the way.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Square concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach offers a space concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the bar at 7: 30, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammricher musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, presented the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully overcome the first music shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the book that will appear soon, and on Thursday night she reported that the President's top consultants had conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if it would look better for Obama's swinging hope of re-election if he dropped bides.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book is a thorough review of the history of the efforts of the campaign's and the White House's leading staff, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton with the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly hidden secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House's senior advisor, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley had been at the top of the efforts to exchange bides despite their "close, personal relationship" before it was finally decided to oppose such a move, after the data showed that the candidacy of Clinton "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
You have to remember that the President had terrible polls back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley called the investigations "required care," Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay off in terms of the electoral urns.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political probations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the investigations on whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
I mean, e-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service use e-mail as well as the traditional mail, in a technical way, to implement the letter secret?
In the design of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account to create a stable basis for a hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni," are the computers of the two directly connected?
The Anna e-mail program or browser will send the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read through the network on their way?
Most of the emails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail is an attachment to a malicious program.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading a mail is very low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails.
This will include possible illegal deforestation actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With a high technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly private mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail from Google was able to add clearly.
Mother in the forest is barred and pension is collected
When his besieged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care.
In order to continue to collect pension and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he took the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noticed that no more medicines were needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally gave birth to his mother.
According to the police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Would you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining lesion.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to make the luminous protein artificial.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, increasing the pH in the protein and causing the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights up - the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice lights.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to put it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about £140.
But it tastes good for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible, in itself, because of the light-breaking caused by the ice crystals of which ice cream is made; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the Handball Association League without any point after six days.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow, there will be a derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season will start again for us.
"I hope that we will finally have our heads off," is Ehler's behaviour optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete cadre at his disposal.
Daverden, as we do, also relies on a tempo game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left anything but a safe impression.
After the first season victory against Nordhorn, Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed.
The game was, of course, a home number.
But that's why we're far from the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to go to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte becomes Jodat.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windssuß, who is active with the A-Youth-Bundesligiist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I will not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the last cry is of the most exhilarating inanimating objects.
Women no longer have to hide in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not cinnamon.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on this, says The Nielsen Company.
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lussels, chocolates and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who are going through the neighborhood with the word "sweet or sour."
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let's not pretend - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery producers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more part of Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which achieve $500 million in revenue, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're on to leave a comment like "nice face expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the cutting of a pumpkin lantern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree - something that we made from small to small.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to cut the pumpkin and not sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rotates in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathesdon in Napa, California and cut something nice out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces in the mountains
The fire brigade had to equip in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire the night to Friday.
The rescue forces are keeping a cowardly body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmholtz, rescue forces found a body in a three-family house.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued to explain.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has started an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible lack of a parish: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the State of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day course itself.
With Burfien, the Landskirche for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and less young people choose to study theology after their graduation.
Burfien brings this back to the process of de-church: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can place my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastoral carers.
They made as much as teachers and could live well.
I am sure that more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This meets the young people of today, who are not just about career, but about a full-bodied work.
According to the Landskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariats.
In thin-populated peripheral areas, such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a wide range of training.
You can even become the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-call system.
The options range from increased brakes, a service package with support for bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as a possible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the punishments and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a hiker in the quarry in her nauseous position
Firemen severed to the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire department managed to get a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of which the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flapit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately looking for her missing dog and published a call for help in social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2: 15 on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Clickheaton Fire Station hurried to the ground and severed to save Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was like a stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She ate a couple of dog cakes after that.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said, "Ruby had a great luck."
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet, but he did not find anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in the arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that "he attacked me when I was 18."
She added, "This was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to reach Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" ended up in place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new story of terror about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a line secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not, as expected, play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often turn their rules in a strict way if it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it already looks like a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to join Europe after the war has been put to a halt.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground who are hostile to the EU or want to overthrow the euro as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to take the alternative for Germany - founded only this year - for almost five million votes in the September Bundestag election, effectively expel the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is turning out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket, which forces the national economy to hold on to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and that is what German politicians want to do.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budget and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives adopted by Brussels - a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry is paying double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a disgraceful cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Granmouth.
All wage requirements in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in control and to raise Paris to the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which is what the French economy is fighting for.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy front national has just won a decisive re-election, and so the ruling socialists have referred to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope that it will get to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also includes saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could do well in a more relaxed European association, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries that have similar ideas is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib The Coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, just to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white counterparts, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair are already growing at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatric Children's Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and constituted a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming up parents - usually this is no sign that puberty is now rapidly coming in," said Kaplowitz.
Obviously the development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body smell, shows up in girls earlier.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to get to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is progressing.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "premature" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age of eight.
In most cases the process is slowing down or stagnating - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another episode: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant in terms of drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their old-age geniuses."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys get into puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which established a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Global, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow the facial and pubic hair before, the trend towards a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even common among babies and small children.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seating width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-range flights, which indicates the sound of a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the width of the seat offered to passengers in the tourist class for long flights - not always the ones for which airlines are most concerned, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft and expect record air travel at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are nine or ten-seat rows - is crucial for the economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" includes 406 people in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 promotes 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often give a high level of information about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, and money-makers showed a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus sales head John Leahy.
People are getting thicker in the face of changed eating habits, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average sameric between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
According to US health statistics, the size of the male average samerican in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival is in line with a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies were carried out which claimed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus to the seating levels and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations the experience in the plane depends on more than the seating width.
"It is really a question of giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful," explains the air cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, the issue is more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales.
The fight is followed by a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight for the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boein to the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in unit costs is still lower than for machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose the closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inch seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-wide jet sellers even carry tape measurements to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat series, but according to its own statement no one has yet sold.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to puke, but could be derived from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, further tests are needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infected the liver cells, which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
In contrast, mice without vaccination would have taken a "out time," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
Early tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the level of antibodies.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if he is very sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"They know: when they start smoking again, they no longer enjoy the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to take off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Minister of the New South Wales Laboratory Party, Joe Tripodi, is under investigation by the State Corruption Supervision.
The former NSW Minister denies having changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land areas on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various State Ministers to extend the lease at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is established for the accusation that Tripodi had known of Obeid's hidden interest in the land, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, had declared on Thursday accordingly.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which paid the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of public procurement.
But he refused to have made the changes to the requests of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a redesign of the government's lease arrangements.
One of the telephone records presented to the ICAC showed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry, in August and September 2007, after working under Obeid in the fishing authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone talks the preparation of the commercial lease arrangements?," asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," said Tripodi.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli combat aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to "authenticity test"
The government is thinking about a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visas in the context of extended measures.
If the test was introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be regarded as insulting by the neighbours of Australia.
"A loud explanation of how foreigners should be in the back" and "to set up Australians first" are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market, "she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some of them in the region have an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal covers 12 measures, which were once considered by the former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was here yesterday for talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether "the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after having in the past hired hundreds of companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-lank asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island.
The nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been taken care of by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary, Alistair Carmichael, commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "make it clear" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British Ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, see or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode."
During the most part of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to which the US airlines have to implement a large amount of work, but do not follow any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA also stated that the announcement will be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," was published.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about the extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system to flights and says that it is open to change, but it should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas said that you will remain with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used in the start-up and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio problems of mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training.
"After a company has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all levels," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Reviderby against Schalke, fellow BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first of all.
It was an unusual, almost spenastic acoustics that offered to the viewer until shortly before the annexation of the Bundesligas game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans with their songs were mostly to be heard.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, first presented themselves exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The port of the Capo, which otherwise co-ordinates the joint lighting, remained unmanned.
And at the very front of the gallery, a big flag with the inscription "Section Stadion Prohibition."
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term cheers.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and sore scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing was going on.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again included the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make for a celebration.
Only five minutes before the turn-on, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that was to the point was just to be found with his hands in a loud cry, when, as usual, the mood on the ranks of the stadium was in question.
The last one was the South Tribune, as always - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again as usual.
And at the latest, when Anpfiff of the South Tribune came up with the loud call "Derby winner stands up," everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
In front of the Reviderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB-trailers had light rockets in the audience and fired to the square - and almost the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller met.
The game was pasted late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you think it's the words of Watzke, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans' representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke denied the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnic.
In addition, various ways of punishment were shown to the Ultras - by Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a penalty by the end of next week.
"This is going to be inciting," Watzke assured.
You can be excited about how the reactions to the South Tribune are then lost.
Booming pawnhouses in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn house in the Bendemee shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is exchanging a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although every month she makes 3,000 Singapore dollars (about EUR 1,730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, she explains that the monthly family income is not enough.
In fact, demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the debt of households is increasing - is so great that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third pawn house listed on the Singapurian stock exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawn houses in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, the advantage is that there is no need for a review of the creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are possible more quickly than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnhouses, after families feel the pressure from increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loosening fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium-income households are looking for pawnings to compensate for the difference in the stinking economy.
This week, the rating agency identified Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency considers that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economic operators are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in the face of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
In the last two years, the historical high levels of gold prices have increased the trend towards the pavement of personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pawn items are gold in the 200 pawn houses of the city state.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Großmutter's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in its sales in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the Singapore stock exchange.
While some lenders had come into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yes explains that pawnhouses not only offered more favourable interest rates than other lenders but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers claim items that they already own and the liquefied personal items do not increase the budgetary debt," she explains.
The pawnings business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnings are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax stores to connect gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come to us from every social shift.
"These include well-being who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA is sucking data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service explorer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clear the ever-increasing NSA scout.
After the presentation of the Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would testify to a German prosecutor's office or to an investigation committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, said the ARD magazine "Panorama."
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions that are linked to the rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultation with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package which we believe is the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for grey star, are to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that the hospital staff concerned have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would only be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable path."
Despite this, he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a great contribution to taking the state's public health system from the care list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "patch solution."
"We are in the position today because the government of the laboratory has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is putting 300 million in it and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package was spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux 'adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the grieving story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebelled, she was confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and became the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never goes off in a ludicrous or sensational spirit - and that's where its problem lies.
The festive seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tormented bow shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and gas ammunition, the global chemical weapons surveillance group declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances were supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on which the
1 November, which the Damascus organization established in The Hague had set to destroy all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make "inoperable," including all the machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all the chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when the fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group, which is following the number of dead on a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of the dead in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country.
Assay's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details were given.
The fighting underlines the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are at, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a dead civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two facilities because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned" according to the Syrian statement, and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program had been transferred to other mentioned facilities that were inspected. "
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw the hat before the bravery and the courage that you have all shown in the performance of the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and their security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdulrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger on judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 in Bali during the bombing, were angry at the verdict of the last of the instigators who were brought to justice, because they believe that Umar Papek should be shot by law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A number of terrorist charges also took place, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also called the "Demolition Man."
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation of Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a shooting squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made the same as the ground, when on 12 October 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the night club just after 11: 00.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a backpack filled with explosives explode.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while he was hanging on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamia - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be in court.
In January 2011, he was arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't turn himself in," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held in Bali and Australia with commemorative celebrations.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the image of films, but not by phone, so the new guidelines, which were published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline, FAA staff said Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the rules for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in an announcement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start it again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must turn them off again and must not start again until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA stated.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional flight crew members, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented - and we are working closely with the airline in this respect - both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are, to be honest, tired of having to feel like carers on this issue.
However, Internet connections for the surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the airway.
And more heavy devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight will continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may repeal ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board said security experts on CBS News, that mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could cause potential interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies it is said that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication equipment by VHF radios carried by passengers, which at that time were the latest technical trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for a few years when the flight height is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give off much less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only give off minimum radiation when you turn over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but none were able to find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he considered the device interference to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports of pilots who spoke for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the switch-off of the equipment by the passengers in the event of an instrument landing under bad visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rereleased by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island
A bird fled by air to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was again released into nature.
The water rump was flown to Aberdeen last month, where it was paused by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, "This water rump was probably a winter migratory from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could not continue to fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When they were released, the water rust was back to fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 leaders from the economy, representing, for example, the UK's size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be preferred by the government, rather than being involved in the long and exhausting process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions.
In her view, the majority of economic leaders consider that the control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, as the companies said that the costs of the Brussels rules would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone - even 40% of the large companies agreed with the ones that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that is probably the most important thing to say, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pressing for a "meaningful change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
It is a matter of much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation to significantly shift power back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows what a greater focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has started," said the chairman of the board of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, will create an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "permanently" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other neighbouring countries should start on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, what German commercial real estate is looking for is a look at the volume of transactions.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's period.
In the United Kingdom, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences in connection with children before charges were brought in 2011 against the child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for Child Sexual Abuse.
But in the opening declaration to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "there was never a sexual abuse incident in the organisation."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another, in which one of the sports teachers of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of the abuse of his entrusted children.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assisting lawyers, that he knew about the first case, but that he did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
However, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had "failed to go down from me" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report infringements of the child safety directives.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA in the beginning of the year for sexual crimes against twelve boys during his two-year activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, treated them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the chief of the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible."
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have been able to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, her friendship with Lord has affected her judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not the reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to press the staff to sign the confidentiality obligations shortly after the charges were made was made by the Managing Director of the children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was necessary to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a child-safe organisation during the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, integration, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided speaking on British policy, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in a crowd in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knerps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee took a loose step through the three rounds and took the first prize - leaving 30 grown-up opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of them the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons he had put his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then he has been practicing every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great group."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and went off the square with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had taken part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
A total of strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howell said, "The whole audience was like electrified, and all of them fired him and clapped him."
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way it started, it won't take long for him to be on the "horse of the year" look - and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A spokesman of the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee as well as how well they would have beaten themselves and presented themselves in the show ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothes contributed her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be "reformed" after the call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter on the front page, who had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fake reports about a national company.
The New Express is now subject to "comprehensive reactivation," the regulatory authority said.
The "Rectification Unorder" was received by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his report license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group had been instructed to make a full reactivation of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant controllers at the New Express and to immediately review the New Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it in the first place because I was looking for money and glory.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that it was not possible to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made statements on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely enforced, despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for the drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters of the tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzak pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities explained.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men, who, according to the authorities, worked as a driver, were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cartels to bring their product quickly to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a just under 640 meters long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
An actor, Orlando Bloom, has spoken out for the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Curic, who was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexica, the vegan is subject to vegetarism, but it is different from this in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians allow for the consumption of cream, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these faggot are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan leaves away from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may ask, but with a closer look, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread covers are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegan.
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
In the first place, vegan is an ethics.
"I do not want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the maximum of the vegan that extends to all consumption behaviour.
Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not a renunciation, it is not an asceticism, but an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options with the dietary change, Proctor is more likely to refer to the power of habit.
And just these conditions also failed some still so well-meant attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very important factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn to it: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste very good.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not only to reduce to animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to food disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
"My blood levels are fine, I often get checked," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are fed with feed, rather than grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the coolant, the vitamin B12 content is high," says Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
Proctor should not go wide-ranging ways for food procurement.
After all, there are basic food everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people miss that only the finished products are expensive, but this is how it is, as we know, the" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes was much more favourable and less time-consuming than was generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small kneffen you can achieve good, if not in part better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carboxylic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his mother-in-law.
The vegan gives a new spice to family festivals.
This has a dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been given skepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to be an enclave.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as it should be - and the vegan does not seem as limited in everyday life as it is generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many Döner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he evokes on pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, everything a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to get on with it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough questions, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Kombuse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfreie.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"However, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then Veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when one learns to understand that even in peanuts can contain animal additives as colorants, one quickly seems to leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only is that why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food and also in cleaning.
"You gradually develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to" It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or to stumble, "says Proctor.
The veganism, it is an important moral finger-tone that strikes the consciousness.
He may not be able to get away with his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger gaps in the stock market operator.
Only on Tuesday did the Nasdaq indices not be calculated for one hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were two flaws in one week alone.
First, the US Investment Bank had sent Goldman Sachs to the option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the US came to an end for several hours because of a computer break on the Nasdaq stock market.
In addition, last year, the start of the Facebook stock market had provided a great deal of attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flow of purchase and sales orders, later established the SEC market surveillance and dwindled the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler moves 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, around 10: 00, was on the left-hand way from the station to the market.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly came on the way from a local, the biker was not able to stop in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and a about 15 cm long plate wound was drawn to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police give Assange a extradition order
The British police today issued a extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "call to stand up," which called on him to appear in a police station, and added if he did not comply, he threatened to be arrested.
Assange is in danger of being delivered to Sweden for the charges in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, on 19 June he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "sent a request to a 40-year-old man to stand by a police guard at a time we chose," said a speaker.
He's still violating the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after he has published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver, who was grated with 210 km / h and hot drink between the legs, receives £1,000 penalty
A car driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had been driven between his legs with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester district court, Howie was guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving.
Howie was also sentenced to pay the costs of £90 and a sacrifice supplement of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the income from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in the 2012 / 13 tax year was 708 million pounds, the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to say that high-quality real estate is too low, despite the effects of the old community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant in terms of the purchase of real estate in London, or stop owners from selling it," he added.
First-class properties - the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price - in the wealthy London South-West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have estimated the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market," on which the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a study of Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's wintering is connected with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs waved with the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side swallowing of their species, the researchers monitor the animals while these films were watching other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged people and analysed the behaviour.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an otherwise unexpressive dog move the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog who wanders), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience which movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the weaving with the tail is connected in a direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side produces a more friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, it was said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his tail" turns to the left and not to the right, rather than to become restless - just the other way round than in the Italian study. "
According to his statement, the differences could therefore arise that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
But since their behavior can be recorded simply, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turner
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has had throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was to play in the Hydro on Friday.
However, because of the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"At Alex Turner, a larynx was diagnosed, which is why he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved in the Hydro in Glasgow to November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticketholders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis was called for the first time on February 22, the new Cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a Cardinal who has reached an age of 80 cannot take part in the Pope's election - this is the case of a group of 120 "eligible cardinals."
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, which was also known as a Consistorium.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistorium in February, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He stated that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible cardinals was 120 again, and as many cardinals as he would like.
The consistency of the next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, said Valero.
At present there is a certain overlap between Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinals Council, founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "well possible" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis "is full of surprises - so we don't know who he's appointed."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat rest
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverad and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with built-in 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resisting the front seat rest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"If the vehicle is on the back of the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the occupants properly, so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recall models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks started in June and is the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverad and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado- and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made some commendable efforts that have been distraught by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book right now.
It's a book that I thought would cheer me up during the deceptive second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and the memoirs of Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient records in the evening and I go to bed, the book will lead me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and the news speaker stopped to see the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening as if you are being torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affandable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactics have taken too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my efforts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is possible to allow the listening of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished that reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and expenditure limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which says that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon government."
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affandable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the work of the government could contradict the political campaigns before it.
Obviously, the office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are the public debate.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unspoilt alternative, he did not seem to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard of for so long.
But with the reduction of Obama's approval values to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so much harder by this book.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have broken up in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania pre-election.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are becoming pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnat, who is in a court dispute about the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether to remove or reduce the CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission, with 53 votes in favour, officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote-making process to take place more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, choose it immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot cards.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to be able to match pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about the service to the public.
"We are not seeking any reward except that of history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global public investigation of the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly increasing.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the investigation in the world's largest financial market, where the owner is changing $5.3 billion a day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal is about the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation on this subject continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now to have been given leave by his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was left on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, who said the situation was close to people.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that it was investigating the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks go through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset the traders in an area that has in recent years been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies has reduced the chances for speculators.
Some bankers tried to play down the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks lead "to an impact on the market at very low ticket prices."
The message came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that this week she was quitting a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and co-operates with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and spread the footpath, it is said in a press release.
The planned cover of the broken house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site is threatening to move away.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" was attached.
This, however, did not disturb the 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins."
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the huge project should one day fail.
In a conversation with many passers in front of the "construction site," it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the implementation of the city's project, although not few have the same questions to the dimension of the proposed project as the BI.
But they're starting to resign, because the city is continuing to delay these answers, it's called the BI side.
As can be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the out for the thermal bath, if the people were to vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem to be very scared, and others feel they are "a plump attempt to extort the population," the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shelt for Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so the sports director of the "cops" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow King," he took the two Offensivwirgers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became an alleged act - which was, of course, not one, as the TV pictures showed.
"A huge mistake," Rangnick said, the referee called Harkam "completely overhauled."
In addition, Harkam would have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have been the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the chisel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
In the light of the success of the race, however, Rangnick agreed to a praise.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to do.
In particular, the way the team plays is impressive.
I want it to go on like this.
There will be hardly any change in the framework in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick made it clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affandable Care Act - it forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The top judge John Roberts was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alto and Kennedy decided on the other hand.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health Act that states should either extend the access conditions for medicaid or otherwise all state medicaid funding would be deleted was not unconstitutional.
The action against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself with huge mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their darkest valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!," said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some of the people in the valley worked on sunchairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, sunhungry people had to drive a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays to the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been available for some years to the Italian Alpine village of Viganella in the winter.
Post hardly learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but you can read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 are emptied in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The FDP's social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up on this.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially at the terminal post office.
"In spite of the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this company is in a radical and unreasonable state of mind."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberal Group and the City of the European Union, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptiness times are being changed or deleted in a clandestine way."
The post office is a long way from close to the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisolo.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, a letter box with Sunday emptying should also be able to reach on foot.
In the city hall, Rohrenbeck asked whether the city administration was planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, was also a Sunday emptiness in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
This morning, the city's magistrate will discuss a presentation of the transport deteur Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the parking fees are to be increased by 50%.
For this, however, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and parking machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council has to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea."
The possibility of parking directly before the business was "an ununderestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The German Transport Club considers that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and, in fact, long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions to overrule hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Elders were standing on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it was shown that they were unable to fully cope with the rapid actions of the joyous cities.
With the hard and placed hits the gönningen were extremely difficult.
They again missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the centre of the network and were not there in the block defense.
Two high first record wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joyous cities in all matters.
In the light of this pressing and game-determining performance, the third set was then won a bit of a soft and lustless 3-0-final (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make it clear in Nawold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannnik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposite in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-to-fight two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in the case of the ball acceptance; even in the case of the passes, the precision was sometimes a lack of goods and in some critical game scenes the overzealous prevented the view for possible point gains.
In this very well-balanced meeting, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto was consistent with the great physical commitment and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view to the valley should be cut off in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the gloss of the shovel, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time, the tourist aspect could also be taken into account in the environmental field.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribucait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Prize of Freiburg following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribucait, the tourist goal of the long-term view is to maintain the now highly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Some species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections to maintain the soil.
Tribucait said she would not fail to break a lance at this point for the planned biosphere.
The current measure was not only seamlessly integrated into this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the achievements of the life project as well as the previous days of care for the future.
After these various statements, the district leader Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in advance, the forest trawler would be available for call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of jars and the maintenance of a drystone bar.
The aim was the free view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Kopfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstätje Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own city works can be referred to as an attractive city, no second candidate for the mayor has yet come forward.
The only candidate for the follow-up to the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age, has so far been the 46-year-old bank manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application period will expire on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, seized an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overthrown by him during the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is in the joint possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concerned technology that conforms search terms on the Internet to relevant advertising, so the lawsuit, which thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overbowed by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the patent in the auction, Google has violated and continues to do so," he said.
Rockstar demands a high level of compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is deliberate, according to the accusation.
Egypt honors first freely elected presidents
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn as the first freely elected President of the country, and so the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, who had his seat on the Nile, and was inspired by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which had been most of the time taken into account by the respective government as a prohibited organization since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11: 00 local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential prunk from the Mubarak period, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usually animated road that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wood-shaped chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in a position of contempt.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest hearing room of the university with chorus of "The army and the people are one hand."
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high-rise of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath to the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led last year to the end of the authoritarian reign of Mubarak, and he called for the withdrawal of the presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of state that was being chased out of office.
But with the official oath to the court and not to the Parliament as usual, it boils down to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Disco "Blue Velvet" has started.
On Friday night it is called "Pump this party," on Saturday night it goes on with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell by ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was severely injured.
The man from Lamperechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside of a guest house.
When he went up on the ladder that was drawn to the roof, it slid away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the "Christophorus 6" rescue helicopter.
Rape in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim had later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused a country-wide horror.
The 21-year-old had raped Arene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar with Booysen during the trial.
He also confessed to having beaten her and raped her, but he denied to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had first started with several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes in South Africa are almost part of everyday life: there are about 64 000 ads every year for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has much more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
The police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the dark numbers in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pig's owls, and turboload is not a good condition.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
He only comes inside the factory with hair protection and a stick.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can get to the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening in fast food in Waldshut
"This is where I am working on huge quantities," the television makers, black-skinned ham, are surprised as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what the quality is.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the disassembly of the cousins is still a hand-work.
Because: Black-skinned ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Tannenzweige here in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test-waste.
"It's really good," says the TV star.
This will allow all those involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from tourists in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current targets are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well in the direction of record-year income before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our most powerful producers of results.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which equates a slightly weaker market for business travel.
In the same way it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while here too the business customers spent less.
The US business recovered from the first half of the season, with a result that a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to treat at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The test also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for audits, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new benefit system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would become "challenging, ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that in English schools there is less time spent on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum, it is said that the comprehensive examination of mathematics - combined with a greater weight of the subject in rankings - would probably encourage schools to start more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is paid to "problems of the right life," including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbit of different races and colour strikes presents the circular association performance show this weekend in the mayor's house.
The reviews were already carried out on Thursday
The local association W514 is again holding this large exhibition.
The breeders of the Soest-based associations show their best animals as well as young Wickeder Hobbyhalter their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges made the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to draw outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3: 30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola, which is well-stocked, and to a delicious cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson is separated from her legendary blond curls and for the first time appears with a new bubihead.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous for their role in the Baywatch television series.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a dramatic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated itself from its long blonde curls in favour of a platinum-blond short hair cut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look on Wednesday in Los Angeles and also put a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the moral change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To hell with hell - Theological considerations about today's handling of the last things."
= = References = = = = External links = =
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical communities of Salem, Salem Castle and the Kulturamtes Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question in the forum of how people now classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had placed it on those images of heaven and hell that "still shape our ideas" so far, the contemporary prophetic doctrine is characterized by the hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of speech.
"The greater hope has been driven out by the religious criticism of Christians," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation signs seem to have come to our hands."
Johanna Rahner continues to say, "But the crucial challenge remains the inconvenience of death."
The question of that desire, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated from the University of Freiburg in 1997.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg affirm their commitment to faith in the firmation
In two divine services 101 15 and 16 year old young people of the pastoral unit Am Kleine Heuberg have been protected.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the company, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, the Firmlingen had prepared for the great feast under the direction of Diacon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community level and together experienced the Youth Day in Lower power.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastically participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel of the leading sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous everyone's wheelers who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class junior drivers were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation for good positions at the German championships.
These two could, as expected, set off from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
At the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare, who made it to the top of the victory.
In place two and three, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to stand down from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional of the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was already twice the world champion in 12-hour driving together with a team member.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With it also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German champions in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude there was a final of the Wimpernschlag in the finish in front of the three-lake hall.

Only a second behind it the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were the third of the overall score.
In the women's evaluation, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binschwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organised course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
You can vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to be the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father constantly losing consciousness and travelling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00 in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most of the comrades could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditure are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his countrymen suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and drive on the roof through unfortified terrain to the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave - with its wide smile and its limitless energy - is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per drive," said Bwelle.
They come from a 60 km radius around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is necessary for the school but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the city hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They are drumming all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will then return to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
A man said that the free operation of a lizard that he had received now allowed him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, said Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's going to sleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and is a volunteer in Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we help to tap blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated health material.
However, if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instructions.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no limits.
For bwelle, the almost permanent work is not a burden.
To help others to live a happier life and thus to fulfill a promise he has given to his father, makes him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent master of the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea," is Horst Janson cut to the body.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, the art of acting.
No one can tell the old man Santiago anything in the fishing.
That's how the two of them just complement each other great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, which the fishing boy Manolo is talking about.
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson has excellent master.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and will.
Janson is on the stage in a long way as a single actor.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man acting in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he sets the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who with her songs and her magnificent voice sings the feeling of Cuba's life.
The four musicians play Kuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
On about 120 meters in length, a water canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne does not come by the cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky about 157 meters and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filicereals church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourisme directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a car-just city, and therefore the remains of the old city walls only stood that which was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park are therefore also passing by the Roman remains today and are only leaving their car.
But if you look more closely, in the park deck D2, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods.
It can be seen about five meters high ruins of hand-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants at the top of the park take a look in a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the Pretorium, and here the participants rise back down to the depth.
We are here the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, "which in good German means as much as" City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippinese, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Kaiserkulf. "
And the Pretorium is the former Palace of the Governor, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," the school will cheer the guests up.
One more surprise, Schulze.
After getting the key at the register, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, different water levels can be read in the lower end of the Mikwe, the origins of which go back to the eighth century by changing the level of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass until the completion of the project.
leg almost cut off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted death, dangerous assault and material damage against two 30-year-old people has started before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent about the opening.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then part of the bandidos.
In June 2009, the public prosecutor accused them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have been part of the competing group of Hell's angels.
One of them was a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems that a follow-up with several cars had been carried out.
According to the charges, it was about government fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after the review of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in the open court for another offence.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the crime.
As a witness, the Commissioner at that time was invited.
The main focus was on phone calls from the accused and other people the police had been listening to.
It is difficult that Rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that they honor - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said, on demand, that there have been new traces since the last trial.
The process will have 11 further days of negotiation.
The Disposable Society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it will go home.
Only: in the bellies of the people on the passenger's and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for that!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I like to be with you when it comes to getting fast food late in the night or early in the morning.
A couple of fries, a Coke, a Burger - and then nothing like home and to bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco geese are noticeable.
Because what's wrong with you throwing your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
In particular, at the weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home with respect to the next trash?
It's not just that the paper stuff is going to mess up the landscape.
Sacks have already covered transport facilities such as control boards and caused accidents.
This is what the "disposable society" thought about, but not after, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, with a lot of people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after a night of celebration: clothes, bottles and other garbage are there.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - in contrast to the street where no one wants to walk around on the food remains of others.
I see already coming the day when the cities and communities will be too stupid to walk away - and the fast food chains must demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After strong criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received a letter of notice from their insurer, the Republicans have in recent days accused the President of cheating on the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatised his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or better than predicted.
"You're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population who have themselves completed an insurance scheme had to look at another rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affandable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing in front of the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affandable Care Act, stated that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a sebelius raised to a consultant sitting behind it at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was accepted after a discussion with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly endured with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced a state-funded insurance in order to conclude a tariff for HealthCare.gov herself, which she now wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli aircraft had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
The aim had been "missiles and related equipment," of which the Israeli government had feared that they had been intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis had been held responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa-type defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles were shown, according to Channel 2, which have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Unsure The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters is quoting an also anonymous Israeli government official, saying that he believes that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah before, in part successful.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry in an unprecedented confession that the US espionage has "gone too far"
With an unexpected confession, John Kerry suggested that the US's defensive attitude to its monitoring programmes should be softened by saying that in certain cases the espionage had "gone too far."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for turning to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA's espionage activities.
Through the information that has been leaked, the US government has come into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-based speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "Without a doubt, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have heard of some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do what is still going on in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, in September 11."
He then, as the first high-level member of the US government, admitted that the US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that it had saved many lives through its surveillance.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is committed to killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have experienced such plans in the run-up to.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorism effort, as the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to the frustration about the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democrat in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I will also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concern about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the Head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden's submitted documents, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the visit of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route of travel was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the horror about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga-Auswärtspiel of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is in charge of a use by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to renounce the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she had reported to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding them.
Later, however, the video footage of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruggy League, who has turned to the State Department in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on the loose.
In the meantime, it was in the Australian reports that she is taking a vacation in the holiday resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
The court found that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the travel inspector Michelle Smith in Phuket, could try to improve its impact on the tourist image, and that is why there is an acquittal.
