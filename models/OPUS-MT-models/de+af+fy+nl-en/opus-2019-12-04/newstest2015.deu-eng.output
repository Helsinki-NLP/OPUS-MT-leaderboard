The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo since his first important foreign visit in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-old after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before he went to the Bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the driver's description were later seen at a house at the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police are accusing a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is to be published in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, sleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recreation to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, I proudly present the employee approval law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labour law law to create a possibility for workers who have been exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to complain to a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or criminal penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to connect back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have had in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries all over the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
fully aware that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the workers' rights to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every occupation or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to set up a trade union - and that this trade union could then participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - had to be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to rethink the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. 50 years ago said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a market for industry in a wonderful way and has raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and have fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five government abortion clinics.
This measure, which was brought to the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is to enter into force on the 1st of September, would force doctors who perform abortion to acquire a patient's right to receive a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote the Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
A hearing shall be held within one month for the judge to make a more permanent decision on the law.
Absence advocates welcomed the decision to take the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take more time to obtain hospital rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are avoiding a law of indecency that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for the Rights of Reproduction, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also applicable to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and also applied for the right of appeal.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures not constitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics left in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, are in agreement that the right of doctors to be sent is subject to unnecessary restrictions.
It is not the case that the measures are intended to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the right to a patient, informed the Centre for the Rights of Reproduction.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing abortions, this doctor would no longer do the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortion, while their applications for the right of the patient to information would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, who found ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovary cancer, existing pre-conditions and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the diagnostic point, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy an increase in the service of forced doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical status, and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling number of house owners
The decline, together with an increased reduction in the number of home owners under 35, could lead to the loss of ten thousand pounds per year in garden centres if today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age group for garden products."
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people spend with their own home for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting the pregardens for parking purposes and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated £5 billion will be put into sale annually.
In the London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of house owners has fallen from 61% to 43%, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade due to increasing number of house owners and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now returning to the station.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around one kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharif's resignation, but he rejected it.
The country's army is now calling for a political solution to the conflict to "waste time and apply without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been pushing more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan is accusing Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to go to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey is ordering US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's oldest US diplomat to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the business manager of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
A previous report, which was also targeted by the most important secret service of Germany Ankara, made the Turkish government much more angry.
Warning strike: drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The national warning strike of the train drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced at 18 to 21 o'clock concerned all transport companies across the country, including the distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is the traffic of goods.

said the district president of the German Locomotivführer trade union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight traffic.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Police chief charged with corruption by Magaluf
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located, following the charges of corruption.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Prosecutor for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and, together with Navarro, are questioned by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the veto economy of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen said to the court.
Let our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video, where an 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who performed on 24 men during a drinking tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholized vacationers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-impregnated kneipentouren.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage have to pay together a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for many accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of the "Balking," where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given a winter surprise to southern Australia, with strong showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21: 00, a further 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy sheaths, including a cast that started just before 8: 00 and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The rough weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30, but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to pass through.
At that time, the wind reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to go through a second landing and finally started at about 8: 40.
The flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Highest time to connect
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech control centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I'm writing this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's a thought behind it: if it wasn't for the cable, all the horns would be running around in the house in a very short time, and that would be much more retro.
Or is it the eceltronic (eceltronic)?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, says that he is simply rejecting television in principle.
Why are these considerations?
Because the Ifa's pressure on the radio tower this week is again showing us our absolute incompetence in the issues of electronics.
The layman who used to be blind to the washing machine and CD players does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out in front of him with an incredible amount of expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, you okay?
What should one talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such a quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been a matter of the most important thing that we should actually network our house.
So that the yogurt can reorder itself, so that the fire detector will tell us on holiday in the Maldives that it will burn in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were to get the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, that would require air conditioning.
But a dream will come true soon: we raise our watch, say to her, "Suck!" - and at home the vacuum butter goes off.
Crazy.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," a branch expert rages, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamguard sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven will take, but this is not useful because we are in the congestion.
We also know from the daily practice: when a new-modified device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday, after they had spent the summer in air-shelters, while rocket and mortar fires were on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area was recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, which were marked by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, was removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels a little weird to go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a truce interrupted the war last week, thousands of people of the border communities, like Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily moved to other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which was hard drawn by the Palestinian fire.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl calls into question NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared itself in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU Head of State in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig People's Journal."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had almost failed in the vote on Sunday at the five percent hurdle.
A first start to a ban on the right-wing extreme party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the New Lander Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first reception for refugees in Harburg is from all the seams.
Now the interior office has three tents of the Red Cross placed next to it.
The district politicians were only informed just before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to give citizens reservations and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the Harburg District Administration currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overfilling in the initial intake are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a split market.
The data from RP Data show that the prices of the house in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while in Melbourne it increased by 11.7%.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices on average increased by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that the beginning of the spring would now see an increase in the real estate for sale for the next few months, which would be subject to "a real test."
"Looking at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the executive director Peer Medau and tells him to pose "like a field lord."
This is not the style of the university, it is said in the communication.
In the middle of June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the inception of the university.
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong, "said Pötl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preconceptions or even decisions," but that there were "preferences."
The development of the narrow road to the castle needed for access to the castle was also less dramatic than was feared by the Medaus.
A nine-metre-wide road was, and is not, the question.
According to the current situation, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before, "explains Pötl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-owned parking areas will then only be used by university students in the future does not want to allow Pötl to apply.
There is no parking at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
According to the President of the University, the children's crib of the mountain, which is located on the grounds and would lead the way to the park deck in front of the front door, is to be "not affected."
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it's about much more than about the interests of the people of Medau, "said Pötl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the children's crib, with the development of the road would be entitled to a "lost of the few natural spots of Coburg," the reader can decide for himself. "
At the beginning of October, Pötl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city council about the development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had informed the children's crib's parents about the university's plans last week.
The entrance to the new park deck is therefore not to be carried over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but over the Medau-Berg.
This would require the narrow road to be extended to about one kilometre long two-track.
According to the high calculations of the Medus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels would be ten times more.
About 2000 vehicles a day are mentioned.
From the city's side, one did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from the handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligiist SG Flensburg-Handewitt, in particular, raised health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team, "the 2007 World Champion reported on his Facebook page.
He then retired to the international retirement with a balance of 167 games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throw-in-the-back player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is now no longer at the disposal of the new German Federal trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation with the Icelandic, who announced his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be well available in the next few years too, which requires longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
The left-handed man had to be afraid of his career after a distance infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been treated with a cortisone injection by team doctors from the German Handball Federation (DHB), which had later caused a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass a body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really managed my blood pressure.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can control my head, but I can't fool my body, "said Glandorf in the interview with the magazine" Handball Time. "
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are drawn, I am always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that, after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble about my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go a little straight.
In 2008, he won the EHF Cup and in 2010, the TBV Lemgo.
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup of the Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises around the globe have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This informed the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
In the spring, consumption alone brought the economy back to life, while investment fell.
External trade also slowed down the economic situation.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, the total GDP increase for the first half of the year is 0.8% compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "bike driver."
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this tour through the country.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various specialist magazines.
We come from The Helder and have gone overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way, "the cyclists were pleased about the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld circles.
After registration at the Vereinsheim der Schuttenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led to Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and through Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 km with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 km with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 km with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care of on the way to Haixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and the mayor's office representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Lölfing drew a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015, hopefully in good weather on August 30 or during another weekend," but the cyclists promised to come back to the country of Münster and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers insolent honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical evidence than biography, which Constantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political-proof activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper on 287 pages in "monk and warrior."
The Münchner, born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching lyrics.
And he is completely honest: from the Onanie as a gymnasium to the theft of the store and the use of drugs, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes abstract, but the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as not only did the music influence him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wacker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "created by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving away all unnecessary things."
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-mental views: for example, about strokes in a local frequency of GIs or a crazy car ride where he was in front of a tree.
There he is, too, completely honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into what life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep, stylish labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lay in the tub and then you could hear him start singing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I was walking there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, as a child, Henry grew up without the birth of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother went bad towards the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of the Irventions, and then Feces of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comodies that have filled his working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator / comedian on TV for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted" in black, Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I'm not sorry I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I was working on huge projects and I learned how to deal with a great audience.
But this "award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
The introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, in the eighties Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was on show in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.TV 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just doing the time or doing it a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him at school, and I thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othelle's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head on.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me," You have to bridge over for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This was also good, so it is like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THUNDER voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through a humorous outbreak, while he impersonates people over and over again.
I've decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you keep looking for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I do live in the Apollo sometimes, if I feel like it, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he's ever gonna take a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up on that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Hathi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Hathi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Hathis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Hushi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Hushi party "Ansar God."
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Hushi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Hushi had called on the measures on Sunday night.
According to the sheet, Hathi threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Hathis fight for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The people's tribe of the Hathi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for just two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always a bloody fight with the Yemeni army.
Kenya records officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometrically to delete "ghost workers" from government payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government communication was issued.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
A review at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or is leaving the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included, was reported in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the communication was continued.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by establishing the actual number of officials and also by adjusting the salary list at both levels of government - so the" spirit workers "are" eliminated, "said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal of the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be held in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht demand 19.4 million euros of compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies that are in insolvency proceedings.
That's what a judge told me on Monday.
In the application, it is said that Achenbach was cheating on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also have allowed the agreed commission to be higher.
Achenbach had bought value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the school service for 44 years, 23 of them as head of the school.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many established parishioners and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordbohmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
In half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
This is how the judge sent it to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
= = References = = = = External links = =
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the next train station, drive by train to Bamberg, go to school three kilometres across the city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a red-cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first state exam and in 1954, after three years, he took the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher's office for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fraulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he received a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in the school association of Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were combined in Petershausen in the present town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the present construction from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built at the municipal cost and at the 1997 enlargement of the cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," he said.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a school council's speech on justice and justice: "One must never forget love." Manfred Richter did what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "This is not always possible." Whether he means only his students or just like his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students were in a fight, they did not get a criminal job from him, nor were they drenched to be in detention.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a violets.
For the good of the school, judges had a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the paraplegic judge to run for at least the last time in 1996 on the CSU list for the municipal council.
However, the judge was elected to the sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists take part in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Mitzstopps
When cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, it's nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of the rastling people made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had taken part in Bad Vilbel by bike, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of the body and the mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the women of the country from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, pitcher, sprousel and cheese cakes, which had a wonderful mouth for the powerful cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
At the state of drink of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club, cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies of operas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already been able to fasten off the bike chains today."
In the meantime, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking house by Reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to promote the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, since the first h4 cycling tour in 2004, the promotion director Tobias Hagen was only able to get a short break, he had a lot to do with the technology on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he was communicating with his employees with three phones and a radio, and the 15-headed motorcycle team of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the accommodation capacity available.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After the arrival in Scots the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and, of course, it had prepared delicious, for example, flame cake with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly pleased about the "many plants in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open sky was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
The guests were increasingly mixed up by citizens who were just as affected by the good mood as the large group of cyclists.
On the second day, for the cyclists, the stations of Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trenches - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 km of Radelns, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reported local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they were supposed to have set up an organised criminal association and put in phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist spiritual fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slawjansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory train from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
She started her career with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., and then moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombader, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was the Executive Board of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company of Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was supposed to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory member of the council.
As early as May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust is in two directions: to the inside on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and concern when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost untenable duopol, which requires a full-scale reform.
But which new president would risk starting to beat up everything and to take apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might get himself killed.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While the competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of the licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's most important media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering tweet was not authorised
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a depressing comment on the democratic district attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account, which rejected the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it was said in the later news.
Perry's staff did not reply immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable image was drawn of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lmuhberg, who was sentenced to the tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry filed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, which led to an indictment against Perry - which might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - in front of a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet is, "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry when he splits it."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal agents requested the judge responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law that is being used against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unabated.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went into speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, in the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley again declares housing market "normal"
One of the most prominent construction companies in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to normal levels.
In June, the Bank of England, as a result of the widespread fear of a credit bubble, was very much sought after and the subject of huge price increases.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment for action."
The real estate market in London was set up during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed to the capital.
According to the information provided by the City Office, prices in the city area alone have increased by 18.5 percent in the last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers increased by about one fifth in the past year and by the end of April were around £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "villa tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which presented more stringent credit transfer arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the case of the sale of property and in the case of prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in mortgage clearance in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter every year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for the sale of the deadline amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the sales of the date have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent per year to £280 million, while the turnover increased by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley shares were fixed in London's trade at £23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nude photos of the Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and charged the hacker with "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who will post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud from Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims included the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious," however, denied that the photos were about pictures of her acting and tweeted "These so-called nude images of me are FALLSCHT, people.
Let's just stop the beginning. * Word game is intended.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letters "J."
They were disconnected, so it was best to describe it, they slowly disconnected like a box that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then shake his hand.
He knew him in a cratch.
He was stingy, like in a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this staggering was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flaming heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were delicious, in the bathrooms there were still spiders, neck chicks had left their tracks on all windows and believed that all of it belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coals.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had appeared in the service console, which provided the country with calming music and gentle news, when the sight of its crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesced, just like the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what had never been delivered and how the people in books choose the from-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing large feet in a coarse-funny serenade of Ailin.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game back then, and it was not very funny now.
He knew this was expected from him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musical expression of mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gifted - grateful as the one that was spared from fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body building, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as by nature, and were assisted by the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS-SEEDED WAR, if IT SEEDED WAR, for fear of being charged with fire, even for fear that the flames would eat them next - had opened Labor and Shisha-Pfeifen restaurants, kept in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Every man according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was hard for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be interpreted.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and hid Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her unchained black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got in trouble because he, like his father, did not have the calming charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon got red and rose from her own chair, threw the console over, and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Hollow-floral wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm wedge in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly why I'm perverted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that was shown in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from the pub to the pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or was afraid of them.
Big head?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
It was the most common word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the non-saying love ballads from the console - they first snuck and then beat.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the clutching itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the chair like an old man.
She also felt lost, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him move away from a room on the top floor, as her companion watched him do, a man complaining about something he himself had summed up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember one time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
A few years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public-mood monitoring body, worked on a brief speech on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the areas of the country in which the reduction of this violence, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of that violence.
"A lot has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to ease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt in spite of the high-ranking church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps in listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates in stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former rudeness hold the rural communities in hand, as does our urban structures, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and defiant struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I should say that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I do not ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental job.
We serve a non-prejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "devious" and "raw," could also be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural power and vitality.
If you continue to ride around what is done when it is done, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
After his head, an LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sound word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want," said Esme Nussbaum, with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effective as we are pretending to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that have only been made to THE WHAT, when it has been done.
This time, however, it is not the others that we are taking out our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions" mistakes "that our grandparents may or may not have done.
They also go too far when you talk about their "anger" and their "mistrust" of "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "others" in understanding the past and in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," dared to throw Esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we are in agreement.
And just as no debt must be assigned, no debt must be put to death if such a eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But to what is the past, if we don't learn from it -
The past is for us to forget it.
If I may say something about that,
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and let her go.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers described, had been on the road in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho denied to have planned a coup to overthrow the government and said that they were going against police accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and reported that the army of the country was surrounded by its home and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on the threat of assassination.
Military speaker Major Ntelele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup in the state, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after having received several intelligence reports, that within the police, some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup in the state," he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military reported on Sunday that the soldiers were back in their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his single government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, otherwise speaking accusations to the contrary.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, with a closely observed study.
The final market management index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced a break-in at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro area and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculation that the ECB's head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week on whether to consider a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slow-down effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for producers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Marit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a care child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
The fact that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands no longer take place is also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to boost the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, head economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in August is that the sector will continue to grow after that."
He added: "It is clear that life is currently quite difficult for producers in the euro area, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, particularly in Russia and Ukraine, are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would finally have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The tenth year of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocity in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had missed the death of the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now haunts Ukraine - and in the children like it die - is now an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the broken school gym
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov, when she was only trying to get back to the broken school gym after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were overflowing.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a number of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some grenade splits are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'm thinking about a family later.
She says that the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, as I climb back to school, I think that for the first time many people see it, understand our disaster and help to ensure that such a thing does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball-hole, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
With fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, took it by the hand, and fled through a ball-hole.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After she was reunited, she said, "I was weeping with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to get the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's getting more pale in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or we're dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car above.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and she called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now going on, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he's not looking for revenge, he's not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends in the class and they go to the gym and light candles there sometimes.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes laying on the sofa, turning the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember me pushing him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georye Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Trost: The Beslan survivor Geordu Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Geordu today
His blood-flooded face was marked by fear when he ran around his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she got off to get her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georyou could survive.
The closer this date moves, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it happened yesterday, a few scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Impressive: The image of Georye (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue.
I remember that day Geordu wanted to go to school so much, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Geordu in San Marino.
Georye does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
George says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Are we ever gonna know what caused him?
This world is becoming a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health, and I still feel it.
I had a few nightmares for about three or four years because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September comes closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and I'm visiting a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georye Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georye Faniyev was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Geordu, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georye Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is a lot more, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my records, the medical too, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Geordu won't go.
It must be a lot more powerful for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Geordu is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can walk, but he can't do any sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well, who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make for me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also about widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could get all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby, who was so gripped by a special mission in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian special mission (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty they held back their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried and has a little girl named Kristina with his new wife, Svetlana.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that go up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of running over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is in court for a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charges indicate that Mr. Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and hurt the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denounced the charge in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a watertight point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
You can also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damper underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is getting dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It is particularly important if you are working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As a consultant, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnoses and diseases, while the people treated were mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose way of suffering began.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I was having trouble picking up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient in making accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and without reason concerned.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
He had only been skiing in the French Alps two weeks ago.
The result of the X-ray was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is, the skin that overlooks the lungs.
As with most cancer, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a "miracle material" but has now been identified as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyards, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
The United Kingdom, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a Mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma only developed after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And so Mesothelioma does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are contaminated by asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber, either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was trained for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, who had been suffering from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one to be alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to get hurt?"
The leading UK expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to occur in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been affected.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A short look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often refer for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would ever affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most common asbestos found in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "major health risk" with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crokydolith) are more dangerous.
The United Kingdom was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesothelium rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore on Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelium sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma was probably caused by asbestos in the environment without a known suspension by work or in the home."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government, unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament's committee rooms, whose deadly fibres could be caused by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work needs to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to determine the exact contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he got such a fever.
He was 45, and he was doing an operation just late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the thoracic skin, the skin, was stirring around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays from his chest and started pleural catheters to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His symptoms, however, remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly and he returned to his job.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after a sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast skin.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going, "he says.
To be honest, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
All of a sudden, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended to him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who were changing from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It is shown that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It's still being removed today.
Students put their buns on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retarding properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their buns on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And then so innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shovel cloths, contain asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman had to think of was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor," how long do I have? "
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is raised and the fibres are inhaled, they can be stuck in the thoracic skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled-like asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It's invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancer do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some people think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest skin," he says.
They can't get around with the knife.
In the meantime, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advice office for those involved four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he introduced himself at calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and were expected to extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart chest specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred to, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and would have to wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are finally inevitably failing, many of the people concerned face another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally completed their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation," since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma patients who are seeking compensation to assign the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for Mesotheliom people to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million supported by the insurance industry for all those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could have promised them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelium-affected people, thinks that £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone away and mesothelium patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven victims of death, it was necessary to act quickly on a daily basis.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expected to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that makes you move on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
In March 2012, Graham Abbott submitted to the operation.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
After-care scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
It's not life-threatening.
This is life-end.
Abbott was again undergoing six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm not, for example, or show my wife how the boiler-time attitude works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You need to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease I wouldn't get old with.
They were very different.
Tamsin is very sociable and insolent.
She told her friends, and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelium disease, such talks are not through hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fire the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists started planning and mobilising it within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress in principle allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have the population elected as of 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because the people of Hong Kong have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in the hands of a close-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates are to be allowed "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing did not allow a real general right to vote.
On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement has reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they have planned for the next few weeks to protest waves.
However, they did not provide any more detailed information on this, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers reported that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as a last resort, an action to take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and more stringent security measures, including police forces and barricades, were in place on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The movement of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, as it threatened the business business - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could do great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert, Regine Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to raise any fears that Hong Kong is going out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported about the Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities, where fresmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten and McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service has a security service.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to take away their belongings in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company speaker said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, however, added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as being lifted.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and grants do not keep pace with the much increasing bills for the simplest living bases before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticise racial question and police behaviour in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and were taken into account throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women were 100% about the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "thoughts about Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people in feminism who are talking about white and who speak of privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis that we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they have to express it.
For English professor Kortha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that are exposed to black Americans every day, but which are not considered to be "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how the colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynchmurder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women fighting for women's right to vote like Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to fight for the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to fight the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steiner.
Although Steiner stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses racial and gender issues, some of her comments on the issue of race in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steiner.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police have taken up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's south-west border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration, said that for a reassessment of the issue as an essential issue for women, they only have to publish the stories of the immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the working visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a sustainability in women's organisations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the house's living room - including a pig who had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was, however, mispublished and was now removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom family house."
Although the real estate agent has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years pulled the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit would provide for talk material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a proper conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million only a few weeks before.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators were in the mud at the first Rheinbach Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far over 1000 visitors yesterday, who were defied by the rain showers and the autumn cold and were untouched by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful richness of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the times of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighting group from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis," which used every rainy break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring to the heroic two-fight in various gladiator groups.
First, the "provocators" were in the row with a rectangle shield and a short sword, as well as a leg on the left leg and a arm on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with chest shield, short sword and root flanze as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which came against the "Secutor" with the throw-net, trident and dagger, and after a short fight the boy fell to the ground.
As the swords force together in a metallic way, the shields shone, and the root flanges flew through the arena, that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman era a reality," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, was established by the amusement park in his greeting, as Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage said.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the 11-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman Canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus society once and now faced the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of the time."
This also confirms the diploma-surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineer Team Two" from Rheinbach, who introduced the instruments of surveying the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocrite, the hot air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints that Wolf and Fuchs had left in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the "Amt für Bodendenkmalbezierung" had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord department park in Rheinbach.
It was found that the walls of an economic building with a darre were used to dry cereals and to paint.
The building probably belonged to a villa of Rustica, an agricultural property, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A number of finds from these excavations she presented in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa had probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
The children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grips on the back of the day, like the Roman students.
At the stand of the Roman therms Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, to make up at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and to serve at the stand of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mill made of stone to ground the flour for a flask bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive state of the city's high school, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtenberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, which is to remind of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legion will tell about his work on the nearby Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a funny teaching hour in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
The Roman Week is intended to make the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtenberg, which are often but no longer visible at first sight.
In the Wachtberger City Hall a small presentation will remind of the find of the Berkum Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting the West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The harvest is rotted in the fields that have left the mines and the markets are waiting for - the virus has been difficult to add to the region.
Some international companies are already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
The only way to get to the market is to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, and here alone, more than 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease had gone to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, thousands of others have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
All over the resource-rich countries, companies are devoting their business.
Foreign companies, such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal, are taking off their employees, and several international airlines are no longer targeting the regions concerned.
The local traders and farmers also react: only a few merchants leave their home places to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export in the fields are rotting.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food will be close
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently to feel: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic food such as rice is disappearing.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk was that international companies would in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It was important to see how far and how long the virus would spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," says Hugon.
The disease also bursts the state's tight budgets
The disease also bursts the already tight state budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's credit rating agency is concerned that its budgets are severely offset by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Nigerian delta is not yet affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Also reservations in hotels go back clearly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schüttenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the Tannenwald Schüttenverein is preparing for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker."
On Saturday, at 6: 00, the big bully is shooting.
Then in the large festive tent is the voting evening with the "Steapfalzer Spitzbuam."
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 o'clock in the parish church and the great fortress at 2 o'clock.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the German and Gauschößen.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive dams with their Dirndlin.
It is the largest in the world.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Furacker.
The original name "Schuttengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on March 21 for "social entertainment through exercise in the use of the room and small caliber shooting."
The Nazi regime had in 1937 led to the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, who raised the "new" Schuttenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30.
Karl Mart and Adolf Ried led the club as a protector through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schüttenverein started in the "Leininger" guest house with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gaul.
The club records were used every year and the magic border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club's "Leininger" site has no longer met the demands of a modern protection association, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new protection rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauschshooting, connected with the solemn consecration of the new gun in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schüttenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A group of bulls was established in 1995.

A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllermeeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work last year, the members of the association have modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngau Hof and thus brought up to date the state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competition
The sports services of the Schüttenverein can also be seen.
A total of 11 teams are currently taking part in the round competitions: six air-gun teams, one air-gun team, one sports pistols KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was raised in the 2013 / 14 round from the Gauoberliga (the highest league in the ANB) to the district league 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as punching, fascination and king's ball, association trip and Christmas party have tradition.
With it the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race was about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire was in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do better there.
Stewart used to drive a wall in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I came up with a good result today with good hopes," said Johnston and added: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the towing and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver in an ashore race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his job, during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart has to count on a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at the 12th position, Stewart was soon after in the first 10, and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, it got bushs
Car with the number 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which went against the wall.

Fancy of the dance
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to co-strikers.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn of full-day lessons are also able to create in the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been very decimated.
Now it is increasingly sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-olds.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursday between 5: 00 and 18: 00 or on Friday between 5: 00 and 6.30: 00 in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can sneak into the training hour without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer tells.
After that, different choreographies are applied.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical, sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the sociality is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies, and we have also spent the night in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you could make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Those who are not so jazztanz can also sniff into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always snuff into the classes in the fields of children's dance / jazz dance, bambini ballet, video-clip dancing and hip-hop in the classes.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want Discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protesting across the country
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Minister for Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are continuing, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, shared with BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In the eastern Ukraine, the Prorussian fighters are still on the move.
After heavy battles, which were allegedly also involved in Russian tank battalion, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the Luhansk Rebelnelhochburg.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn human consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Proussian separatists shot off a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, according to his own presentation, the most prominent separatists have once again shot off a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents, Russian agencies were informed on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Asov Sea for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships had been under fire on Sunday near the port of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a speaker in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is now meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a separatist messenger from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up, all the actors used their steps to make their call public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was in line with the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
The NATO leader, however, accused Russia of "a huge break" of the agreement.
"Today, we must face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Russian documents and comments show that "they regard us as an adversary."
More NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Reading Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as it is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new discussions to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union was still waiting for it to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had interfered between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop the gas supply for Europe.
Europe takes about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: Maut will come "quite clear"
Now the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this.
But it's not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has been increasingly concerned by persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll.
After continuing resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"To make it quite clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not set itself on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government programme, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU) "made a proposal, and it is now being worked on."
However, the NRW-CDU remains on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also has a constructive role to play in the discussions on a draft law.
In addition to the subject, he also talked to Dobrendt about other ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband development.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is looking at its own concept to pay for highway investors with toll revenues - after the election 2017.
CSU-Chief Horst Seehofer warned against the development of toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to mute all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country president.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced that it would be possible to discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is the fear that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for coalitions due to the mass criticism of the CDU.
The left considers the plans to be failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks' toll is dead," said the party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung '(Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrendt wants to introduce a Vignet obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners are not allowed to be additionally taxed under the coalition agreement.
They should therefore receive a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not be a disadvantage for foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness, an uncertain passage and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd be in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and it took me longer.
I could never drive with the other children's skateboard or skateboard and was often hanged in school because of my way of going and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between, I'd slowly lose all my skills.
I turned it all out on my own, and I planned my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you did, or you'd be in the wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, the CMT was found.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former force practice place
For almost ten years, the former force practice site in Münsingen has not been shot.
However, every month there is still a death-taking ammo in the heart of the area of the Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the ground.
An ear-deafening bang shines in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was shot at the Münsingen troop practice site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere, which is open on 13 marked routes for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area is increasing with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such as a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third year of growth after the several years of falling in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, the study carried out by the services agency Ernst & Young with the State Taxation Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the company's real estate values, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to be also true for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in Maryland in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate tax is just over one fifth of the tax burden on companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Tax.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in company tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3% in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas, with 6 percent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes are required and a overall tax climate is better than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Company taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organised in - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes in the whole country will probably continue this year, with an increase of 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the government's spending reduction had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopping and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, used in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the officers in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the Vice Party Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the 12 million metropolis in the course of the discussion.
Guangzhou, also known as the Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD president Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, agreed to the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party's top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then arrived with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is used according to the German purity offer.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities is increasing."
At the moment, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, the capital of which is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the air connection.
The province's vice-governor, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German acquaintance, nodded with agreement.
A well-maintained partnership
The key vice party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted out of office for allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping with a harshness.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he was a top-notch in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic power.
In the next year, Li reported that it wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown her hope today that the 81-year-old comrade will recover from her disease.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a communication today.
We're all going to push our thumbs.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency in a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market from now on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1, where the buyer will be able to detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, in the category "Euro 6" more stringent nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for scaffolding: they receive a national minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion-dollar deal, and the cooperation also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," such an insider.
The switch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the (mostly older) games give a painting of secret science theaters are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Titch wanted to buy was taken a little bored, a textbook example of an established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company was reported to be willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shar, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who say that they prefer to exercise rather than watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is supposed to watch others play instead of taking control console in their own hands.
It's one thing to look at a friend over the shoulder at 3: 00 in the morning, while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a nut get shot in the head 20 times in a call of duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or human virtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Switch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are being advertised as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shar, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator's sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the strong rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
In some cases, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
For the open air in the castle garden in Salzwedel is to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already shown on the early Saturday, when the first visitors opened up to the open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they did it.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, waved with the foot in the bar, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were called.
And that across the generations.
While the one on the ceilings on the extra white sand on the beach bar, the other on a quarter of the wine in the Vinothek, the young one on the hill castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests, was raging.
But even in the making of children, the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had all the hands to do in order to master the urge and to magic imaginative creations into the small faces.
The larger ones used the kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel organized.
Until the big rain came.
Just before 5.30 p.m., he was talking about the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not do this.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular voice.
In the meantime, he said that the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who toured in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox therefore broke off their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will be left for the first time but will have to be removed for the second edition.
The organisers must also be critical of the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event side.
"You have, unfortunately, taken over a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as very close.
I think it's very good that some people are not only talking stupid, but actually trying to get something on their feet.
Hut off!, "writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now there is a year for the organisers to put off these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not the case, as expected.
The ready-to-use component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radar, is completely renewed.
The new radar will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the change of the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather is in, the action should go on stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket Challenge, Kiefer is getting lost
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge was a pain in the way.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she was stretching out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom crept so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I was screaming, and while I did that, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that was not possible, the jaw was chopped, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that too and almost got in my pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the United Kingdom was admitted to the hospital to get the jaw relocated after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to pull back on a string?
In the last place, there was always a dispute between the two Woltzhauser Burgverein.
Now the board of directors is thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Woltzhauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Woltzhauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfshausen.
The views so far seemed to be quite different, as to how to deal with the history of the Woltzhauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the association's directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we sit down," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could move back together in the future.
In this way, there were more rapid visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath were in the eye until the last reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront of the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased to hear his own information about the call.
He has been a friend of the castle since Dimbat's death.
A new chairman will be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first left the association activities out of respect." This "thought phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go to the meeting with the Burgverein.
In the meantime, the friends of the castle could also have a current mood within their group.
There is not yet a candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a tungsten house.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much to continue."
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffles in the near future.
He is the "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
By the high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they were a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive the project forward. "A" single position "for the flute town could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board." He hopes that the Burgverein may move a little on this point.
Their goal of first documenting history is "important and good."
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-two-master student Matt Schroeder considered a clever spariidea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who visits Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there were different cost-effective options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
The renting of textbooks is more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that the renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookstores in the last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores.
Here's the one-time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academists such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, also Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to give them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalties that may apply to the writing of notes, statements or traces of use.
Paid attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be visiting Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for the award of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check that the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a cash strike
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollar budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his 70 million dollar budget.
The film "Sex Tape", which was adapted to Cameron Diaz, played only 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend, while children's films like "made easy 2" also failed in the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the film itself could be the reason for this.
In 2014, Collin described "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon teeth made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, for films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average Cinemasco- and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept that and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year's turnover was 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on comics and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash-in-the-box, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall in the cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema bank at all, and no one will worry about the business any more."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis class was deleted for the tightening of the laying division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis club has an additional third Bundesliga in the program.
The result: Those who did not get up have gone down.
For example, Göttingen's highest-class team, Torpedo, has avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, but in the next season only plays five-class.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are in the new association league, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger clubs.

What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC take part.
In the district league, the regional representative Dtransfeld and the SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
With nine teams each
The SC Weende is sending his girls to the small district league.
The season of the SCW boys, where torpedo II is still starting, is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly established government association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dtransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East season, Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The women's district league consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemelen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no more women's teams at the circle level.
Noting that none of the six 2-class class target strength is reached, the innovative and redesigned circle board will have to think about it.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments for us this weekend and has spoken to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
Two young buzwankers were brought to safety with the rope wind after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW the night after.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leep in Blackheath.
They got relatives to call the police at about 8: 00 when the two had not returned home.
A search group from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 11: 00 near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had fallen and his head had hit.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The station restarted after about half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editor's office.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government to whom they are accused of electoral fraud.
The police reported that about one kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there was again a clash of about 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday night, after a meeting in the Army headquarters, for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste time and apply without violence."
The communication also said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has aroused concern for the intervention of the military, which has already been pushing more often in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since the Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to stay out on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri was similar.
Khan is accusing Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had been peaceful in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to go to Sharif's residence in the weekend.

With the 2: 0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has taken a reconcilable end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Borisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the off in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who, with green-white, came in third place.
Schrammel-Dreumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season victory has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the country's game break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, set the course for victory.
"I thought I'd cut in all the frustration of Thursday and snuck it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship meeting in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory of him.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvis-blower of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right side of the defense and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrored.
He has earned the gate, he has already provided some assistance here, "said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2: 0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests would have been able to write.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," said Schrammel, who thus played on the clash of performance and result in the last weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games you had been better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-point since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact in spite of the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
For him no less gratifying: "That we have finally played too zero again."
A lot of work during the country-playing break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have made the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The country-playing break should therefore be used to "lick wounds and make a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21-scavenger in his ranks.
One that the break is probably particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He's gonna tear himself apart for the team, get over pain.
In this very difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "said Borisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapid before his change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a little luck, but at some point the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He, of course, called for concentrated further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He was unable to deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much right now.
They are in certain stages following me, "said Hofmann.

He regretted the fast match "from the category" Magic Gate, "as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly recognized by referee colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the gate in some phases.
We didn't have enough degrees.
The interior defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It just started badly, but then we found it in and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this top there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery of the summer series "My piece of the Röner Luck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the shown specimen is the "Geissruheiche" above Unterweissenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes the buds, the basalstone heap and the basalstone seas.
A little bit below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it goes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and, with a length of over eight meters, reminds of an American mammotree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Episcopal Archives and asked older people from the University of Education to find out what concern it has with the Geißruische.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats had their animals from the well of the pasture on the weary, and they were driven away from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the keepers who were exhausted from the rise were to rest.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat flocks actually feed again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
But you should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt raised by the sun is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking path leads from the well-known to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Other paths are signposted, the way up to Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare to find in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counter-fei could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Röner Luck"?
My piece of Rhener's happiness

After weeks of diafening, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President-in-Office, Matteo Renzi, made the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy to be the successor of the British Catherine Ashton last week.
Renzi looks at how the government-related daily La Repubblica reflects, the calling of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to keep the left-wing party base in a quiet way, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit more in a moderate way.
In the case of the conservative representative with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, who was nominated as President of the Council, the ruling opinion in Rome was that a political balance should be established.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be the Vice-President of the Commission, Juncker.
The EU Parliament's approval that is still pending is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that the Mogherini, who has been well-known in the leading party offices for almost two decades, will meet the "enormous challenges."
The Roman is married and has two daughters.
She began her political career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which in 2008 joined the Catholic Central Party Margherita as today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO's use in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a force contentious, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives since 2008, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he asked Mogherini to become his Minister of Foreign Affairs.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent vote of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in the PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The presentations in Brussels, the new EU external representative, have too little diplomatic experience, so that there is no substance, are being countered in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, unexpectedly realistic accents of Mogherini are being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and diffused as a "Russian-friendly course."
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the shake-hand were taken in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin Chief for October to a Milan Economic Summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new staff will be active in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in front of the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all the years as well as the trainers will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day walk and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all the years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "her love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has come up against disapproval by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a modesty gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for the resolution of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had called on his fellow Socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the transmission, in which she appeared at a meeting of abrupt socialist MEPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant quarrels and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the fall or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would be the winner in the early elections and was ready for the government.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dikänn showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of falling into several rival groups before the end of the 2017 term of office in Holland.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel that things are changing quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is, according to the knowledge of the industry, leading advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and to its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, acts under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is about $29 billion in total, and in the coming years it is expected to increase the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises requested the start of the stock market with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise entered the stock market in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to the approval authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises' stock exchange.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A peking-faithful group swung the Chinese flag near it.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, which only allows two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking-faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be elected and encourage pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial square with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China's domination of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
This survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Hong Kong Liaison Office.
The Vice-Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
In the afternoon, student activists announced that they would meet in front of the Hong Kong leaders' office.
By the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements.
Putin demands Kiev to record "state talks" with the East Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on the "state" of the abyss region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status with regard to Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government for eye-to-eye negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents is in line with the strategy he has been following since the start of the attacks five months ago: aid for separatists in the oral of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to have real independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to take back the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area taken as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland," a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the elections on October 26 and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists, are "trapped in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start in-depth discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the state in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, had to be seen to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" highlighted Russia's claim for leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in anchoring the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats addressed at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostock region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the introduction of office on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armored and inciting Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at an eye level followed after a further attack of the rebels in the last week, after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the eastern Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the Asosian Sea.
The separatists, supported by Russia, took over in the coup, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasosk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have started to establish Mariupol, a steel production port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any concrete action and the leadership called for the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reported on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in Ilowajsk by the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey's nobles did not make a fuss about his trouble over hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is Who of the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film town is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking scandal around celebrities have appeared on the Internet.
The Hacker, who is responsible for this, has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also known for their private photos due to an iCloud gap.
The list contains 101 celebrities.
The nobles who had engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reported that a news website said that the hack was "shameful" and that the people concerned felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which she is located on top without a pool.
The film works of Palmer include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence 'said to TMZ, "It's a hideous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
In purely legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, jogger and hiker were there yesterday at the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg and supported the association "Help for cancer children."
The tour, which was a torture for one, was easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove the bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put the little muscle cat away, especially since the participation in the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
A little break on the way in the apple curve?
No, if I'd stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early dew to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, it was easier to overcome the well 11 km long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
The very in red green politician from the roundabout - red dress, red bike - did something at the start on understatement ("A lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then at the mountain proved to be half a professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the line in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, the press speaker in the city of Oberursel, who had taken the road together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triatholds, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we are happy to be there - an exit we would have made today anyway," said Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung to the saddle at home at 9: 00 in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then with fun to roll home.
It was fun, too, "Frits-Toni."
For the chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
With his 6.5-kilo racing wheel, he had been on for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there, "said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist."
He must be, too, because he was on his way with the "fixie wheel," which is also racing wheels, but without a circuit...
It was not only the 20 hikers who went up to the top of the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, made sure that he was safe, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sledge trail, only that he is pulling the sleigh himself." So the man is his own sleigh dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - had been sent to the route in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10: 00.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the club "Radelen on the Große Feldberg," gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the line up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
