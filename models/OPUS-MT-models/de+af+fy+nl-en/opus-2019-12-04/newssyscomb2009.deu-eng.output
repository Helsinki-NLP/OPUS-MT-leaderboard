Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total they come to 29 percent
After the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria brought about a significant weakening of both parties to the so-called great coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly hard losses, where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the line.
In contrast, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landesbahnmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal policy.
The results so far show that the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and this is a truly catastrophic result, especially for the People's Party, which had called for the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead in front of the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculation about a possible resignation of the party president and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers think that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, which is to renew the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right-wing parties - the liberals (FPÖ) received for the time being 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed to the populist (then the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even resulted in sanctions from the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to work with each party and is starting from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also moved into the Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slid from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not move into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg might see a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister in New York stressed this after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive was difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all that, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, it would, according to Mukherdshi, be best if he were to appeal to a higher instance.
He could so request bail and wait freely for his judgment, the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian Minister said.
At the same time he said that such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that, "led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, confirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he was given the undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter, was the Minister.
"I've already been promised a lot," he just said.
A Czech judge about the ring around the bottom of the sea
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are shown.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent sea base.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is following the interpretation and supplementing it.
This is where there is a great deal of work and enthusiasm.
The bottom of the sea has so far been a little known world rich in natural sources.
This is where oil is found, the other ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also to date unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
Today, the countries of the region were vehemently reporting their claim to the new sea areas.
In fact, according to a UN Convention, they are using their rights, to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shell, which often reaches to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shell.
"In terms of simplification, the part of the seabed and its soles, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface, is considered to be a continental shale.
It crosses the borders of the shore, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shell must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful, "added Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas, has recently come to an international echo.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will come to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement."
Where the continental shale ends, the area of the ocean soil, which is called the "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention, begins.
No state will have a special position here.
The right to promote in this area gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold-digging land," says Director Mikulka, with a little exaggeration, and adds that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
This was given the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor" by the Convention in 1991, as was the case with the investors of a few other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the area of ClarionClipperton in the still ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the sea floor.
"There you can promote on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff member of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary scheme that brought the legend to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on the ground in the event of a hostage exemption
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists who have been abducted in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
As a result, both specialists in the Federal Defense and officials of the GSG 9, the flight staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Centre were at the site of the liberation.
However, as the speakers of the ministries continued to report on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners go and fled when they had seen signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Fortunately, it did not come to that," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Rumanian and their eight Egyptian companions had kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the free hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first Chamber of the US Congress has just failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
By 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the 700 billion-dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was investor concerns that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered just before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was known, he fell back down again.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizer records increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the German people's desire for travel remains untouched by a study.
In the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in sales compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the investigation of the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of the travel agencies for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on data from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is high for the whole market.
This includes the travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the US was in particular required, the DRV informed.
In this case, the increase was about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local gefilde, were particularly requested by the Germans.
In particular, travel would be high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing cost of energy and food, the cost to the customer was "better to calculate than on the individually organised holiday."
For example, consumers could save money through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that compared to the previous year there would be a further increase in sales - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip was down compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter-crügen and celebrity in designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV-moderator, and she's wearing a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling on us and they are cutting the memory cards in full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Wurstäquator, the feeling of well-being was still limited to that.
But first arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone is wearing Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks attached or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
It's a strange look at the Schokobanan stand. It's just my drenched sprouts.
A Munich woman makes me aware that I had misbound the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, in the back widowed."
I can't help but feel the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and unasked to stretch the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, who comes from England and also visits the October Festival for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with a long-drawn "ooooooo."
That's what he's telling me after he's been rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, all of which think he's a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics walk in a crowd over the parking lot, who have to take care of the poor swimmers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like with most of the Wiesn visitors: Learn to go, get back all the way back.
You can't see who's in the Promille coffin under the plane.
"This is the one who took the goarnimmer," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in the mess.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for the suspicion of light-headed driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial desire.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building is sitting on the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German city hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to fall apart
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket switch, there is no doubt about the superiority of the project whose most western access was that.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a spatter in the imperialist game, had to dominate before its ambitions to implement the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects raged during the first World War.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insuperable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train went to the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen apart, far from history.
Today, however, this railway, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all to the east of it, to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Tucia.
The ruling justice and development party, the ACP, has introduced a very new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Notably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, Mr Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state plan to turn the back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the ACP's main office, a specially made, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and pubs where medium-sized managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She should do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I was talking to said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can, in the transverse sense, go on the same railway tracks east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had been watching this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there was not much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was thought for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir was last singing in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) was for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to it, whether it was a Madrid or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How many times did death stop us from "making music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings! "
His kind of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never herrical but never overarching.
However high the musical level was, he always called for a higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years about I have written reviews for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to haunt with one or two known peacock in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... while at the same time studying for a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry."
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
He left Nottingham in 1953 and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are in black and white, in documentary style, fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments. '
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large limousine is still a much larger one.
This also includes the technical fins that make it possible to save even more comfortable driving and petrol.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the aim is to highlight the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other producers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the jazz had appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models a year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models. That's 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while remaining shares are distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it is 5 centimeters larger.
The height, against it, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double charge system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance while at the same time providing high torque power for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min? 1.
This petrol engine - the previous model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Auto-bee" that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the black behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Head of Technology PR and R & D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facial eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which allows them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to reflect the overall perspective, the technicians developed the so-called laser range finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for the prevention of collision
'At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90 ° or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other systems of any kind is that this evasive maneuver is taking place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the mobility laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but also not overlay; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
'This device only needs to process the information for a couple of seconds and to act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made to save, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal while driving, while avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets a mortgage.
One must understand that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly paying banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', they say.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of the bad loans' or the mess-up.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice and up to three times whether it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but no details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen if the game is extended?
Well, if a dream room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes their capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a new one due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's tribal shares at a single price of $25.25, which will result in a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the price of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley said that the global business will be made on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars against 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley took this status last week, which is to enable him to extend their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago ', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, said,' we thought that the participation would be entirely tribal.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price value for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will result in a reduction in the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into stock shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker from the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said that since the end of August, he has' clearly 'reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been hard on the group, which had to look at how their exchange rate fell by half, while the price of the insurance against insolvency accelerated.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had raised $15 billion, some of which were at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Reestablish the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who, following this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, chose the plan of a new constitution.
In the vote, 64% voted in favour of the 'yes' vote.
According to these results, 28% voted in favour of 'no', 7% of the voting cards were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, a vote must be reached more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls at the polls and a census of a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'yes', and 63% to 70% prophesied it.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the government's seat 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean-like Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transmits the state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange, sending immigrants to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also gives the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and that he will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as the starting point for American drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon and unharmed.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to the Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign country of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers' were not paid a ransom ', said the Egyptian Minister for Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the roller field.
After being captured on September 19 at a ground car safari at the foot of the mountain Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the next of 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding place.
It is 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Rumanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night just before dawn.
"On both sides, shots were shot and half the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said the responsible person, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role that the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units played.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and the special units," he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a ground vehicle in a patrol, in which the kidnappers, of whom they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army said that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unite (SLA-U) movement, but this movement was immediately in dispute.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pathetic sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are very starved to death?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making EUR 3.5 million available only for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, by mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, who are gathered in 211 history societies, are working hard to deal with history, to save the many private archives with a few grogs, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision-makers let go of their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state-owned parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux States want to take a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is the result of the US financial crisis.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could be a precedent.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries are buying the respective shares of the bank of about 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its shareholdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, while in the second half of the week there were already serious critical scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a broke.
The securities of the institution fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the fact that Fortis shares are in the valley.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested person with a real offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, they said.
There has been no panic among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken stable
Because of the drug consumption of a human being, life and health insurance in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will trust the fox with the chickens "- quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage, depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical investigation and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he has taken the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, i.e. which products were bought, and the program calculates what disease the customer is suffering from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically lead him to a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk factor, so insurance only has to do the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and heat-like, but also against depression.
The latter is, from the point of view of the insurers, a high risk factor, while the above is not.
For the processing and processing of the data, their own companies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although failure to do so has not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them to the data on drug use. Thus, they provide an even more accurate picture of the state of health of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use is at the same time becoming more difficult.
Although there is a personal data protection law on health data, its impact only covers health and insurance services.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his programme so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly deny access to his data, because otherwise the insurance companies will not contract with him.
And so the chickens are just kind of left to the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme, together with other global problems at the ninth summit.
The French-Indian summit is also taking place today, which is mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and participation in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to just over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be encouraged in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to balance the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, was among them, and the convening of a UN conference was also initiated.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides being responsible for failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as did the proposal to conclude a global compromise at the next climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that French companies will receive EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right-wing company.
The international Frankfurter Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and introduce more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The subsecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meters exhibition room "Punto Italia."
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: this occasion will discuss the figures, trends and perspectives of the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing in the whole, but in particular in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of the billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago, was found again
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, who disappeared on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was found.
The parts were found on a high plateau of 3000 m high, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely disconfirmed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane was located, and a force was sent to it. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office for Road Safety (Ntsb) announced that a team was sent a few hours after the aircraft was spotted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found by a couple near her house on the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two ID cards with the name Fossettes, both of which were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002 he was the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he was flying around the world in a single flight without a plane.
Among his many records is a 15445 m high flight over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls from the traditional schemes through its original design and the special line line, the unloading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has been trying to get a new breath in the sector with this off-road.
Just because of its exceptional features, the Suv Glk's performance will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17.
The advertising fraud that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various stages that will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, to give a special look to the whole: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car is so apparently emerging from the poster on which it is shown.
The new glk is then illuminated in all its details in different moments with the help of the Elumina8 technology, in order to reunite as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of car advertising in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk a stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for which the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been after the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The sponsors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia came to this.
They carry the Tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fishing scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were displayed on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was in the process of running a ban on stadium.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of impersonators who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and that does not in any case give such behaviour the possibility to justify it," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision), on Tuesday the casms, will be able to count on a part of the aise, that is, the secret services that are dealing with the problem of stadium power.
"Duce-Duce call and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi) for a few weeks.
Before that, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, is now coming from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but the behaviour of these 150-200 people was certainly a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - add the number one of the Osservatorio - crimes are being punished in the country of their action.
So far, this group had been in control, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and what will happen.
But we are also talking about the puffes during the hymn of Mamelis: this is not a crime either, but they allow me, but there is no education.... "
