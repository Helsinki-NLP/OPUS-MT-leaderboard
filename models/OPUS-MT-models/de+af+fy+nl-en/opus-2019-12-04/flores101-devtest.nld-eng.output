This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the cloak of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The find also gives an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely to be a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - such as weatherhooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that these were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this sample shows exactly adult feathers and therefore not the done of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the cloak of an adult and not the dons of a chick.

The weapon of Uka failed as he held it to the head of a fifth man. Schneider has chronic pain, is blind in one eye, misses a piece of skull and his face is reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider made his statement through video link from a USAF base in the country from which he was from.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo also participated in two individual races of the championship.
Her first was the Slalom, where she got a Didn't Finish at her first run. 36 out of 116 participants got the same result in that race.
In the other game she took part in, the sitting Great Slalom, she became tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4: 41: 30. That's 2: 11: 60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1: 09: 02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who ended up ninth.
Four of the women's group skiers for the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and it did not succeed 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish wife's rapists were arrested and found her cell phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them got hurt.
However, the driver had serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first recorded in Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted of killing her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She's in custody pending the charge and the trial, but the eyewitness report may have been obscured because her story has been published many times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have identified the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
Crown Office has the overall lead on prosecution and has indicated to journalists that no further statements are being made, at least until charges have been made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted to see on the basis of the limits to the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only prepared for a five-year presence.
In the additional anti-animal test, the guards had to be closely monitored, as the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a cooperation between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Observing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting had a comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore a nine-headed new provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
In the last four years, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former National Electoral Council, which is part of a package of measures to allow for new elections in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that took place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods that get overheated have been reported. Overall, this led to six fires and four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was familiar with the 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents with overheating that the company called 'not serious'.
"Very regrettable," was the government's response to the fact that Apple delayed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 7: 19 local time (Friday 21: 19 GMT).
The Northern Marians' Calamity Management Office stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manilla, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 gun, Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and at least six dead victims have been confirmed for the time being.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was finally shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed the example of his father.
He was educated as a midfielder at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins did in his spare time research on early birth.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government researchers have found two "black boxes" with flight records on Wednesday.
He also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first" Queen of Extreme. "My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons, just as unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more rarer... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people questioned for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who resisted the fact that Australia became a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that, after the government of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
34% of the participants in this poll supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29% of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31% said that it should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three event games during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the drugs he needed to soften his pain, because they were forbidden on the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and information professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number at the moment.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to be able to understand the way planets are formed, and they would like to know how the earth has been created, given the fact that it has been a long time since comets have come into conflict with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was previously a governor this year and signed a law last month that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and talk."
It is speculated that he would like to apply for the presidency in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel each year for a lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground radar, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and to provide more clear information to pilots.
No additional transport is used and no above-ground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P & R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the cross of a native Darwinfink, the Middle ground fink, with an immigrant CactusGrundfink, the EspañolaGrundfink, lasted longer.
Gold can be processed into many forms. It can be rolled up in small forms.
It can be drawn in a narrow wire that can be turned and braided. It can also be forged or rolled in plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be applied to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You are already making an indicator using red carbon juice.
The colour of the carbon juice then changes on the basis of the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powder together, make your hands wet and clean and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a toilet that was connected to an advanced sewerage system.
There are sewerage remains found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were already WCs in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the Roman era, wCs were often part of a people's bathhouse, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite has been shot into space by a missile. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere forms part of our light and image.
In order to operate a satellite or telescope in space, you must have a huge missile that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are average-size catfish between that average-size prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as walking cats that are kept as pets) that hunt on larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has, so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males that are family to one another and have up to 30 females and puppies.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A bunch of lions behave almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly much like lions (but not to other big cataws), and are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not good), swim, jump large distances and have five times as much pull as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopard and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar out of full power like a lion.
The favorite meal of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they do. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than it is.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their odour to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very inconspicuous. Ocelots hunt for prey by making one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) are separated from the large population from which they come (for example by moving over a mountain chain or river, or when they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other raw materials and other enemies are present, so the new population must start to change or adapt in order to face competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from the appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Soil formation is an unpreventable effect and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhale people and they take carbon dioxide on those people exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants remove their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made of plants, we eat mainly plants, without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain from that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone but other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had more than 70 slippery teeth, plus an additional set in the palate, which means that nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not sure, but it could have been his tongue. It ate turtles, big fish, other musasaurians and maybe even his own kind.
There was nothing safe for the attacks in water parties; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar with us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including ewes, peacock, snails and some kind of rodent called a sleep mouse.
In addition, there was a difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during dinner, but rich men liked to keep together a banquet where they were lying on their side while eating.
Meals from the Roman age do not contain food that has come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no old Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made for all their gods a primary temple. This temple was seen as the own house of that God.
They made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with the organization of ceremonies and parties.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes as part of the temples towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggaratten.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the God.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Steen was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
According to Norwegian statements, Erik was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way to the west and gave it his name.
He did this discovery, but there were already Eski tribes there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, habits and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
You may think, after the film National Treasure, that there's a treasure card on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words' Original American Declaration of Independence, i.e. 4 July 1776 '. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (from 29 ½ inches at 24 ½ inches) was used for storage.
So it seems that the term is simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French who were on the side of the Germans in 1940 and therefore howling with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated South France within just two weeks, then they went on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, the term civilization, which is related to the Latin civis, which is a citizen, and civitas, which is a city or a city state; and that also defines the format of society in a certain way.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a permanent cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognised as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a Congress.
It did not have the power to raise taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority and trusted in the implementation of all decisions on state authorities that often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between States.
First, all the States had to agree unanimously with the articles before they could be adapted, but the States did not take the national government so seriously, so that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordfights, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports is particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest island of Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster / group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe drive along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the south-west of Taiwan as a base of excellence, where the VOC handled the indigenous cereal production processes and put Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), and in 1885, Taiwan was incorporated as the province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Shimonoseki Convention in 1895, which transferred the sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which the island ruled until 1945.
Built from three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Ramen.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can have a better picture of what they looked like before.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and the renovation is still under way.
For example, worldwide, the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analogue film era.
These are produced to date, although it is the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor took over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The image ratio of this size (divide by 12 to get the simplest ratio of total numbers) would in that case be 3: 2.
Many common classifications (e.g. GSP-like classifications) are equal to or a close approach to this image ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is a lot of abuse and which many find ridiculous, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic, and yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. So you share the image vertically and horizontally in three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-penetrating power had influence on everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the Church has money for this reason.
The church has been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years and this relationship of power and money has led many people to start to doubt whether this principle was respected.
Great Britain set up a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the extermination of the hostilities.
The strategy was effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital facilities to military and citizens, but this blockade was a violation of the generally accepted international law which has been laid down in various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that all parts of the ocean could no longer sail ships, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unraveled undersea warfare of the country.
During the 20's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a seal and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; every phase of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the various dynasties in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han- and the Jin-dynasty.
During that time there were violent wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest to book. Thousands of people died in the battle to be the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had great social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from the absolute monarchy to republicism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its inhabitants instead of a single leader.
For all male applicants, functions could be obtained after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army. The army ranks are no longer based on one's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class into a revolution in other countries.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with the issues of the superworld, and he often went to a cave that later became known as the cave of Hira in the Mount of Noer.
The cave itself, which has passed through the tooth of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountains on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful air and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear from the cave of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven world wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many great pyramids in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The plateau of Gizeh or 'pyramids of Gizeh' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sfinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built as a tribute to the women and family members of Khufu.
The up-bow character looks like a V and the down-bow character looks like a sneeze or a square of which the bottom is missing.
Above, you have to start at the point and push the iron stick away. Under that, you have to start at the archer (the place where your hand holds the iron stick) and you have to wear the iron stick.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to outline your personal signs, but do not forget that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, which means that they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a group of market women sat behind the departure of the deathafraid Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They went back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jolting and threatening furniture that threatened the King's couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles up in front of a deathafraid queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism with regard to the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay tax to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Filipino government.
American imperialism was largely based on the huge profit of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templars, one must know what the context was that led to the formation of the order.
The age in which this happened is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages the high Middle Ages came. These were followed again by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a large range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict feeling that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a path that, for the most part, extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has' effects' on societies that are inherent instead of being socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive car ownership also leads to a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques in order to restore the human body.
In the romance a large part of cultural determinism was included, which was from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the romance, the geography formed the individual, and over time, habits and cultures were created in the wake of this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the laws imposed by the arbitrage.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of the feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire decreased in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders came back with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of the fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic fourth are high-time days in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a style of its own began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the crusades: people began to use buttons to confirm their clothes.
Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture which produces sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture for the purpose of living is a simple system that is usually biological, using stored seed that comes from the ecoregion, combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to make the yield optimal.
In the past, most farmers used to work in self-sufficiency, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures ensure that people who feel neglected are brought together by social standards, which gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and / or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most used methods to illustrate the importance of socialisation were the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by neglect, setbacks or courageous abuse during growing up by adults.
They are called "wolf children" or "wild children." Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical restriction of the child.
Untradable children may have experienced serious child abuse or severe trauma before they were left or before they walked away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A child who has not been raised by humans may show behaviour similar to the behaviour of the animal that has taken care of the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning on a project-based basis should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffold is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are involved in a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clip man from Microsoft Office is.
There is virtual scaffold that is built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons for children entering the care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, but this is what is happening.
We regard the care system as a safe zone for these children.
The aim is to ensure a safe home, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care.
In the care sector, all the needs that have been neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Graphics theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Ithmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as' personal involvement 'and' continuing relationships' when they examined public reactions on websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable finds in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that no one can recognize a lie by just paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it could be that people cannot understand that speech because of brain damage, can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as house dogs, also have the ability to interpret people's behaviour.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system that looks like that of the human can on the savannah but difficult to get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, it cannot take into account serious consequences: the lack of growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easy to find vegetable sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains very many proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking up all the way.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. This way you have to come out of your bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorithm, for example, are to drink a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (and in particular water or tea, a known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm that a person has is the amount of stress that someone carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the present life force. Every man is able to achieve satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can lighten their minds, only your own stress and negativity are in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teaching of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism is extended with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kudalini-yoga, meditating and a follow-up to universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini-yoga (lighting energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as focus. With the help of the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought to an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, cooperation between the USSR and the United States was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between the system, the process and the culture ensure that the countries got together.
The former allies stood in front of each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would take 40 years and fighting with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces only continued until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridge head in Romania.
These plans, however, were overhauled in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded the Soviet Union and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-attack treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the Navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport persons and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is being hindered.
The US tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WOII, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German Navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times they began to keep cultures and tribes so that they could always easily get to her, meat, milk and skin.
The domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat-keepers, like the more well-known sheep-shepherd often a child or a younger one. Today, the same is still used in the same way.
In the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
Although horse railways were only made up of a track of boards, the horses had to run faster and faster than on the slightly difficult roads of that time.
Dwarsbars were used quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were built.
The first form of transport we know is running. People started to walk up two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means standing up man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk up.
In the fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations were found.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases it is like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we have to identify the cause of the problems and remove them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly changed the Earth, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle.
After the declaration of independence was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten design was sent to the printing company of John Dunlap a few blocks away. This design was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now better known as' Dunlap Broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops in New York on 9 July. Another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap transcripts are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that today there is still a dinosaur species. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two rear legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately clear. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of drugs or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is called "mittens" by entomologists.
This term comes from an age-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that are very well-suited to the human being.
Both red predators and bedbugs are nests-bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or house of their host.
In the US, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the main neurological disease in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spine and the eye nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice as much chance of getting MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopted, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discover how the world works using the scientific method is the main purpose of science. This method is the directive for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just a test; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question signs and to make observations, as a guide to scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood the Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of the Greek decreased.
In physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and the production through the biological clock.
Most beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-providing oscillators that run a cycle for a given period of time, even if there are no external signals for this.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to implant their own DNA in a bacteria.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment, the DNA was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other, the protein of the fag was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or may cause cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photography and learning about the orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages take the car to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the biosphere is no longer in the stable state as a result of this huge carbon economy, which has allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or falling bridges are rare in comparison.
How is it that there are so many complaints in transport systems, why is it going wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In the case of a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between the individual shall be considered.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers are reasonably predictable, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in the mathematical field.
There are links between the three core properties to better reflect traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and exploitation of road-building facilities.
Insects began to fly as first animals. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could easily escape enemies and find more efficient food and couples.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
At the moment, only dragonflies and meiflies can't get their wings in.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said the solar system was about the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and therefore the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea through the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main current of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the lowest population.
The Italian language is the language for the official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used much during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to remove them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theoretized that they are going to turn into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are covered by the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atomes are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen has unfortunately been reduced in status and is much less used as new writing methods have emerged.
Nowadays, you write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a point sharpener.
You can wonder what's gonna happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes into the market.
The nuclear bomb works according to the principle that it costs energy to put together a core with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core is split up again, part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means they fall apart at least or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high plains.
There may be more moons on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what people are moving and what they are appealing to.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and / or wishes that are internalised as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and the motivation hygiene theory of Hertzberg.
In general, there are two ways of acting when managers are going to lead their former colleagues, and in one way they are trying to establish themselves as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take imposing decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation discussions, to delegate and to address people on their responsibility.
On the other side of the spectrum, it is transformed into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything their own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, which is because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the objectives for the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness are shown by the effective use of all available resources within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation that is working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management should promote a culture that focuses on innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuous model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, which can reduce the scope of the study and collect more accurate data.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behaviour helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumours can affect behaviour and lead to changes in mental capacity.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are becoming more and more aware of the structures and processes in the brain.
This offers us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that will give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks for which intelligent behaviour is required is covered by research into AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customers' diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is often used in economic, medical, technical and military areas, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
A lot of excursions are planned for each class. A teacher would often take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, to look inside an aquarium or to see beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their journey to the capital of the state, which is redesigned every year and whose previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at the beginning, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical public, the blogger aims to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
In good use, "blogs can help students to develop and think critically; by actively discussing the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario typical in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are relatively sparsely populated and some of these areas are almost uninhabited.
A population comparison that will surprise many: more Afro-Americans live in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the area of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the path from Europe to India, which was the beginning of the European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahel region in the north.
Women: female travellers are recommended to say that they are married, whether they are married or not.
It also helps to do rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women must take into account that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be taken by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and do not be afraid to stand your man (cultural differences do not speak this well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco is Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you can find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, learn products, water pipes and other greats, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located near Rwanda, in the east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano sprung lava and became the largest part of the streets of the city, and in particular the city centre.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you have to check the state of the fight in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the starting point for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the best trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short drive.
Timbuktu is relatively poorly accessible and is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today Timbuktoe is a ruined city, although the reputation of the city makes it a tourist apartment and has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage because of desert storms.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city is different from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has a population of 19,500 square kilometres, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where several wild species are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Park (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily maintenance and access fees apply.
It may also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings from which the Hong Kong skyline is made is already compared to a shiny bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong you leave the island and go to the water side of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close to each other on won land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have established themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the area, you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengal inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps - they also have some of the last powerful pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3,850 km ², of which a third is a boar and swamp area.
The Sundarbans have been a wild reserve since 1966 and the area now has an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axisherts.
During the day, buses leave the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most leave between 6.30 and 7.30 hours, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar / Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most districts, small Japanese Coaster buses drive that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two entrances with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the crossing height 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the planning, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most striking indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sustaining agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly called the "great province of India," was created in the 16th century when Spanish colonists met the indigenous population.
There was a three-century colonization period among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best poloteams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and competitions at other times in the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo games.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted all over the islands and in Stanley you can also pay often with credit cards and American dollars.
On the remote islands you can probably not pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance in what way you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's there in summer, winter is on the northern hemisphere and the other way around.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures are still higher than + 30 ° C.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature is almost never below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains about the same throughout the year, without identifiable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are in the end just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Eland, bison, reindeer, bears and about all the other big animals can attack you, no matter how tam they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep an appropriate distance. These animals are big, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that odour bears and other wild animals attract, so avoid wearing or cooking odour food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is on the island of Upolu.
It was founded around 1850 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom did not want to leave the port, which was later known as the notorious paternity.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the fight for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at a non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One 'is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name' Manta '.
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can just be drunk safely, but bottle water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is' espresso ', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are trips to the reef all year round and injuries following these trips to the reef are rare.
However, ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
From October to April, Kubus walls are near beaches and river moons north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks are very common, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of salt water crocodiles is located in the river mouth north of Rockhampton and they don't normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind with the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation forms, such as a campsite, via a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those present at music festivals choose to camp on the spot and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music is over on the main stage, other parts of the festival site may be turned to the late hours of music.
For families whose children are still young, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Be careful where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in the winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. If you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casino's are usually committed to taking the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in the area of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all the well-known gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go up to the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you have to take into account that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be very low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it is therefore different from asphalt.
During snowstorms, there may be enough snow to get stuck in a very short period of time.
The view can also be hindered by falling or glowing snow or by the presence of condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The largest tourist African attraction is safari, which is the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The term safari refers in popular use to land travel to view the beautiful African wild animals, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetos and leopards, you need a binoculars, or there's a small chance you'll see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') means that you walk several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games took place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you can be in a penile situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between £2,500 and ¥130,000. Normal tickets are around £7,000.
You can dry moist clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow this stuff, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you do not want to wear stretched socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not get too hot (this may shrink the substance or, in extreme cases, scrub it).
You can clean water in different ways. Some ways are effective to address specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to cook water for a minute, in other areas water must be cooked for a few minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, you can drink the best water from a closed bottle of a reliable company.
Travelers can face animal diseases that are not present in their own country.
Ingredients may spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transfer infections.
Usually, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that by force hurt or kill people, are not considered as animals.
Tax-free shopping means that at certain locations you can buy goods which are exempt from tax and excise duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a great deal of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected to each other through the Buffalo to Pittsburgh motorway, you often drive through abandoned rear terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to driving on country roads? Then keep your head with you. You will find many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The set maximum speeds are remarkably lower than in previous and successive areas - usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km / h - and it is even more important here to keep to it than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste fine and in Bavaria the pastries are fairly rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit cakes. All year round, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful pastries, try some that are called in the region of Berlin, Pancakes or Krappen.

The Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept of a variety of regional cuisine from all over the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javan cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers several simple, seasoned dishes. The most common Javan flavors are nuts, pepper, sugar (mainly Javan coconut sugar) and various scented herbs.
Stingers support the feet of the rider and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the driver with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a driver can get stuck in it.
If a horse's rider is thrown off, but the horse's foot is stuck in the bow, they can be dragged with the horse. In order to reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear first-hand riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety buckles. This can lead to the release of a treadmill from the saddle if it is pulled back because a horse's rider falls.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination of Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly discover new routes on the rock walls that seem to have an endless potential.
Winter sports where you fall down, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down on a snow-covered descent with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many lovers, who are sometimes also called 'ski bums', which plan whole holidays around skiing at a certain location.
Skiing has been in existence for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating from 5000 BC!
In 1861, the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-track skiing, ski touring or skiing.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep grounds. You need much more rigid skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good circumstances, you can take longer distances than walking, but it is rare that you get the speed of cross-country skiing on installed slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
However, the Schengen area is almost a single country in this area.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to re-undergo a passport check.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which articles are antique. Some tax offices give the definition of antique goods over 100 years.
The definition may vary by location, for example in North America, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to consider craft products as antiques, even though they are more new than comparable mass products.
Among the Sámi, the keeping of reindeer is an important form of living. Also, the culture around the trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, and they were involved in fishing, hunting and such matters, and most of the time reindeer were used as migratory animals.
Many Sámi work today in modern professions. In Sápmi, the Sámi area is a major source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advice for the country you want to go to, this may have consequences for your health insurance for the trip or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other authorities, but their advice is directed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East can be confronted with situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions include only a short summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a volatile, general and extremely simplistic picture in comparison to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather that can lead to damage, serious social dislocation or the loss of human lives.
There are different types of weather, which vary according to geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of heavy weather are, for example, hard wind, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, water hoses and hurricanes.
Snow storms, ice storms and dust storms include examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather conditions in their surroundings, as they may also influence some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war area should be trained professionally.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the Internet is likely to provide the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues set out here are usually dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually takes 2 to 5 days and consists of role games, a lot of first-aid and sometimes arms training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness. However, there are few publications on war areas.
Travelers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the right documentation for the return trip.
It varies considerably or authorities want to provide passports on which no sex (X) is mentioned, or to update a name or sex to documents.
There is just as much difference in the benevolence of foreign governments to recognise these documents.
In addition, investigations into safety controls have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery may assume that they do not come through this scan with unviolated privacy and dignity.
Mouse flows are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is in a few deeper parts, where a fast flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the dead fall as a result of fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which could just be impossible.
When you get out of the strong current, swimming back is so peeped.
Try to focus on a place where you don't get caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the cultural shock (you have a less large 'honeymoon'), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
It is usually not expected that patience and understanding are needed for travellers who return home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all silence before the show starts.
The story of light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sfinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The tables appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are explained.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrelas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the full-bodied crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausenzee.
This is where the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, then they come out again to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinsonmassif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option at remote locations, where there is no reception for mobile phone.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to stand outside with free view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
It is becoming more and more popular for people who plan to travel and learn in the middle of a year.
In particular, school leavers use this to take an intermediate year before the university without having any adverse effects on their training.
In many cases, a registration for training abroad can increase your chances of going back to higher education in your own country during an intermediate year.
It is normally necessary to pay tuition fees for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination to sail. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A hunt is not necessary for the archipelago or lakes.
The archipelago on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for each yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time, that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This allows you to spend a few full days in the historic place and stay on the ship.
Since 2009 you do not need a separate visa if you are only on shore during a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Fly travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is not a shame for you: it is no different than many fears that other people have.
If you know how planes work, this can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies are given a generous fee to provide products quickly. For business documents, goods or spare parts for a necessary repair time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies were able to use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things through air transport, it may take some routes days before they are unloaded and come through customs.
Only as checked-in luggage could it be processed faster, and according to the rules of air carriers there must be a related passenger, and so you are.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to count down a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, let your employer do this).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about 11 times for the first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Air carriers know very well that there are a group of airplanes who are willing to count down a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable, and the companies therefore charge the appropriate costs.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. This is where the Romanian language is spoken, but also the Russian language is a great deal.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was subject to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by the members of the UN.
Economic links have again been established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
Orthodox-Christian is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the second largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centres that are covered with red rooftops, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city still feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.

In the north you will find the well-accessible, romantic and fascinating place of Sintra. Sintra became famous with foreigners after Lord Byron spoke with praise about the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb-bus 403 drives regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Go to the north and look at the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Mary apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost inmeasurable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women who have survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved those who have been killed there or who have worked themselves dead, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, show all applicable respect, ceremony and dignity. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by placing markings or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the large majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan, because that is the first official language under the law.

Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in different languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude and arrogant.

The hard outside of the Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing.
The Plitvicemeren National Park is heavily wooded and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, sparrow and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are particularly many different plant communities, because of the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying levels.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the raised, along with all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are obliged to wear a skirt over their knees and must have their shoulders covered.
Usually you get a cover as a woman when you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you take your own copy with you, with nice, yummy colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will kindly allow you.
On the other hand, men have to wear pants to a minimum over the knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time after the end, so you may not feel comfortable with it. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (in particular pork) and is widely used for olive oil.
A simple and popular meal for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to flavors such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-righteous nouns, just as you mean, always have a capital at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
This way you make a first name difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to find out whether a verb or adjective should be used as an independent noun.
Most of the Italian words are written exactly as they are spoken, so the ruling is generally very few problems.
You have to pay most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows.
You also have to say the r and r differently: caro means love, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
The reading of this introduction to grammar already teaches you a lot about the grammar of the Persian and helps you to understand your senses.
It's pretty logical that if you know a Romanesque language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so much like this that you don't have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution at the time was not as big a problem as today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, better accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossom and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossoms of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which requires you to suppress the tendency to remove even 'only one' species.
When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you are denied access to the garden directly and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available after arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees on the north side of the equator, you will experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the air is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses in the north direction to Hebron, the buried place of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
See if the bus you are taking Hebron really goes in and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Domestic waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loiredal or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise trip to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world have also taken on many traditions that belong to the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological statements for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, a Passover is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend. The congregations often celebrate a feast to the glory of the resurrection of Christ in the middle of the night.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. This made the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctica have a pool night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means that you can also enjoy the star sky.
The Japanese working environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Packages are standard working clothes and colleagues call each other by the last name or function name.
The focus is on group performance rather than on the price of individual work performance.
Workers often have to be given the permission of their managers before they can make a decision and they are expected to follow the instructions of the managers without thinking.
