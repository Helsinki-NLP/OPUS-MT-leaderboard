Fire in French chemical work deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, was deleted. This was the prefecture of the Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anracers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical industry already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak removed the gas methanthiol from the plant in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled like lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman announces her job to search 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days of the dog missing any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was sick," said Carole King at "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room as they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog panicked
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says," She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "Carole King remembers" Daily Inter Lake. "When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But for days there were weeks. "I have never given up. I have never lost hope," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake," who announced their job as a postal agent to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears are flowing"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, "according to" Daily Inter Lake. "" The tears flushed. People stopped in their vehicles, got off and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them. "
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six type MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In the last few years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of gunshots of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. In most cases, the stay is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and almost 20,000 gunshots of ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the German editorial network reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun and a 3474 shot of ammunition have so far returned. The weapons and arms parts still missing are, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3 guns, four G36 guns, six signal pistols and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 gun tubes for type MG3 machine guns are missing.
The volume of arms and ammunition losses in the German military was "frightening." Renner criticised that the list was not visible, said the left-day officer, Martina Renner. This was all the more true because, in the course of the investigation, little was found. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet." Renner criticised that the list was not visible, whether under the missing ammo was also the one that was found in connection with the investigation against the suspected German military officer Franco A. "and that was recently a support of the renco.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker was on the move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was declared as the target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first. It was said from the shipping company that an official knowledge from Tehran was wanted to wait.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" was accused by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on the Hormuz Sea Road of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar of the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil port is shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been increasing in the last few months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR to the peaceful revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had waged the then GDR regime, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Th√ºringer CDU Group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded among other things of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken from the horror," she said.
Musk is aiming for extradition record
Tesla's quarter may be holding record. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrok."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it was said in Musk's circular letters. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went out of the market with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be produced in the current and next quarter. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Enigma: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from ticking themselves. This was found by scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin using experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. Progress had also been made on the question of why children are so strongly opposed to tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the coming of a tickling hand causes laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the brain, which is already causing laughter in the expectation of the tickling.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats with "laughter" react in the ultrasound area when ticked by people. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the large brain bark that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touch
To date, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and contact by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the affected area of the large brain is suppressed during a self-touch. This was also the case when living beings are cleaning themselves. However, while the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists had been made to laugh the activity in the brain and the impulse.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter was also suppressed. This meant that the rat's brain could not distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. In this case, they sometimes stopped this initiation in the experiment, showed escape behaviour or starvation. This ambivalence was similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the tickle was a behavioural reaction that was the same in rats and humans.
Dismissed disaster: large-scale fire in French chemical plant deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, was deleted. This was the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances at risk of health have been released. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-Andr√© Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical industry already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak removed the gas methanthiol and the environment smelled far after lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's waste water system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on the speech of Boris Johnson at the first meeting in Parliament after the withdrawal of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October, if Brussels does not respond to his demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but how it intends to achieve this is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who was committed to the stay of Britain in the European Union, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to reunite that country would have been to make the EU's exit." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Reminder to attacks of Oslo and Ut√∂ya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Ut√∂ya with 77 dead are revealed on Saturday in Norway a memorial in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They remind of the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsruhe is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. For the opening, among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first launched a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and after the island of Ut√∂ya shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not solve the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the road of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical research, said Reedereihe Erik H√•nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Nice that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the sea. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the tanker on 19 July under the accusation of having disobeyed the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well in the circumstances, said H√•nell. They had acted professionally in the light of the difficult and exciting situation in the last ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government, following the establishment of the "Stena Impero," suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar, where a supertanker of oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, was put on the chain in early July. According to the authorities, the supply was in breach of EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjectures that it was a trade business to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil port is shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been increasing in the last few months. The trade shipping was brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
After the tensions between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear dispute between the two countries stands. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of trying to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had left the international nuclear agreement alone, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time to stop its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the government in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent agreement that was extended to other areas.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of the commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the road of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States, and without foreign powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal duties imposed by the US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic of China are forced to redistribute. Financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering moving their production from China to another country, India, in a UBS survey, have, however, not only been forced to dispel the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, it seems to be a more important role in the world-wide production chain.
But now India itself has become a focus in Trump's focus. Determining from the Hadegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs," America has taken away from the emerging country from the trade advantages for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US is prohibitively accusing India of high customs duties and is calling for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and others.
On the world map of the trade wars, the travel arrangements with India are, of course, a side-view. In addition, America is also looking at the world's largest democracy through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concerns about China's power rights in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American criminal duties against India is unlikely to occur. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, should therefore be safe.
The problem, however, is in another place: the empirical theory that open markets are accelerating economic development has a heavy state in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reformer is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity that suffocated all the entrepreneurial spirit in the many-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive more rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more regulated insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for a more rapid liquidation of dead companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned to the better in India in the first five fashion years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. This is the case, of which the national conservative government has even created new barriers to the protection of internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is radically renewing his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never moved from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus to become fit for global competition. Businesses who survive through the closure of their industries are among the people who choose to go to the short-term political party of the country.
Replacement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state was buried on Monday in the Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP reported, calling for the Chirac family. The funeral would take place in the close family circle. A public funeral in the Paris Invalidity was scheduled for Sunday, as the media reported.
The competitor's goal is: Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletic World Cup
The world's top was already in the goal, when in the cold-down Khalifa International Stadium, the heart-warming scenes took place. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swam dangerously. He could hardly hold on to the legs at 300 meters from the target, but he was in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly caught him and, in support of the last half-stadium round goal, brought him to the goal. The forces in both were not enough to stop the current situation.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly brought the attention of the gathered journalists to him. Shysters he first came out, did not want to talk at all about his heroism. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time, and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one of his fellow sufferers. And anyway, he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup. In normal circumstances he should not even have started to run for me. "
He did this with a lot of emphasis that evening - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroism will remain in memory. In particular, since Dabo even left his competitors Busby the goal and took the final place voluntarily - by the way, five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with a lot of help, because the Busby was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Association in the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, it was possible with 18: 10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of Mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
In the past few days, the police had increased their road controls and the phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Adversaries of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been no protests with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction company and actor Mohammed Ali, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million marches" in central places in the country today's country, but the people are not calling for the people's "as well," as the people's "as the people's people."
According to two groups of observers, the number of arrests related to the protests continued. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Any arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested," "just because they were 'in the wrong place' at the wrong time," said HRW, calling on lawyers to arrest. According to their lawyers, the charges against the arrested range from "dissemination of false information 'to the membership of a" terrorist association'. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW, were also arbitrarily questioned and searched by passers.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: shipping agents should be able to donate retours more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While it was not possible to free the companies from the turnover tax on cash donations, the Ministry explained to a question of the Green-Bundestag group, on which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would not have to pay any or little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that when orders are made on the Internet, the federal citizens would send back every sixth package. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the trash. They would cost the companies additional money in the current legal situation, because the financial authorities are assessing cash donations such as a turnover that will then be charged to turnover tax.
Green Group leader Katrin G√∂ring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear by a decree that companies are not able to assess products for sale and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," will be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "underlines the reformation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the South West of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had reexhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, which was called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Deleted Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a hard exchange of views with the opposition after a forced break by the Supreme Court, which was imposed by Johnson. Johnson would like to carry out the Brexit that had already been suspended twice on 31 October, if not without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England he painted a picture that is a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The strong verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament, according to his top advisor, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy was a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will (from the EU) exit and we will win."
Johnson had a hard attack on Brexit opponents in Parliament in the last few days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" to the people. Incriminations that he could put the Members at risk because they could become, for example, the goal of murder threats, he turned down as "Humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to get back to peace is if the British Members finally respect the decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it was said in an explanation. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the Uno General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General's debate in New York. "If that goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have had three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region from the autonomy status and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government's response to the current protests in Egypt is hard-handed. It has been using sharp ammunition to shoot the population, over 2000 prisoners arrested in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been undangerous. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to avoid a scenario like that of the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government, drove millions to the streets. And that is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi is not able to control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he is financing: Nestl√©, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi so. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dimma will always have a lot of trouble in the supermarket, if it is a large part of the world of the world.
T√ºv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstopper" for the main airport
Two months were checked to see if the complex system clamp is working in conjunction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the process. But the T√ºv is not yet finished on the BER.
After large-scale T√ºv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This was for sure, said supervisory director Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert L√ºtke Daldrop spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal to work out. "We have many detailed issues, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until the start-up still contains buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not expected to be too large, and the application is now to be submitted to the Bauamt in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables are still to be fixed; the T√ºv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of the operation, it is necessary to continue to work hard to deal with the deficiencies," he said in a written communication.
L√ºtke Daldrop said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the nozzles on which the cable tracks are hanging. The airport chief expects it to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had led the project to a further crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke hoses that are going down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should start operating in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros since the beginning of 2006 to the opening of the next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October is to be held as announced by the chairman of the Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finanzchief Heike F√∂lster changes to the Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, head of staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked F√∂lster. She has put the airport finance on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up - police capture man
He needed money for drugs - and he blew up some machines in the Chemnitzer city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
Over the last two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on Bu-rgerstra√üe and Further Stra√üe in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the development of explosive explosions in the unit of crime, with a particularly serious case of theft, which was found by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only about the 33-year-old."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now has a total of eight actions.
The police speaker: "With the prey he has obviously financed his own means of payment." The bomber had blown up four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019 on the Bu-rgerstra√üe.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The machine bomber is now in investigation, and the police are continuing to investigate him.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for other machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price fight with low-cost aircraft such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," confirmed a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease," including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. The routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna was integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times are to be coordinated on connection flights. On the one hand, the aim was to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to develop the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product was to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants came from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight number are no longer in Terminal 1, but as the AEA in Terminal 3.
At the airport of Vienna, a price fight broke out after the Niki-Plite. Ryanair's daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease," which the trade union as a circumvent to the collective agreement criticised.
The fight announcement by Ryanair's head Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, replied on Friday's AUA board Andreas Otto: "We will remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) has stopped for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holiday at the beginning of the month. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are very pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," said the couple, which has been together since October 2018, in the official communication.
And on the other hand, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information on date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the marriage of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburg researchers want to look at the inheritance of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The K√ºhne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are one of the main factors that can be affected by cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients at the University of the Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
At present, in more than 4000 of the around 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - were known by the clinic. Every year, about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other popular diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university heart and vessel centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney, as well as on cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the K√ºhne Foundation, Klaus-Michael K√ºhne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The Institute of the Foundation in Davos has so far been dealing with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be created on the medical campus in Hamburg and a professor for bioinformatics was created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics company in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart and very grateful three years ago in Hamburg.
The biologists of the healthy participants come from hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study." With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the case of the data collection, the scientists were strictly concerned with the protection of the anonymised data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Mech from the University Hospital in Zurich.
According to UKE, the human heritage can now be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. The following year, the first results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have liberated more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran school. According to evidence from residents, security forces searched the school in the North Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, as Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them indicated that they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and being "improved." Indeed, the protectors had been held by their teachers under "most degrading and inhuman conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of nine years of age, had been chained in a small room.
According to the data, the Coran School has been in existence for about ten years. Residents would have drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, said Sabo. They would have known nothing about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Coran schools. They replace the often poor state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border to the neighbouring state of Niger over the last ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from appalling circumstances. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said Yakubu Sabo police spokesman in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a clue in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of man." The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, were held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV images showed off and injured students in a clearly poor state of health.
World Foot Election: Other allegations after Messis and Klops K√ºr
Football "Signature not valid"
J√ºrgen Klop, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain stated that he never voted in the World Cup election, other countries have been accused of the Fifa. Egypt was not even considered - with a curious reason.
A lot of the Fifa has proved to be offensive in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Football Election has not been suspected to be unclean - if one does not see that the voting national trainers and national team captains of the member organisations often vote for sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after having already complained to Nicaragua's captain that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt is complaining that the voices of the National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes to the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian Association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also a cry from Sudan about the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that the coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the same way as it was considered: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Man√© on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was the same, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
From the association came the message on Friday: True, but of course it was no intention. The completed electoral documents were "erroneously" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it in a communication of the association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosa, had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it was said in the communication. But both Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases are now being examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but it is stressed that the electoral process was supervised by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Cup election - and J√ºrgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans are in favour of official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly declared themselves in favour of an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, the facts that are being found are determined by the facts." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking action. An impement procedure can lead to the withdrawal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to examine the activities of the democratic president and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said that Trump was watching Biden "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few have shown discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, such as the easing of environmental protection rules and the tightening up of immigration rules.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, was also in favour of the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have no formal participation in the trial against Trump, which is decided on in the Congress. Their statements are therefore primarily symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also made a critical statement about the situation. In the middle of the year, for example, Romney, who represents the State of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the Republicans have first internal cracks.
The affair could result in the opening of a withdrawal procedure against Trump, and the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, and they accuse it of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the removal of office procedure. With the majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek a so-called impement, but the decision on an actual removal of office was in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a procedure are low.
Were there any torturers on Rackette's "Sea Watch" board?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unlawfully controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. So three men who are being accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a host in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their punishment in Italy. "We cannot rule out this, but we have no secure information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebouw of the German press agency.
In the middle of September the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even killed. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities were exposed - by repeated and permanent physical violence," it was said in the communication.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing. It is therefore likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that it be followed."
Italy's former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being identified in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk is seeking extradition record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Elecrit."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was called in Musk's circular. The challenge was to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be produced in the current and next quarter. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there were last losses.
US budget dispute: once again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without any expenditure plans before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (continuation resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a part-session of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to enter into force.
Shutdown turned off
For the time being, the Federal Government is now being financed at the level and in line with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the Federal Government cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly capable of the majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are interfering with the wall building plans and their financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building the spirits separate
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue, and more likely than an agreement on all 12 expenditure laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. In 1877, in order to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, to prevent the travel activities of the parliamentarians and to hold back their wages until the new annual expenditure plans were available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The presentation still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics had warned in the right camp that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a Bioethics Act that defended health minister Agn√®s Buzyn as an "opportunity" for society. It was the modern family in which there were children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertility for all women is to be borne by the social security system.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
On the other hand, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that widows should give access to the sperm of their dead husband for an artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization "post-murder" is allowed. In Germany, there have been cases in which women in vain complain of the release of the sperm of a deceased man. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a child was then a "particularly heavy fate."
Many members of the government party La R√©publique en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had, on the other hand, expressed their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow was imposed on a "double grief" if her husband's death still did not satisfy her child's wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the surrogate will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flights for Unis are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at universities, which is why the country wants to take a climate issue in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities are also to be limited in flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate issue on flights from universities and universities, which had been postponed before the summer break, is again on the move. After the National Rector Conference was sceptical about a "urgent" advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral countries of six Baden-W√ºrttemberg universities and a pedagogical university for a compensation of service flights, which was the first step, at the same time, had to be given a broad debate on the preventability of flights, it was in their opinion that the CdU was not yet approved on the draft decision on the CdU.
Russia reapes North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the arrested were supposed to have been illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a change of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, they said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic lack of food, so North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own information, is patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
In the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nagodka and Pojet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after the actions of local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of North Korea fishermen, the media have been arrested on a temporary basis this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-cut synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small living beings from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be replaced.
In the future only 18.000: USA will reduce the ceiling on asylum
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is being protected against those who seek protection: as the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal movement of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. In the already almost finished marketing year, the limit is still up to 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to receive protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been set.
The ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US "the most compassionate and generous nation in history," a phrase that strongly recalls the language use of the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he has a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible threat to the removal of office.
The US government, as shown by the Foreign Office, wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and who are in danger of being put in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to contain immigration at the US-South border with Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orangutan female, at the request of the Argentinean justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires, has been transferred to a reception station for apes in the United States. Sandra, born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person," therefore her release was mandatory. The animal was taken by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday night - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as Andr√©s Gil Dom√≠nguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram-heavy human feud is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is to live in the open-air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles," former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before moving into Florida, "Sandra" must have a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandra" fundamental rights, which was launched by animal protectors in 2014, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park, where a research and education centre will be created to preserve biodiversity by 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergsteiger Dani Arnold has taken a new Husaar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Zin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he offered the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder at the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profit. The net profit in the past quarter increased to $1.4 billion (almost ‚Ç¨1.3 billion), which is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, as the Group reported on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct," with which the Adidas competitor directly turns to its customers online.
Sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike's sales increased with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of China from its approach to directly address consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial director Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments Nike would continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus increase its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Long-term stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been condemned by the fan on Instagram. "Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action." @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am, "wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He had reported the account of the fan to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma party was never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. On a regular basis, Italian fans skate racist charges against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the statement were racist songs in the first league between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 of the leading fans of record master Juventus Turin. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. The others are subject to prohibitions of four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-fishing groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigation into a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "military-controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and would have blackmailed Juventus staff to get more cheap cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennia are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole years are thought of with grim names. Look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially started the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on 21 September, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern end of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has the ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started to grow crab in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a leading industry which has provided for high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and a technology-based crab farming, and the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has set up a reform to "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and government services," with care the service network for "one-stop-shop, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for lending," which aims to fully optimise the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully takes advantage of the local benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost to the development of intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as those for environmental agriculture, which are leading in the "3 + 2" area, and at the same time, Gochun has been fully developed to the development of a national, all-encompassing tourism and tourism areas, of high-value for-quality tourism, and the development of-quality services of-quality tourism, and of-the-value for-cultural services of-the-cultural development of-cultural services.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, has spoken of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return, the United States would have put an end to all sanctions for talks with the Tehran leadership, said Ruhani on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump opposed the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting should take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of sanctions that should be put to an end has been put to the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this move had not been made in an acceptable way, criticised Ruhani. In view of the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
The fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Octaay on Friday. This will increase the concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. On Thursday the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes, Octai announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrim Immoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built homes collapse - among other things, m√ºrbe made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, city planners such as the well-known architect M√ºcella Yapici have warned that large open areas, which were registered in the center as a refuge, have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the G√∂lc√ºk-Beben in August had the Chamber of Civil Engineering of Istanbul warned that one million buildings in Istanbul were estimated not to be safe.
The epicenter of the quake of Thursday was in the Marmaramaeer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers depth, as the Civil Protection Authority Afad reported. A smaller afterquake caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrim Imamoglu reported on Twitter that the damage or damage had not been reported at first. The state station TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Slivri district for security reasons. Some students wept as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North-Atlantic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength may threaten 7.1 to 7.4, but when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday it hit the West of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything needed to stand next to house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth fades. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, after his return from New York, that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul's mayor Ekrim Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to his information, two minarets of mosques fell into the districts of Aviclar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings waved. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been more severe than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned about afterlife via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is stated at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a subsequent quake, which was given with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of the strength of 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmararegion - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmaram to the west of the million metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It would have made it more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the station. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will come."
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on the Lake Constance this year the earth had prayed.
Parliament: New Z√ºndbau in Ukraine affair
Two brilliant documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint about Trump submitted by an anonymous notifier and its controversial telephone with the Ukrainian President mountains as important evidence of investigation against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt." He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - redirected plane
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was redirected from United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight 1554, the airline was informed by the US media.
In the event of an unscheduled landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour she had been locked in it, US media wrote to other passengers. For the further flight to San Francisco the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video that is to come from Flight 1554, according to the US media, a number of people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?," says a man. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was open at first whether the woman is getting compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Change," the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported that it was about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams," who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is determined to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shameless as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions are pleading the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as an enormous ungodly," is gradually excluded from the family and society, and finally goes to the bottom of it. "Ian McEwan boils down to Kafka to describe a world that stands in the head," said the Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce the noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Gy√∂r and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, which come from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility infrastructure summit.
Thomas Cook: All trips until October 31 cancelled
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019, one day after his insolvency application. Travel could "not be started for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, √ñGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As is the case with the start of the business from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the sog of the broke of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travel, √ñger Tours and Bucher travel, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels again from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are still home to Thomas Cook, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travellers are not immediately asked or otherwise forced by these hotels to pay for individual hotel bills," said Mr Bernd Engelien.
The insurance thus responded to reports by hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on the spot, some of them had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesperson. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook package-holidays were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the holidays and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich insurance, however, only help the travellers who are still on the road. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who are still on holiday. On the late Thursday night the company announced that all travel would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to those bookings that are already paid.
As it is about travel with the start of November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, it was said that the further procedure was examined. In principle, the insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibility of reimbursement of the travel price and use a web form to claim their claims.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
The British Prince Harry in Angola has set off and destroyed a mine with a blue splinter protection vest.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive body in the Savannah landscape exploded without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explorer who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a paved minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which has started in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Standing Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he will not have a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made in the polarizing British for a long time, and the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain is like a damocles' sword over the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course by the end of the week was cancelled, and a law adopted by the Parliament, Johnson, in the case of failed negotiations with the EU, however, had been categorically excluded from the Johnson's bilateral extension to 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass by to Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October in the event of a non-settlement:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful to be optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out of time for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. For about six weeks now, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement up to the end of October seems to be more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not put the law into effect, a further shift of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the case of a no deal.
US Authority: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to 12. Furthermore, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the US Health Authority reported CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine," there have already been more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been divided into online networks millions of times. The construction company and actor living in Spain demand a "folk revolution." For this Friday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to whom critics accuse corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to see mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities, in any case, have been alerted. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence has already been observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed. In the last few days, the police had already increased their street controls and the phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been protests with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded hard. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since the past week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW informed on the appeal of lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had crashed the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg he was welcomed, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg, with the race yacht "Malizia."
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had in recent months examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often done with the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the milling of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, they said that they were measured with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and were fished with nets for microplastic.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas," the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadavcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades."
Toure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euro for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros of drinking money included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are detrimental to the reputation of Rome. We ask the police to check whether this is a fraud," a speaker from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came soon. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified it. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with a withdrawal procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be in the public. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has made the conversation out of concern for national security and for the US's democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to help the government of another country to influence the election in 2020. He has made the most of the dependence of Ukraine in this process, and so he wants to force it to act against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be found in the now published manuscript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center of which, in addition to Trump, is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, in May 2019, the story begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation to which we have the right," he says. He says. He can say that it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be persecuted in Ukraine, because there is very helpful for these clients, "it could be very helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed to Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton was conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigation in the USA, but this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is about the very investigation that Trump is about to speak to Selenskyj on the phone in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: the former Vice-President and the current high-profile candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, has pressed for the release of the then Ukrainian Attorney General, Viktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active, the Bizenor, the people of Ukraine, to extort the family.
In fact, the course was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation of the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Schokin himself was accused of being deeply corrupt, the US government was not by far the only Western partner that was pressing for his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp disorders: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive interference with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, especially Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allesturung.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3.30 o'clock. Instagram also reports that content could not be loaded. Also, what app seems to be affected by the problem, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co.
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July the services had been cancelled for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users are also taking advantage of Twitter this time in order to air their trouble.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polish scientists were saved by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of the Antarctic. They were on their way with a tux boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30 we got the message, just before 10: 00 we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the boat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The refined researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT charge wireless
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have finally come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although the wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn of the wireless loading of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have, however, always measured more than 30 degrees in the case of perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging path. If the phone is something next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging path increases, which in turn drives the power consumption.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery is not only a loss of capacity, but it does not last that long. The life span is therefore less. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. As a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has last of all the costs for a battery exchange even increased - and that is for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply place the device on a corresponding charging path - these are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a burdensome cable salad and heavy plug-in. As Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) is a global standard, with the exception of which even Apple is involved, there are few restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and has thus set a record, his expedition operator reported.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has already made international headlines: from him comes a picture of mountain climbers who are standing on Mount Everest serpent in the spring.
The image of the mass range triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest summit of the earth. In May, 11 climbers had died in the climb in a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th eight-thousand: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to speak to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police speaker reported on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fortress, which was visited by many tourists. According to the police, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously held themselves unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretically on their killing.
Persistent British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was established by Iran. According to the IRNA news agency, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the British-flag tanker under the charge of disrespecting the rules of the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the pleas of the travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. This is to be about the board's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not want to give financial support to the company that was fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the company as well as in the control of external auditors," said the committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the bowel cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family's increased risk of colon cancer seems to have been overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to weigh more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colon cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrok." The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110 '000 orders, it was in Musk's circular letters.
The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly, and Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
The information fell to investors: Tesla's shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95 '000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be produced in the current and next quarter. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there were last losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctant
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned that he is looking for ways of circumventing the law last adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the date of exit if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" which makes the negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a line of proceedings that would shift the entry into force of the law to the post-EU withdrawal period.
Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European partners in the dispute about the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European States show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they were not at their promises, he "further steps" were taken away from the agreements of the 2015 Agreement, which was negotiated in a difficult manner.
The conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalise economic relations, was the result of the agreement in 2018 alone, with the aim of forcing Iran to a change of course in the Middle East policy, which was considered to be aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with more stringent conditions, and is now reinstating hard sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded to it with a "maximum pressure" re-entry of the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least prepared to use the installed centrifuges in early September. According to IAEA information, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans would not be prepared to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and the burden of US sanctions, probably Rohani, but there will still be further discussions which hopefully have a solution.
Rohani continues to denounce Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the common ground changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Hathi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had known about the attack, which was considered to be a false commitment by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate could not have done so. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to be unable to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet crossed by other star solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep of the universe. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized to 2I / Borisov after its explorer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The long-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Following observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I / Borisov is the second interstellar object that was seen on a flight through our solar system after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights from the vicinity into a foreign solar system before it fades out at the moment. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the canaries reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported Davide Farnochia from the US Space Authority in a Nasa communication.
The comet is, according to the analysis, on a so-called hyperbell track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer, the interstellar weld star, which was first led under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was discovered by it the name 2I / Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov was already seen in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterisation of 1I / 'Oumuamua, in a first study, determined the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini observatory in Hawaii show a clear fade of the comet.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar weld star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added Le√≥n's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAB, suggests that these objects could open up a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such step-visites are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might be able to catch a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to place the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet-interceptor) on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth. According to the Esa science director G√ºnther Hasinger, it is to either rely on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic it is so far: at the new Mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, some 45 million passengers will be taken off each year at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's recent prestigious project is also called "Seestern" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runway and runway, which will later be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had said several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has been postponed. In Beijing, however, a first passenger-machine has already landed after four years.
New aircraft will fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of that. It is intended to make this flight, which was scheduled for the 2030's, a special drive in the run-up of a sound speed (Synergetic Air-Breaking Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the British company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire has developed. The US channel CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said the station's Head of Mission Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 20 years of its very advanced work and it is already in operation."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency was planning to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As the only oversound aircraft for passenger transport was the Concorde from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, and it took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a concorde at Charles de Gaulle airport, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed announced a plan to develop the NAX space agency. "
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times the speed of the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable space equipment."
Rebuke in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous typos in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday in front of the United Nations Embassy in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past "a little different" was dealt with.
This was regarded as an attempt to intimidate typists. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio footage of the speech on Friday. Democrats were outraged at the President's statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for a withdrawal of office against Trump. Their allegations are based in particular on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raises serious allegations against Trump and its government headquarters. On the basis of great public pressure, the statements of the notifier had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country is involved in the US 2020 election in his favour.
At the heart of the charges is a controversial telephone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his fellow in office to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his prowess from the Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine phone: leading government staff would have tried to cover the exact wording of the conversation. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made, but this had been removed from a database that was normally provided for in the White House, instead of being stored in a particularly protected system.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the so-called "Whistleblower" had distributed second-hand information that would have turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no typists or spies.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given information to the Whistleblower, it was an outrage. Nancy Pelosi, the president of the US House of Representatives, was concerned and complained that Trump's statement once again underwent the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been going on in various committees for months against Trump and its environment. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now moving forward with new force to launch a possible withdrawal procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Intelligence Committee in the representative house, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of a false presentation of things and again called for the committee president to resign. Trump regularly denies ship and had already asked for its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy area, who were most of the people working under democratic, but also under Republican, were in a statement of support for a possible withdrawal procedure initiated by the Democrats on Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it was said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could, while seeking a so-called impement procedure, the decision on the actual removal of office was in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for the success of such a procedure are low, and so far no US President has been relieved of it by an impement procedure.
VW Works Council: jobs are being "shrewd"
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of the production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the car manufacturer's works council around. The brand wants to reduce its annual manufacturing costs by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled by the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. Furthermore, employment security will apply until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from the business councils, jobs in production, which were not actually for the disposition, are "slipping" over another way - that is, past the official course. Thus, free-becoming regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no way of forcing the redeployment. Meanwhile, there are many missing staff, the labour density is increasing, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicles would be greater. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is made as agreed in a socially acceptable way along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardise production even more worldwide and to centrally control new projects. This will also reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann's production board said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
In this way, there are already successes: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Hauptwerk Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants are finished components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that there must be built 800,000 cars every year to ensure that the plant is sufficiently profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilisation in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems of the switch to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test.
As the production director Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are to be rolling off the band, which is to make it possible to combine the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is remodeled to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of golf and Tiguan have recently developed. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. He is to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburg for the first time, despite all the efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: Human traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been swords, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerian people in need had to make a ritual oath in the home of a Voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan slugs in tubing boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arrived in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels in order to complete the alleged cost of shingles of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the reward was completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the incitement and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on Bordelle in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the verdict. "Some were properly attached."
The judgments are based on industrial and gang-based inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimpling and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
Fim permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo air crew with strikes.
If the company did not return to the negotiating table, the trade union would "inform on 14 October about the labour-fighting measures in the LH Group," Ufo-collective board Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with the Ufo collective bargaining for months. It is also a question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo's board of directors, Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Landeswerkgericht Frankfurt to have Ufo's status as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argued that the union had not set up a representative board of directors for months and was therefore unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
In the course of this, many members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board have resigned, including the long-standing head of the trade union, Nicoley Baubles. Because of the doubt about their leadership, the Ufo had suspended an already started vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet so far, but this is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Commission for Tourism announced that it would increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the president of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimage or visitors with relatives in the desert state. The new rules hope the Erzconservative Kingdom more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the oil field of Churai. As a result, national oil production broke down dramatically, the oil prices were high. It is expected to take several weeks for the oil production of the Kingdom to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for the wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People magazine, had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
The bidders gave themselves the "yes" word a year ago in a New York State Office. There was no greater festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you do not want to compromise, you cannot have a relationship."
Two dead in a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The accident cause has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 km south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 km north-east of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Nature Protection Union reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of risk and therefore before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "severely endangered," "threatened" from extinction "and" extinct "to" extinct "in nature." In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than endangered.
Eberish and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, most of the people are threatened with the threat of the "Sorbus," one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "at risk" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat in Europe is to a mushroom with the Balkan miner moth. It has been spreading from South-East Europe all over the continent since the 1980s and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000. Not to be taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Strawberries and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all the ostracts were threatened, the IUCN said. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to species, agricultural practices and climate change. The molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overseen and undervalued species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the data, there were no dead people. Dozens of people should have left their homes, that 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the day before the earthquake there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced. In the last 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for tremors, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrim Immoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be at risk of earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth's plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time the epicentre was located in G√∂lc√ºk south-east Istanbul. More than 17 000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, a quake of the strength of 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "The bigger will not," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is very excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had been dreaming of playing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists for 100 years and I'm going to perform with another latina." She could hardly wait "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage of the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she was honored to be on one of the largest stages in the world, and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were together on one stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling numbers of spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are one of the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you last dropped the audience numbers, this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the least audience for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the past Super Bowl, there had been a stir: in the dispute about the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the media reports said that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, at the time of the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback, was on his knees in the 2016 / 17 season before NFL games in the national anthem of protest against police force and racism. Kaepernick himself has been uniting since March 2017 and has no NFL game against him for political reasons.
Cook-Plite: Hotels get money from the insurance
Some banks are likely to get the break of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. There are high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affected the credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to make total depreciation on their books of up to ¬£1.8 billion (around ‚Ç¨2 billion), the report said.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciation from ¬£900 million to ¬£1 billion and the lenders between ¬£550 million and ¬£825 million. The amounts actually to be debited should be at the top of the band, an expert said the sheet.
The amount of the losses of the creditors will actually be at the end of the insolvency proceedings will show up. A person close to this procedure did not spur too much hope. For example, the around 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the real estate were in bad situations. Most money could probably be taken out with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it was said.
Rackete was supposed to have brought alleged killers to Italy.
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the host in the Italian Messina. New building stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they had left on their ships. "They come without passports."
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had brought migrants illegally to the port of Lampedusa, and a ship of the Italian financial police was named, and the three suspects were to have arrived there that day.
USA warns the government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network engineer Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large, "said Pai," the "commercial sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges each company "under Chinese case law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, "said the FCC's head. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin would first like to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC's head continues.
He accused the Chinese Huawei group of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai of the" Handelsblatt. "
The US had found out that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the US.
Chemie factory in northern France is burning: schools closed
At night residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours - but the cleaning up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cr√®ches in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not be preoccupied on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to stand down to the smoke. There was no harm. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday night, as the prefecture reported. There is still a risk that after the deletion of smell, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously come up from the chemical industry. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the plant of the company Lubrizol, which makes the additive for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-Andr√© Durand, said to the news station BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" was found in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dust dams had been built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at 2: 40 in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area was at a low level, the Minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to get worse in order to make the necessary decisions. "
The Member States that had budgetary capacity for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these margins, the Minister added, and pointed to the high government debt of its country, which is more than 98% of gross domestic product, and the French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment to boost the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
This means that the French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "surrender law" adopted by Parliament.
The Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could use another loophole. However, the Tory politician is avoiding this possibility.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law that was last adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent that.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" which makes the negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that would shift the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's resignation. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to get an agreement."
In the meantime, Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings stated that he felt the political clashes about the Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit would come to an end: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will leave the EU, not worry," said the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leeve" during the 2016 election campaign before the EU referendum, is now acting as the head of the Downing Street government. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to a much less-developed situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to the death of Linda in 1998, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were also Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front wife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," the art critic Ekow Eshun writes in his foreword. And of course, one is always in the focus: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
He is dancing with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, on the phone in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonbots. Certainly, the McCartney's were an extraordinary family, but that was a very normal life on her farm in South England or in Scotland. So, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it was not always clear at the McCartney's.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the right click: you have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the exact right moment, "said Paul McCartney."

"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn because of the US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been following a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
US government wants to limit the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees, and on Thursday the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a 40% cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, it was the most important task to protect and serve US citizens. At the moment, the US immigration system was overburdened.
The US government wants to focus in the future on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included.
The programme, which was launched in 1980, will select refugees from UN camps all over the world and relocate them in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organisations were horrified at the announced reduction in the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According to his own data, the US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused the insignia in the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever sent the information to the informant who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spitula," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This report a number of US media in agreement.
So Trump spoke to the staff of the American United Nations mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he answered: "This is close to a spitula." Then, Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason we used to do this a little different than we do now."
Observers considered the latter to be a possible indication of the death penalty. The Democrats were very critical of Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional investigation of a possible withdrawal procedure against him, the presidents of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower, in a complaint that has now been published, accused the President of having abused his office in order to request another country's involvement in the US election in 2020. In particular, it is about his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: Trump encouraged him to initiate investigations into his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower himself and its informants are. As the New York Times reports, however, the Whistleblower is to be an analyst of the CIA foreign secret service.
Refugee boat marked: baby and young children drowned in Aegean
People are constantly trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats are often known. Seven migrants have now died in the fall of a tux boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a tuxedo. Among the victims of death were a baby as well as four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a lock, reported the local news portal of Chios, Allithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route.
The Who Cancel Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a long end because of an inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "really not speak now." Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, the Who announced that they would be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old club Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rent set suddenly: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from the small start-up to the driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set up founder Adam Neumann as the boss a few days ago, postponed the planned stock market, and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the managers to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new rental operations with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space has suddenly come from the market.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rents them in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelance, small start-ups or entire departments of large companies. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company has now lost 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs of the rental of new large areas are estimated to have increased to 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management of the company has now taken the emergency brake and the rent of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times," WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with a maturity of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhad, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has been renting almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the last 24 months. WeWorks's new contracts alone made it possible that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas that were newly on the market in that time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased in that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider."
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be significantly reduced without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house bought by the savings bank fund provider Deka last year for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billion revenues. Access to the WeWork's - even short - reserves, in spite of the long-term lease contracts, are not liable for the parent company, as the hire of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by any extra-established subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the last few days, a total of 262 more savages had been arrested who had been illegally fishing in the waters, according to the Russian national secret service FSB informed the Agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there had been no casualties, they said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Coast Guard of Russia is patrols according to its own data for the protection of its marine biological resources. In the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nagodka and Pojet at Wladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans after the actions of local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korea fishermen have been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-cut synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small living beings from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be replaced. Even the ships themselves did not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
In the last week's arrests, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. According to the FSB, a also wounded North Korean died later on. On that 17 September Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second one after the fire had opened.
United States impose a ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed a ban on entry against former Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro and his children. The American Foreign Ministry founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "coarse human rights violations." As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is in favour of a system in which thousands of Cuban would be arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As the leader of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations there by the support of President Venezuela, Nicol√°s Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the continuing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela," the American Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, tweeted.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had declared a ban on entry against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle has been raging for months between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-elected interim president Juan Guid√≥ to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent many secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. The start is expected to be due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move over Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Canadian Montreal. In front of the White House in Washington, too, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the global commitment will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people fought for the climate. This Friday we do it again!," she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries.
A good third of all world demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had, according to the estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities in the protests. This time, according to a list of the movement, the rally was planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, the people want to go to the streets in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
At the age of 15, in August 2018, Thunberg had sat in front of the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This was the result of the Fridays-for-Future movement in a short time. In the climate tests, mainly students and students are involved, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for policy to be more ambitious in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be halted to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic T√∂rn with a high-sea race hunt, where she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she was deeply concerned with the leaders of the world. In her home country, Stockholm, she had been awarded the alternative Nobel Prize for the Protection of Climate on Wednesday.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This includes a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow, according to the Agency Tass, which is to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke still have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Even grilling meat sprays on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Blast against cybercriminals - investigators take out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as an operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through which international criminals operate their activities.
This was reported by the General Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a big action. The Darknet is a hidden part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market," - the investigators had smashed it in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the General State Attorney.
It was said that such a host had been raised in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action, with the support of special units such as the GS9, there had been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It had been the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon the investigators would like to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people are once again looking to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major event in Canadian Montreal.
Who are Thunberg's backmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl of all times has the power to keep the mirror in his face. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master's performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is putting the masses on the move and bringing young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person has been able to get a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne was chosen to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. At that time, it was not the first time that a group of young people could win for themselves and that it was persuaded to cross the sea to enter the promised land, as it was recently made to a sailing trip to the region of the region of the same kind as the region of the region.
But there is a shadow side in this respect? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reaching, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, old-time followers of Greta Thunberg were a little bit more concerned about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick. This is also not unwarranted because the action was very good, thanks to the money and it came to the world's money.
The spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the saving of the world? Is it still authentic when certain people are working together with stock brokers during the world trekking action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question even seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' suspicions have been confirmed: a strange comet is now crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I / Borisov and is currently working on astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov on the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the passage.
The great chance for astronomers is now to catch up from the close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the Comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbell track that leads it out of our system.
Comet was seen before the start - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe him in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua."
First findings on Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 km in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - for as the IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n says, the spectrum of the weld star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de Le√≥n's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. That two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Over and over again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson is appalled by brother
At first his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, denies the prime minister's martial language as "flawless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capulation," "fraud," Treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly reassuring - at least verbal. At the time of Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive indignation of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the station Sky News, her brother used words like surrender as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal should be "hanged, suspended, tortured, demented and feud," which she considered to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU Parliament's anti-Brexit party "Change UK" during the elections.
In particular, she found that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly resident, had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. The best way to honor her memory was to get the Brexit through, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britfirst'," now Johnson's sister was critical. The perpetrator was obviously from the extreme right-wing camp, which she felt very much of this kind. "
The widow of Cox also strongly criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor it was to have a passionate and determined response to what you believe in - no matter what view you are. But never to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere was created in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had set up his State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Member. "I was torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained the step in the past months.
John's language also came up with a sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language "not worthy of this country." In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: in the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots are appearing. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latin community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will be celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the South tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on the stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York, after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000's, she ended up with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is to be seen in the German cinema from November in the drama "Hustlers."
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her breakthrough worldwide in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whever, Whever."
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected to be exciting in the US every time. This year, many also consider the choice to be a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising show. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have made sure of Furore. As a rule, the NFL final is watching far over 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy occurred in the run-up. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up to the black in protest against police force. In the end, many of the musicians, in solidarity with Kaepernick, had rejected a super-Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared, was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber admits Egypt's ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who have had an influence on the return of blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the last week abroad. One of the two moved back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who in 2013 dropped off the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's approach against political Islam and did not have a syllable about the human rights violations in the Nile, "he said to the people in the city of Egypt, who were not in the city of Egypt," because of the people who were in the people who were in the city of Nile, he had not to be afraid of the people who were in the city.
In the opinion of the President of the other man who is currently determining the event on the streets, Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he was not able to access the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter the Egyptian soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the one who is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and teaspoons of the country: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls on his countrymen to rise to Sisi.
He goes directly to the head of the state and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is in luxury, and he is able to build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leader, on which Sisi is based, is accusing Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with these men for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the numbers that are going to be exploding.
After being arrested for the first time last week since Sisi's grip had demonstrated thousands of people against his rule after power, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for the first time in the past week, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. That really many people would be driving on the streets, was unlikely. But it came to several smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the village of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants Al-Sisi corruption were protesting and the police did not take off the police, and they did not even put out of the police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators broke up banners last week with the portrait of the President, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the downroads. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work," most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013, supporters of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi, a large-scale army was set up to prevent the people who were killed by 800, and to prevent the other members of the House of the House.
Mohamed Ali led these arrangements to a change in his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not get together with police officers." But as a retreat, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider has applied for, there are various test options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blind trust the speed of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Central Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider has applied, there are various test options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of the offer and are therefore not uniform and objective," the Consumer Central of Bavaria is to be considered on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by the person concerned.
If this does not happen even after several requests, customers may terminate and may also require compensation. However, in the absence of success, only the way of action will help.
First senior republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has declared himself in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here, is determined by the facts that are being found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the withdrawal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the intervention of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump was watching bides "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned several times against Trump's policy, such as the easing of environmental protection rules and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: More Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will be going separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would not be part of the "Avenger" universe anymore. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should go on.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets a second final third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home." This is what the film is to start in the USA from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant," Marvel-Bos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path is continued in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony is still working on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suites" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suites" in the United States has now arrived at the big final. In the last episode there were many happy ends and also many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was charmed in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoiler to the series final.
One way to go: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the backviews showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his deposed sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just heading towards the altar to marry his fianc√©e Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a great comment about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a rock, the demented Harvey of the bridegroom wants to know only then to point out: "Louis, but you are not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in the event of boat accident
At the end of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the event of the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousse, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are now moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to find out in Turkey "what the situation is about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help in the management.
On Friday, a speaker from the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehower with the EU Commissioner for the Interior, Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior, Christophe Castan.
In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, called the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers last raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU will be able to return all refugees and migrants who come illegally through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take on a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian who was deported.
However, the process of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29 400 people, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst situation is in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently living in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, the state radio reported.

In particular, people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo opanne
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign, was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand in a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green, never held in the hand. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this cup in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and the cup was still a snooze (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green-head must be responsible for photocopying
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party is producing to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection," in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which it is increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their leaders to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and pretended on her blog to have known nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, is from bamboo. She always had it with her. A speaker of the party said it was just to put the party logo in the picture, and not to cover something up. The photo is only a cut from the site.
May writes that it is her suffering for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself about her overengaged team: "If they want to work on a picture again, could they not do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or for flight travel - but their pictures were not fotoshopped. So the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream on holiday with plastic spoon, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
It was said that Jaqueline Ng had been given an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at the check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the business class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
This case, however, shows how one should not do it: a self-declared influencerin has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follow more than 65,000 users. On May 30, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the way up, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly had an upgrade in mind. The letter wants to have the influencer received from a marketing employee of the airline. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of faking the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they were hacking at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail was supposed to have disconnected the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not show up.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jacqueline's ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about ‚Ç¨1,280) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the Influencerin turned to Elliot Lawacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay the influencerin has committed fraud, it remains closed to future flights. The airline's business conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and now turns on a lawyer.
According to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen, oil prices
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon in the shortest time. Last, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea species Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediates (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from Wall Street Journey on a ceasefire in Yemen was a trigger for the course. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia caused five percent of the world's oil production to come to a halt. The Hathi rebels in Yemen, allied with Iran, had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would disarm the political tension in the region.
If an agreement was to be reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
The oil prices are thus continuing its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Last but not least, Bloomberg, calling on insider, had reported that the repair of oil plants in Saudi Arabia was moving faster after the attack in mid-September than was thought. Thus, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels a day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Last but not least, there have been press releases calling on insiders to report on the rapid progress of the Saudi Aramco state oil company in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock market start planning and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepared the departure, while the ship was still in front of the anchor, gave the Swedish radio Erik H√•nell a text message to the Swedish radio on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would move defence missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian archenemy. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had at times driven oil prices significantly up in recent weeks.
Tump charges are getting worse
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, a number of leading government officials had made an intense effort to prevent the use of the word for the White House at the end of July, following a dispute between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, to prevent the use of the word, which was an anonymous guide. The spokesperson of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "hiding." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon bring about a third summit of power-holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and the prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US would not have done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the common military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision of Trumps to bring it back to being.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit was to bring with Kim before he agreed to do so, and that the negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been in place since the second meeting of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to relaunch the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: arms manufacturers should help with mine clearance
In Angola, the British Prince Harry has symbolically set off a bomb mine and destroyed it. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit. In a safe distance, the explosive body exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of a minute, he later called on the current TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get away, to commit to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the light of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing value in relation to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early reduction in the interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) are increasing to the pound sterling. On Friday, the British currency was reduced by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
The results of the sales were statements by the central bank Michael Saunder. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered a supporter of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActiTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit-Hickhack without a direct reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would like to lead his country out of the EU, if necessary, without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says commercial magazine editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) and today's chief of integration of the World Athletics Association.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia are emerging - and they destroyed the little credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. The Wada had closed the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual testing at the summer games in Rio in 2016, had made some 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to attend the World Cup in the summer of the World Cup in Russia as the host of the World Cup.
Positive findings missing
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but requested access to the laboratory and the above samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check that the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada of a Whistblower, and those that they received in January from the Russians were the many who were found positive in the McLaren report."
The World Cup was not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organisation to hold on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put into space manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the new Rusada lock and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
