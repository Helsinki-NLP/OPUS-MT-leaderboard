The main task of the kings was to build a tomb that was thought to be as timeless as the stars would seem over the sand of the time when everything else was sinking. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. War led them to remember the walls of this tomb, in which the scenes were carved, in which the stones were rudely, and certainly a lot of it was made, and in the later days even battles that had not taken place.
The main, property, for and medium words are declared, but the terms are conjugated.
