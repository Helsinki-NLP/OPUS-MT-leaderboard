28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he was up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, informed the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had taken his dream job as a cook in the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked by his death and destroyed on the ground."
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," said the speaker.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "things went up for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something to prepare us for dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the power.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, which was bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is requested to call the SFPD's notice phone under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I always get put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has now made that clear in an interview.
"I will always be put in drawers or get label glued from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not wish to always be perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more of a snuff to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress likes to spend her time at home, in front of a TV with a loose putt and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
To the white gluten she brings the question of the child's wish: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," said the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be on our way from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are obvious.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their end night, they were hunting home in the fast gallop to the feed bars.
One kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV plant, on a horse he didn't even move for photo purposes.
It was the first time in Aachen and also in the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already nodded it.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "for it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was admitted to the "Hall of Fame des deutsches Sports" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hansch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wienke, the sprinter Alwin Shockemöhle and the postman Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are in disagreement on tax and energy policy and on a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
It will go back to a massive amount of regulation, and it will be strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to do, has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton almost say the same thing.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.
So Trump could still have party-to-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to increase the production of coal in the United States.
Oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement is to be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and demands that "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in the case of infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Transpac Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to isolate from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better.
They should be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: one day he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says it should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
His critics are telling him that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fleeing woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who escape alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each one has a baby that is not more than a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks into the room with great eyes.
His mother's staring at the table.
Until she finds out she's being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the business manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and is, among other things, concerned with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as a visitor.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not too much to say: every woman who comes here has had experience of sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing for wars because they are being persecuted politically, because they are threatened by torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as a source of hope," she says.
For women, there are other reasons for the escape: "Many are secretly stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their home country they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murders, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, it goes on.
"For example, the fact that tugs demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that the end of the day when they arrive in Germany is wrong, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee homes are often considered to be inferior and would be abused at worst.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help themselves, it takes more accommodation only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question of whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich in their field of competence, some answer with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and the Upper Franks, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of the governments.
Even in swabby, women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press speaker.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, there are in some common accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations for women only.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee says: "It is very important for men and women to be housed separately."
"If privacy is missing, or men and women are being put together, violence against women can come to a lasting level."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, is stated in the study.
How the women feel about this need for protection can be read from the urge that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about us, we've got a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new work-fighting measures
They have called on their trade union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members that was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "constantly quiet" to problems, which led to the agreement being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour-fighting measures beginning in early September.
The disputes led to the six-time strike of the NHS, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract that had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced by force.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile had a narrow effect and it did not emit much heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report quite five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper said that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, full attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He was vehemently against this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to book some kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear for Ankara.
Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was taken out of office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are restarted.
They count on a late-island storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecast for cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedomosti put it as follows: "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it considers its response to the attempt to take power as a weak answer.
In addition, the continuing grudge about the pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West - is coming to an end.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for asking for support for the elected state institutions after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this glamorous palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described to me, "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that are broken from the West and are badly treated and now united.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be significant that after almost three hours of first-time talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even stressed the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about its differences, while Putin decided to stress it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the head of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the Bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has been distanced when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, Trademark Strait "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with a million pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of brands, for how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the head of the board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket.
He set a milestone on the predilection, which is being trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who won in Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jewel when he gets the victory on Prediction
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern world and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic to fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd already made 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been winning in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismount, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was annoying.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs.
Three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his two and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 51st year of age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is said that Putin "had ordered the release of Ivanov from his duties as president of the Russian Bureau without any reason."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
On the Kremlin's website it is said that he was later the head of the government and the head of the staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State in the field of draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow secret.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is there a consequence of some kind of power struggle here?
No one knows at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president would like to lead Russian environmental policy at once - came up with great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - of difficult posts for four years.
It turns out that I have been President of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the item in December 2011.
He served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical discussion last month in the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its resignation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a communication.
Details of how the character of Gibson from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood in it for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there by the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Enigma of fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spilled by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blower" that are approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 pieces of wire.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fitting.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the land side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern connecting bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Harmful, as the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "to be lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13: 20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on with their own power.
"We saw the boat turn around in its vicinity and imagine the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already swung the boat out of their reach until we left for water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a boje without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but it was removed from the person who controlled the boat at the bottom of the boat.
Someone was waiting for these men today.
Worse hurt - man starts on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously hurt.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When he came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was hurt by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
She couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her roommate.
They met the man's ex-husband on the street.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Green believe that investors should be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "housing action concept" at the next Council meeting.
But the fight is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?
There is a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann said: "We are in agreement with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future identify 20% of all apartments as social homes."
However, the favourable apartments can also be created in the stock.
The main point of dispute in the city hall, however, was, says Bratmann, "How to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as far as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social homes."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the political groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left wants a lot of tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market is getting worse.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff are needed.
It is not clear whether we will get the professionals.
But the program is not yet complete: the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how can one compensate for the loss of another around 1300 favourable apartments, whose support will end in the next few years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning speaker Nicole Palm, the city should now buy out-of-date bonds.
In addition, it would be necessary to consider bringing apartments back into the price line.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved at once.
Because in the West City there are deadlines for the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
It's just that the owners, the housing companies don't want that.
For if the number of social housing in the West City is increased again dramatically, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke said: "For a large majority, the CDU must be on board."
This has been concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been accused by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last but not least to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a string series, play cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July.
The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the film and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that is tracking 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health awareness campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something in the open that makes them enjoy.
Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also murmur gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk into a door.
What are you doing?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world, helping many people to be more active, more mature and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tower
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
It's easy on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant all the way.
And now, finally, Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to a multi-fight title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameraman Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is playing on the floating beam during the women's single multi-camp event in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while strengthening her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Reton said she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other, after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-camp finals of women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party she served as a call sign to the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long way to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
She picked up again with 15.433 on the floating beam - and put another one on the floor with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles glowing red, white and blue eyelines, when the vision that she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a deep-breke.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the fast-growing tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a serial murder case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker from Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more were injured in nine attacks, mainly in the residential areas of Spain within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-old, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his age, Edmund has microcephalia, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I didn't get involved.
What is not right at all -- of course, they have agreed to it, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was' I didn't know that people were still doing it, 'said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walking help.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund made up for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him the character language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Severe rainfall, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected to be more rain all Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, reported by the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparity of the Governor, said that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas through the river.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9: 00.
Rescue teams were still feeding people from the flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives near him would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water was flowing and pouring in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the three of them had been saved in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were located until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "spread out quickly" as there were still severe rainfall and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported a rain of 13.75 inches near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the rain has been a lot of ground since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the community Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the high water and sand bags were provided for the people who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses are to have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "through bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and belly, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He has been through a lot, his little body was lit by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez informed the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators reported to CBS Philadelphia that there was a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron shells for storm guns that were traced back to various storm guns soaked over the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were Hülsen.
There seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here, "police chief Anthony Ginaldi informed the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-beat on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the gymnastics, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnastics has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was cheering.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastic coutines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not what gymnastics look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments on the team. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be that gymnastics are an expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who are able to continue with the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, a trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, a trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more efficient and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year gymnastics.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanks, you can take so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at an uneventful time.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistants, said in a communication last night: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current labour crisis and allow all doctors to be treated fairly."
Only eight weeks, until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, need to be made progress and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through discussions were at the heart of the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes to deafening silence.
That's what happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the force and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work-fighting.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were involved in the cover of doctors on the string.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said, "Work-fighting measures do not achieve anything but burden teams and service providers that are already overloaded, and only worry, need and interruption for patients, carers and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues, such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional period, training leaders, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine, were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have been recommended to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke are caused by the collection of fat-containing material in the arteries that form a siege.
When the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood flow and clog the blood flow to the brain, which causes a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guidance draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correction makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is abusing the police, election observers and city hall to ignore evidence of abuse of the election due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anticorruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barricades outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommended that voters carry a passport to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter must only mention his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger when they vote in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that, after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices in his office, the mayor-in-office of Lutfur Rahman should be removed.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the running of evidence to prove the identity
His report says: "As evidence, it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or bangladesque background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such a behaviour due to" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on oral documents to stop "election crops."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit to applications for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibition that political activists process full post-election and envelopes of post-election.
To give the police the power to set up a lockout for election stations.
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act (National Representation Act 1983).
Photographic ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensify the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal record was made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "cut-off controls" of the election registration departments of the city hall.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kates Radler double player and other famous doppelgangers of Olympic athletes in Rio
This week, fans of the Olympic Games in Rio were out of line and band with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double-player of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic girl is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold, who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood famous.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the US team in the armored Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the United States team in the armored Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter, after the pictures on which he looks a little like the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer got the insanity in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I do not see a great similarity, except for facial hair," said Brady to the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more important this year: the striking similarity between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through it as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One move higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the perception actor
Another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion, Yulia Efimova, has more than just the sun-brown skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans to match an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner in the gymnast Gabby Douglas, which has its own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m Freestyle Swim Staffel was outraged by the CBC live transmission of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday
The Canadian channel CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style pool.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the pool 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadiens to open the gap to China.
The audience in all of Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "????
The idiot didn't understand they were still on the air. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, where many people raised him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we are sorry that it happened. "
CBC, in the end, apologized over 90 times to the people who answered the note about Twitter
The commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show and to our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it should be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's pool in the CBC Olympic show, he said.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no contempt was intended and I am very sorry. "
Buyer in Primark outrages about women who try shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she modelled as she looked in it, took it off and put it back in the shelf.
She continued to stumble and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Buverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Buverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed up again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
"Everyone was staring when she took off the underpants that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might have bought the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take the underpants home that had another person on and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "As I have heard, the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her on and took her off and she wasn't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Whether you are coming from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.
If you get close to you from the back, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker is crawling with pain, the gun from his hands. Hit him with the run in the face and move backwards while they are pointing the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, take the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and point the gun at him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it is Mizrachi.
But remember, in the event of a robbery, it's the safest way to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shakes his tongue in the most dirty places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler subjected his immune system and the strangled eflex to a serious test - by licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, made of Suffolk, shaved his course on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the light.
The thought of licking the dishwasher of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public premises at stations to toilet washers, the task was definitely to put his immune system under a sample
In the film he said, "As a child, I was relatively unworried about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he certainly did justice to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The test was carried out with a luminometer of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of fresh washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more muddy than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything in here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company will equip Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuormaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "
In a 2015 study carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogiation social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left her social apartment after a delo with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were removed from their property by force, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had clapping holes, wooden panels were torn up, waste was scattered on the floor and Graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she is afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think that people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball fighters, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the property where drugs were used in the past, the wooden panels were torn up.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and they had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was able to remove her and her partner from the property by force this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The Delogiation was cheered by the relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have sedated the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant did not accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, since a delusion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be a terrible one for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall have done, as well as members of the community who have been courageous and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours comfort and give the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delo on the floor
The workers of the house administration will now have to get away from the garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon was given a fine after being guilty of the possession of a class B drug.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were decorated with graffiti.
The police say she's going to lose tenants who don't follow the house order.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delusion was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can act without reproach and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are panicked after a deep-fledged military jet beach is flying
Sunset in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air forces set an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video shows how the military aircraft was flying almost in close proximity to the sun-worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understood to be worried about the noise of the nozzle engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet was flying a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time at risk.
This summer, land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted its vision
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans are in the duel around the Spanish supercup against the FC Sevilla, and the back game is three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to renounce Neymar in power with the under-represented Cupfinalist and the ruling Europe League champion, among others, who is competing with Brazil for the Olympic Football Tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing the steps.
The German has suffered in the training a flaw in the knee, so that the question of the one at Barca has been resolved for at least the first time in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the status of number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision on this, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most of the other applications.
Before the first game of the new season, the Spanish Master has doubts about the team's fitness, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0-4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince him at the 3: 2 test-up against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona is the record winner in this application with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in a private league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to the record alone, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"I've played the matches so far for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had said.
After the game, gold and silver medals were placed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he determined the speed at the plate and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected driving match did not develop.
However, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
In his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had suffered a rib injury, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "eventually" settle with sheet.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had, by the way, become the same high-level table tennis age Olympia-Fourth.
Donald Trump admits huge problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is being plagued by massive concerns that even in traditional conservative states, their majority is being lost.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-track and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts of his success are now growing in the fight for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump in front of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was responsible for the false reports of his candidacy, and he resumed his well-known media skills.
The Republican strongholds are wackling
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA survey, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions are looking forward to Trump, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be at risk.
In an interview with the CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he would like to stop the advance of Clinton: "Just as I have done so far."
And after that: this will be "either successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is supposed to have threatened to remove funds to support its campaign if it is not able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress would be more likely to be under the arms.
Olympia: Triple fraud in doping testing
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
After the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, Kenia's athletes are threatened.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Roech.
This had been reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The World Association of IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson reported.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and was a Ferguson Rotich who gave the sample and signed it," said Kenia's head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Roech had become the fourth World Cup in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletic Head of Delegation Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He was supposed to have informed athletes in his country about pending doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping crimes.
In the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games by the IOC, it was unusual to point out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, the WADA took Kenya off the list of countries whose doping control is in line with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, allegations have been made that in Kenya doping means are easily accessible and that there is to be a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in the Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that in this sport, a wide-covering and systematic docking has been carried out.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's very musical!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright."
So she's smart, of course, naive, and very passionate.
"She is very like me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
It's a necessity for him to conduct.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, was reported to die in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bulkhead in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-bombed country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London got on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that in the event of an election victory at Garland, Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday at a telephone conference, Reid said that he was expecting Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the US Appeals Court of the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, that they were Lakaia and the help of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the President's Office.
Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "Women and Men"
The Treat magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of the famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar is doing the same.
"We must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term it could even become "a few hundred thousand," the association president Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the hard process of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association president Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punishment months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the distraught coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevite cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the Federal Government to "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The fire marking as a Gülen trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, before the coup, the Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany.
At the end of June 30, this had been 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as asylum-free (39.625).
This survey does not include those who are fled from war, poverty or perspective.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, that is, state-owned, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals will not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the country-day election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not as stupid as it is so far: summer holidays, heat and the country's election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.
Most of the tourists who are in the country on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count out voices are only hard to find.
By 4 September 2016, the day of the election and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just started.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how much new AFD is cutting off and what is left at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and the head of government since 2008, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, which is not to be seen from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little to the people, just as his legendary, wortsy predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and blamed Chancellor Merkel for the blooming of the AFD.
Their refugee policy, their "We can do this," has accelerated the rise of the legal populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it's like to make a campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major events; Merkel Federal Election is located in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other Länder," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is not too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual stand in market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has noticed that on the land it is brushing away the base, that it must make a great effort to find a link to the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the green: hardly available in the far parts of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow leaders is also self-evident: "They must go to where it hurts, namely where people are: the most village, the golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last stood behind CDU (25) and just before the AFD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had won a clear 35.6% win before the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the country's day.
They make a modern virtue of the need for a holiday and move their campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaign fighters are going to search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gayek, the top candidate, is just curvating through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and it is also beautiful.
Your impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27-Restoration: Hospitals suffer from blocking
The speed with which the B 27 is remodeled, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end at 8: 00, there is all the praise.
"They've done it all pretty bad," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at the mid-term, everything will be ready by the end of October.
It is also commended to see the presence of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of the entrance to the service.
Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße was also lifted in Ofterdingen and the connection to Rottenburg is now again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now return from Ophterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of State for the Transport Management of the Rehabilitation, Florian King.
The residents of Bachzztstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many were looking for ways to sneak and trusted their Navi rather than the signs.
Which led to a number of trucks being in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not met, the municipality called for the measuring vehicle from Mösingen.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There's been a flash of two to three per minute.
The fastest one was on the road with 77 hour kilometres in the 30-zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it had become more calm.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people are not happy to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 redevelopment has led to a drop in sales, everyone you ask is going to let it go.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer," that is, produced for other companies, have little impact on the rehabilitation.
Thomas Sulz also talks about a "maximum slight decrease" at the Maier car house, but also acknowledges that "the running skills are missing."
The most often used are the local ones along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former Crown, finds clear words.
This is already existential.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss in sales is "well above 50 percent."
The road renovation had "thrown back" its plant by two years.
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of it had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27. Now it had to bear the disadvantages of the restoration.
Göhner knows about other counties, where such a generous thing was done.
In all cases, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less often looking by because of the complicated traffic.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his family clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being bribed.
After the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a death status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overdo anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also taking part in this.
However, as the Minister of the Interior, he was in favour of results and of a "possible consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more comprehensive.
Some things are already known, announced, paged: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is starting a second start on proposals that have not been made to date with the SPD: he wants to punish the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to cut off the German passport for jihadists with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He nevertheless considers that this is reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance at all.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it in themselves: he plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
In the case of defamations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than so far - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still unheard of and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply busy could not be excluded even in election times.
The internal security has become a huge focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, it's a campaign.
The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly active on the issue of internal security.
In the last few days, the two parties have been very high.
First of all, there is a serious dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some of the Union's interior ministers, in which the Heads of State also demand a ban on Burma and a return from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling to make the sound of the sound.
He thinks nothing of a turn away from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it would not make sense.
And he has constitutional concerns about a Burka ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show up.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to make a positive contribution to the issue of internal security.
First of all, the party leader Sigmar Gabriel signs a careful willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen can still get through in a slippery way.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of extradition is increasing worldwide.
But it is not in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a word for a word.
Volkswagen will start in the second half of the year with the delivery of the persecutors.
Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite its many brands and some well-running markets, can continue to show an increase in the course of the year.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again charged the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, the deliveries were nearly a sixth.
Brand sales head Jürgen Stackmann brought back the weaker figures from July, mainly on two days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there had been a retention of sales due to "changing economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup trial in Turkey, the British vote was also a burden on the EU to leave the EU, a speaker explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust affair escalated first, there is also a minus to beech.
The large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the main domestic mark of the Lower Saxony is still slippery through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales head Fred Kappler was able to show a sales split from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles were delivered by Volkswagen at this time, around 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer will issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but do not speak of a "guarantee," as it was said on Friday in company circles.
The reason is legal finality.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for remodeled diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW must comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration will occur in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "guarantee," as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, get into a workshop for half a year after the conversion, for example, with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it was also important to avoid any other damage that had nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, as it was said, an uncertainty about possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW did not use the term "guarantee."
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require the rich savers to be penalised in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
On Thursday, bank chief Josef Paul said, "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro- or daily-money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any signal in it: normal savers should not "fear to pay for their savings rate."
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay it 0.4 percent of the penalty rate.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund, from September onwards, by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to giro- or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been holding 40 million euros for a long time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"These are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost," said the bank chief.
"I can't lay down for every million 4000 euros."
He will now pass on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Just leaving the cash in the vault of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!," said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Cooperative Association said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks."
It was not possible to carry it on its own, "on a permanent basis."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or credit transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the main manager of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive charges for deposits, for which competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is more well-equipped with wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it is free of charge.
Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bayern Cooperative Association "no other banks are currently known to calculate an expenditure replacement for deposits by private customers," said Speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition was hard and it threatened the exodus of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not let this fall in the width.
Destination plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment part to oversee him under the pseudonym Non-All-One Coinmen Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennia that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are in all likelihood between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and studying wild before I stop, holding my hands and saying something determining like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early' 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and who are forced to buy their old records again.
From the talks I have held, people have usually abandoned their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
This would explain the boom to supporters of the record review of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a start on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector, and I think that is the case with many people.
It's a simple way to be mindful.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flutes from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I'm going through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it in the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-difficult, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop, instead of experimental jazz, is drifting from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nocturnal psychic traumas are hard to see when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of the plates for sale.
She's more of a showcase than a big buy-in.
It doesn't make much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "it's drifting off with a in-love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to model the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenagers group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that are essential for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's just "record art."
But given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning bumbling through record stores on Berwick Street and the leaf by plates, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator, who has nothing to say about the shoulders of middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebral - video report
More scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says that the record was in a female, which is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer about the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to take down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
In a court trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to take down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who were in the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low-cost trip was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated for the benefit of the community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum issues for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure "for these children would be a disaster of which the last eight years are old."
On Friday, the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
In spite of his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be overcome.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, stay confident and fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"To be honest, it is difficult for me to comment on the time-driving of yesterday," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to the debate.
At the October World Cup in Qatar, Martin was actually going to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the past."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis Profi Siegemund misses semi-final
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter final of Rio: The world rankings-32 from Metzingen was missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA-No.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to make its impact only once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, there was still a chance of the medal hope of Angelique Kerber (Kiel / n ° 2) to jump into the first round.
The Australian Open winner met the Britin Johanna Konta (No 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB start-ups in the quarter final of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic semi-finals.
Group starts to start-up for live video game transfers
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
On Thursday, Microsoft did not report how much money is being paid for the takeover.
Beam only started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The player's Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry has already stopped.
The staff of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and head of Matt Salzedi reported.
The acquisition is therefore not intended to change for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video games is growing rapidly.
The known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online trader Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer Temposinders particularly effectively.
The futuristic-acting development trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary tempolime, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or cumbersome.
The Enforcement Trailer is automatic: its battery stops for five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as time-through bans, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-speed state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with a trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is reduced in the measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, by the way, also shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal countries, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flaming with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7's rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fiji, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearward, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in the best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Seven.
This is where they lost only one.
This sleep will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out wonderfully and had the attacks of GBs shot out of fun.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was hanging in the corner.
With a further four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner, which he turned around.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A high-ranking tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the replay, and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.
Vademo Ravouvou preached through further weak docklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to play.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fiji gap for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favour of the South Island, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the stand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-spat with another try in the last seconds.
The pfiff sounded, the Fiji hugged, and GB kickin 'smashed in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - the UK's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a goal below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late hit by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Asian team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the struggle with the cancer of the trainer to the rudder victory
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games, and that's what it means.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hits that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were on the oar, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present when they were in a row to the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport who laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of the weak, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the whole.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if in such circumstances this is even the right term.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediate victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It was three great years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not stand.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called "stay in the trial, stay in the trial."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backwill.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.
For 31 years, a good example of clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitsteingruppe," Rupert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "Bavarian-wide exemplary."
A small French drinking water target association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago in the original tone it was called in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken appreciated the purpose.
The work of the Veitstein group was considered "bayernwide as exemplary."
After all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the special purpose association for 31 years, of which 28 years is the managing director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Veitsteingroup's drinking water purpose association, based in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are part of the municipality.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was already appointed as the managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the restoration of the high-level containers (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial innovations of water lines.
There was no stop and there were always innovations, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used to work with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitstein group for nitrate control in front of the water forum of the Unterfranken district.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterwarder Alfon's Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterkeeper, and he was a faithful boy.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
In his view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work so that the villages could be supplied with water.
It was also possible to maintain the supply of Neubrunn once, because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is following Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, had come forward well and are now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is two years ago when I sang to the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship at Bargtheide - Man shoots at a life mate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) on Friday around 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man called us himself and said he shot his life mate," said a police speaker.
The perp was on the run, after him being publicly prosecuted.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be on the way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a smooth.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police said.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship place."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide information on the outcome of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but it confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"It's a murder offence."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special mission command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - light view for German steel industry
The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.
The financial burden that the industry was threatened by the production of green electricity is off the table.
It remains in the case of the exemption from the renewable energy levy for the existing plants for the so-called own power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers using gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption to the cash register.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEG charge of 20% be applied.
But this was not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
This would largely determine the status quo of the previous scheme.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment objectives are also to be considered in the reform of the Emission Trading," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate when the world's largest producer country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers are accusing Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been a little relaxed.
On the one hand, the import duties imposed on imports of steel have shown an effect, on the other, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Steel Economic Association reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's value.
In the coming months, the association expects an increase in output thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does good to seniors
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she performed the subject music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does a good thing for her health and her mind.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German seniors' league.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.
By being regular together, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures in the old age dissolve, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the rush so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organisations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher importance, it was part of the daily life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in the elderly arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, the people who are self-demenderized remember long-standing events.
In the case of singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on one's voice and on a given rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: When I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there are enough good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises you.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overview of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior chors are also available on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cat to the cry of the young animals
Biologists in Hanover have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the men did not leave the mating cold - however, they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the level of irritation of cat babies on the small ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens that are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University Hannover (MHH) have found.
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mixing of less and strongly aroused young animals are either unperceptible to the males or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
They were played on the one hand by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with the cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results, despite the small sample, to be meaningful.
"All the females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the very more rainy kitten.
This ability may be inborn or developed with the sex maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have even responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds on a number of occasions in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, another important football game takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is called.
Even when the exceptional situation was imposed after the July overthrow, the government said that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one is responsible for the coup attempt.
It is not stopped before the football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükur.
It is therefore accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
It is said that Sukur is a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the first 90-day state of emergency still applies until October, it actually has almost no impact on the life of most Turks.
The night-time "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the working club Besiktas are not traditionally among the friends of the president.
But what unites the bulk of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of the "Gala" Cup, it will come back to Lukas Podolski in particular.
In the last season, the Cologne demonstrated its sporty value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as a top scorer of his club.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record master found a reconcilable conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also released early in the Europe League.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 goals as Süper-Lig-Torchutenkönig, laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, who was signed to AC Florence and only lent to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM vacation because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Clubhead Fikret Orman.
However, the storm would have to be prepared to give up about one third of its annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistle blogger Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other led athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had been charged with her right to starboard just before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly pimped at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a skurrile scene: with a smile, she was still stoned in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
But there are also many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are starting at the Rio Olympic Games.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-season / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already closed twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion have been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-season / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world female had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after she had been shown to take the painkillers oxycodon.
She had a strong toothache after surgery, and the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner of 2012, World Cup in 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the forbidden stimulant means of methyl hexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowledge and was closed for six months.
The four most wide-ranging throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-season / USA): The Beijing Olympic and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt regretted.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerschrift, Belarus): Not much of an athlete was later recognized.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old had to deliver Olympia silver in 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.

Liu Hong (20 km of walking, China): The world record and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but can still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world woman found evidence of the use of a forbidden food supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency's ban on WADA was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had had cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it.
Her trip home was scheduled for the beginning of September.
It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the about 200 km south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in an outlying area.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two sets of explosives went up again and, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured at the detonation near the most popular beach in the country.
In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the set of explosives was blown up in a flower bite in front of the coastal police station.
After all, several of the victims were killed in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast.
It was said that it was a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee on Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities had received evidence of the imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact time and the places.
It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
In Thailand, there are often smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (level 3) was applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songkla, as well as Preah Viear and surroundings.
After the conflict between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, it is not recommended to travel to these provinces before it is necessary.
Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta-head and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is in favour of having brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to control the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Just a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "identical movement" has become the target of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identity Movement' evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said the Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maassen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identity Movement" is a group of French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multiculti-wahn," "uncontrolled mass migration" and "loss of one's own identity by alienation."
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identifiers."
Maassen said that his authority was in close coordination with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of the Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to speak to them with a young language, often with poppy music.
That was the case with Islamists as well as the right-wing extremists.
This is not a real commercial for your own business.
Propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are vulnerable in a special way.
This is dangerous.
In the last few years, there had been reports from several federal countries on the contacts of the "identifiers" with AFD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important that the respective party - in this case the AFD - change their direction of action by certain people who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in legal crime and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee homes, Maessen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal-terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other legal-terrorism groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugees' homes or attacks from other extreme right-wing motives.
However, a German or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism was not visible.
The previous groups had been created at the regional level or in social networks.
He was concerned about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the cause of concern.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that before had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically insufferable, or for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or left, but who have then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist voting."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that it was sometimes no longer visible in the TV pictures.
It just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends his lead with a 48-second delay and placed the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still take part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a special right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known.
As most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
The preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robles of the Wal."
The English boulevardblatt "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free style, didn't matter.
A comparison with "Eric the Eel" was also made.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani was a media event.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgotten when he had to take a lead over 100 meters of free style alone.
He was a member of the Moussambani family.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Reretsried - The owner of a store on the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old gerettriederin had left her business on Monday around 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8.15, about 250 euros had disappeared from the register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the threatening election defeat so closely
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If it doesn't work out with the election to the U.S. President, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care: "In the end it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, said Trump.
He called the President of the United States Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
In the last place, more and more resistance was formed within his party.
Post is entering the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the journey is obviously great.
The post office plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The group will soon start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Post-board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always questions, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term recommend a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK-Leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignation came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has shown that the chair of the head of the board of directors Matthias Hartmann will be all the more unsafe the longer the success he has promised.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five of the industry is facing a new human start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mölert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He should officially take over the function of a "board speaker" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
The reason for the withdrawal was the company's "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to be mentioned by a company speaker on Friday.
In the future, the leader of the market research company was still unclear.
On Friday, investors said that the last time the shareholders were disappointed at the continued success of the restructuring that was initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," they said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will at some point become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the quandts would do the same," they said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016, after a setback in the previous quarter.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 percent, with EUR 721.2 million.
In the second quarter, the company's lower value was particularly affected by its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area, provided the group with a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had still generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, told the police.
According to the information, the 66-year-old driver of a bus from Eisenach had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a speaker reported to the police Aurich / Wittmund.
"Because of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department liberated the inmates.
Six ambulance and an emergency car came to the accident site on the national road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back from a line bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
They should wait for a travel company's replacement bus.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water will be 3.44 Euro for the Neudorf / Reith / Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant as of 1 October 2016 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to now 2.18 Euro).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an overarching calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 Euro per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the household was approved by the Landratamt Kulmbach, it was found that there are covers for these waste water treatment facilities.
The market in Kasendorf was obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.
The price increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water treatment facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-covers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The major cost increases were based on the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
In addition, in the previous calculation period, all three plants had to a significant extent, not least because of their age, the cost of renovation and repair.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp were almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf waste water treatment plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahal pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to be removed after almost 20 years of operation of the first sewage pond, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed to be able to comply with the water requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were covered by the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that, in the case of the low waste water supply in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "fully" smashed.
In addition, Schmidt had been spared the market community of large maintenance costs for the waste water treatment plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants would continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water treatment network could not be extended to these plants because these are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria accounts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unbeatable, property-turning tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All errors are made to the public.
Snapchat filters have been critical in the past, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote more solid or white skin as a beauty deal.
This week, when it proposed to some users a filter that gave them snitch eyes, false teeth and pointed cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people - "yellow face."
They were wondering if these repeated controversy pointed to a major problem that the company has a diversity.
The news and the outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asian people.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely used by the photos, wrote that the filter was "inconvenient and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-face, but that the yellow-face has been drawn to the devaluation extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no different representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a staff member who focused on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said in turn that she will close her snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that's not OK."
Military leadership misconduct ISIS intelligence information, the Congress Committee notes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congress Committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically copied by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual state of the art on the ground and were more consistent than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail the constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their prescriptions to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts."
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were played to ensure that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centrom created an over-limited process for the production of information services on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-level democrat in the Committee, a member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was received after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. CmDr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still under way.
But he also said that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the interferes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only provided a small crew in Iraq and took little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this was not published, the Times reported in September.
Cencome's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing in front of the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom stands before
One day, after shooting three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keeps their gates in mind.
However, she knows that the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in the same group with the British in the first place, which will remain undefeated after their 2-0 win against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two will be the first and second in their group of six teams.
The first placed will be a little longer away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising twist through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places in the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympic Games in 2008 because she was unable to qualify for the Kader.
Then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English, became a coach of the national team, and things began to turn to the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the work in London that we now have.
We've been able to pull the rudder all over the place.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back hand from the area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lured the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 tour.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging season between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is passed from the arm brush to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's swarm with dimples, could have been among those well-known names that are being sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnastics or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I may make a modest argument for my particular love, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparse for the last 16 years that many of the, I had questioned, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an athlete who made it to the end of the round by 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of its never-to-end impact - but also the grazie of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Exciting winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, lifting and salting) before they land on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to the design, difficulty and "flight time."
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medallion hoppers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only hunting the finish line or the output wall, but also another high-level goal in the television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic code.
The targeted striving is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel as a little tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breath break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she pops off, apparently hard as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is the same as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will emit the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthem and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to be in the air.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators who called for political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that during the clashes with the police, a lot of protesters were killed in gunshots.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses said that the police shot and killed on a dozen unarmed demonstrators.
The videos that are in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led to the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it will break out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are many complaints that cover everything from the use of land to the agitation with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a far-reaching critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this dazzling, controversial line in June called for hundreds of lives.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of shinning under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in the case of protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered in this way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, have been prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat-country areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which account for about 6% of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, in trade and in politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly fascinated to see early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agents to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemyam Desaljn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemiam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands of protests against elections, which, according to the analysts, were apparently flushed by the government and then stolen.
During the following raids many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misfortune.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked shops led by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it has closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin mountain migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been founded ISIS "sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been meant to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capacity of the presidential candidate of the Republicans whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.
It also brings its fellow leaders, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, to the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After he had taken the lead at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was very serious about the accusation.
When the conservative radio operator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is on the brink of Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he was very critical when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is going to be." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who is watching the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has taken an even more serious tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he's more focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal co-conspirators into the uncomfortable situation to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent intercessors, made a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenders, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq.
Most of the mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to bring the situation in the Middle East under aggressive control.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on every word he said and being prejudiced against him.
He molested the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!."
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once over the price pushed away from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front have been pushed out.
Soap Cherie, who replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
It was the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's a new invention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who owns and manages the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of records.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like capers and acidified onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also pushed out of Williamsburg by prizes," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture that I liked in the verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and, inevitably, always ordered the same thing.
"I came a quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepared my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue it soon, so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
A new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like a home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fable for refined delights of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland's water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in the business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Piegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered minced roast, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut butter, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grin.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women bought for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was no longer the Slarafenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense theme for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as bread and casseroles became basic food that casserole as a "wonderful way to re-value food residues," said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
This was the case in the case of a large-scale, nutritious, calorie-rich mixture, which was a priority for taste or even a common sense of kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the afternoon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, the household economy - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - has so driven the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and to meet the challenge of turning plums like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of the historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let me eat" attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he served like the million-heavy man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and was wearing a tux.
He was a great stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting prepared. "
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple said to have better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the plates were cleared off at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a nice name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one of them unwillingly dipped a spoon into the tender, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a rematch three times.
Like a Can-Do-Budgeterer, he said to his wife, "Some hacked walnuts would help."
He was the hero of Aleppo.
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old even died in a facade-bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild-Zeitung, saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to attract people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protection officer who showed him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die to save lives, I think that God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters have thrown four front bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people are in need of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb should have hit terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks are only born at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it will reach an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a level of 2.6 km / h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
This style of life, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Madness," says Alexander Scheurlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are growing old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lute pace when they had six animals in front of Spitzbergen with a transmitter.
The prey still makes this shark: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for cadavers that are torching down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that brought fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as a by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lentils of the sharks using the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments carried more of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third largest animal with 220 centimeters in length, however, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon 14 levels in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-hour for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark at 502 centimeters is likely to be even 392 years old.
Grönlandhai females were only known to have offspring when they were longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of sex and his age was determined at 156 years old, Greenland sharks are apparently able to be multiplied for at least one and a half centuries.
This too is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such methusalema live in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often also running on sparflame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to stay warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal is losing heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have less enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheurlein.
A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in the double pack
The local council focused on building issues at the recent meeting.
With ease, the body took up the message from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated housing area can finally begin."
After the land, parceling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of the land in the residential areas of the "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Bindeerstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in any way in the way.
The council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and rusty seniors alike.
As it was said, builders can immediately report to the City Hall, the local council is expected to discuss the award of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further industrial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the industrial area already identified there is extended by two parcels towards the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from the Brexit
In the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtlande, head of the IW's financial and real estate markets field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether it will be possible to continue to carry out financial operations across the EU from London.
The so-called EU passport is enough for them to be admitted to the UK.
This is what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision of EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council, speak.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtlande.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but it is less likely to cut off infrastructure, just like Dublin.
Frankfurt was much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city points with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlande.
At the Seine, the rent for first-class commercial properties was also 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's business consulting, the city is ranked seven, Luxembourg is ranked 19, Dublin is ranked 33 and Paris is 37th.
Even if quality of life was a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
In London, according to the figures of the State Bank Helaba, some 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs that it had been brought up by the Hepats C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation for the violation of two Merck patents related to the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, US judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to equalize with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and used ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead's medicines.
US-supported troops say they have reconquered full control of Manbei from the Islamic State
United States-supported troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbei near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now going through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbei Military Council Reuters, who was allied to the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of $10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective German tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redhonorare; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax statements for the last ten years.
They paid an effective German tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a strong contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreating in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax review by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organisations, his business and various other links, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already come down on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-level Republican Trump calls for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump did not pay any or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial conglomerate has its seat here, called for Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had also been subject to a tax review by the IRS and Trump was "afraid" of the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective German tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 report of the Clintons showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as a reward, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main financial facility was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton's dividends and income tax of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilipuder, firework bodies promote Tanzanias elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea years ago, has, together with the US nature protection, intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Before that, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is a world telephone day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the Managing Director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not afraid, a so-called "chilicloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition line.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bang and sprays fine dust into the air on the chilipuder.
A touch is usually quite out to drive the elephant away.
One last possibility is a shipyard that shoots a gold-wire fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer investment projects by the business operators with a kiss-hand take on - the retail sector in the core city is considered to be very well-developed.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski-park on the Rhine-Ufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkons under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director is breaking up Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media turmoil after he had told us that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election, since it "requested" Arab guests according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah," left out his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the South German newspaper.
We were shocked and upset by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it "would have given in to the alleged calls of Arab guests."
"Shame on you," it was said in another post, which pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the fast-dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to pull the students apart, which led the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their indignation about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffitits against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate to withdraw from office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the annual trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies has increased strongly in the country's business, the Ambassador has reported.
Russian companies are opening up existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved by the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.
This year, Dzhagaryan assumes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation spent some 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, on Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are broken, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in forest oil
A robbery was committed on Thursday night on the Rewe XXL drink market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the pretext of a gun, three dark-dressed people, who had assumed their faces, demanded from the employees of the beverage market the release of cash and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police won't tell us how much money has been paid.
The perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The drink market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is not visible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the Schotterparkplatz located opposite the entrance to the parking lot with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations at the time of the crime (around 7: 45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery should report to the police as a matter of urgency.
Nawold: Game and fun at summer time
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the Nawold Children's Protection Federation with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet area of the Hartwoudle Reischheim, the lively group was located during the first week of the school.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at Lake Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plan.
In a culinary way, children and carers were pampered with their self-prepared food such as the Saure Spazle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bologna.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of jewellery were created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful evening."
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home in a happy way.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romanesque tour of all the Ministries in the next two years, the St. Anna High Minister round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and it was finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened door of mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenbäch made their way.
The evening before that, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims the blessing.
From Horb it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady stands and the pilgrimage was started by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writing texts.
But also on the way, the Minis on the field crosses, chapels or churches have always taken a rest to sing together a song of specially composed pilgrims' song.
For the nights, each parish house of the local parishes was available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, but it was necessary to climb down about 500 meters in the case of a weak heat and then climb again.
In the evening, the earned reward was a common barbecue on the bathe.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrim in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in the Münster, the Mines arrived at the pilgrim's destination were welcomed by the co-worker Markus Obert.
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Schotte Callum Skinner is storming home when British gold is winning for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's Sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The Jungpfund made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after only a modest sixth place at the London World Railway Championships in March, despite Hoys's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time as the other side showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
In addition, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
On the other hand, he was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, in which the back went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked forward to his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they went on the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenky and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he fell on the track on purpose.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such an amazing victory, there was no such problem this time.
On the other hand, it said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stand."
We've been together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that's what we expect for successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kenky is in the area of the possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That's what Hoy would do.
Kenny will be next in the sprint, which will start today and go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
On the other hand, he said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Dull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the target in 3: 51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had quarreled with the officer before the qualification yesterday, when officials called to him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a set of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas played in the background, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and harassment allegations, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, could be repeated.
The future of the melting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will end in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be a dominant effect as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting company in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, last but not least, because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it would assume that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company informed.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "collateral transactions' which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on GL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL reported that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "Expected termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the melting plant... or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement of why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts a year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as a power generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris, is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand emissary of Estee Lauder and was on the Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché-like act of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8: 00 in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that is more like a tape than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages were advertising from the 832 pages of the forest).
The revelation of his cover star is so expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been clearly more "celebrities that model" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be moving on to the point of mischief.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Local law centres reject 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the country's most in need of assistance are rejected annually by the local authorities, while the industry is concerned with the impact of further cuts in resources on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who do not have the means of unjust delogiations and the like - are already rejected in their requests for free legal advice and assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources.
The director of the community law centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centres showed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being repealed.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unbeatable and extorting debts, families that go through divisions, workers that have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the local law centres and their customer communities, as well as the fact that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign charged after employees allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inactivity, after being informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February, while they were on their way in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini in the Charlotte State Court on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said that he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right hand finger on the trigger, and ramped the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini in his charge.
After having complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he indicated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gun owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of the context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
No response was made to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties are evident.
This gave rise to representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule just as much further, this is not possible according to the Berlin survey staff.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance to continue to be the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was just in front of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AFD.
The left would be 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AFD would be represented for the first time in the country day with 19 percent.
In spite of a slight loss of 6 percent (before 8.7 percent), the Greens rejoin the country's day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD was only 23 percent in the Berlin House of Representatives (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (before 11.7 percent).
The AFD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty big.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "West pocket office."
In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though tormenting slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen were found.
The price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could know in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was finally sold to Microsoft and handled.
Today the market is dominated by suppliers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
The worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only in early 2007, when Apple's chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything easy to use by touch screen.
Apple's victory train started, and still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the oversight.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The name now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kola, in charge of staff in the Siemens Board of Directors.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and all over London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympic Games brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of witchcraft growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third stage, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding display blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it reported that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding for its ads to make it more difficult to detect display blocking about which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-her fight between the display-blocking open source community and the renegade is already in progress since the invention of display-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying it has become for the industry.
According to a study from last year by Pavair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers worldwide; almost four times as much 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook.
The company has it on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker reported.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient proportion of the revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" in order to have more control over people's advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail message.
Ad-blocking is a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman in case of suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over in the early morning on Thursday in the event of a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who are asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after she had run over and killed a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and lost consciousness on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the police officer, who had responded to an emergency call, was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 44.
NASA Klimamodell: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, could have once established Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and, however, turned slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposes its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once likely to be inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light - over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen was removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to too little participation in the team's decision-making process.
The alternative president / general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
I've been thinking for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
= = = Avalanches 2013-14 = = = In the 2013-14 season, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers reopen talks, suspend strike
The work struggles on the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Streks against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolution of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced the rates to its North Sea counterparts by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decrease for on-shore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and all over the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the cluster of Plejades.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster are rotating to different rates and in what context the rotation periods are related to the planet's development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of Plejades is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which was created about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're going to be the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars expel large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
As the cluster of Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the way, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the plejades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say good-bye to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
He was the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million a year since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he created a few milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the main statistics have similar values.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the Hall of Fame.
For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" to have taken on banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect of having received, for years, support for performance through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the block was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I've been playing for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
Even his farewell days are not running smoothly.
While many of the baseball legends in their last games get the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a good-bye tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," the Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received the sympathies of the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Inspired: Due to a positive doping sample, the weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions these news are at an intime.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the progeny over 50 m of free style.
Chen requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association "takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," said Xinhua from a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court in CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible, but the CAS for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Danekowa was leaked, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," that was "an incredible shock," she said to Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is to be the doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-sample should also have been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before, like his brother Tomasz.
Both deny the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is a further serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation of the IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from taking off, except for a systematic doping, and the running distance of Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In the field of swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused serious conflicts between the athletes.
The French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang hard.
"Sun Yang Pinkelt Lila."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of free style, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scams," he said.
In 2014, Sun had been tested positive for the Stimulan Trimetazidine in the Chinese championships, but only a three-month lock had to be placed.
Data claw: So perfide blackmailed hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators to re-use the attacked systems and data.
According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most of the Malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was very rapid in the last few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it looks for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailer.
To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks on several occasions, whose patients may be under acute threat from the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem with it," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user surfaces and contact with the blackmailer and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And when private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos says: "A single person can write a Ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"There is an adjustment tool included in the delivery, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the underground forums, you buy the set from a criminal and you order another to install the software on as many PCs as you can.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then charge Spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data, such as customer lists or price calculations," says Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is still a much higher one than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also have completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l for high and 1026 l for fused back rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema bowl and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceilings.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the charge height is a little higher at 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes in the tested top version "Executive."
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works up to the speed of 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates, because he regards many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The TV assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temporary controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and rotates the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and can therefore be reached slightly cumbersome.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 Euro.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued that liability was only possible in the event of risks typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Sickness: When does the organiser pay
After their journey, sick vacationers only get money back if the cause of the disease is found in the hotel without doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their stay in Turkey was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their disease led the holidaymakers to a defective treatment plant, which had allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip had been poor - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants had no success in court.
The treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it just before the applicants left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
He did not, therefore, violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
In particular, when no impurities were found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence of refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to be sound and determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, it would increase the security and increase the public's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the end of the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further human strengthening of the security forces, "in a medium four-year order of magnitude."
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism must be again subject to punishment.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the right to arms is to be updated in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much discussed duty of silence for doctors should be maintained according to the Maizières words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wants to find solutions to reduce the risk to the citizens, he said, for example, on mental sensitivities.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had clearly opposed activism.
"This was a slap for the scaffolding in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected Union calls for a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
He considered that a general ban on full-cover was a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You could talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green-Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of trying to simulate the power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party chief Bernd Riexinger said, "Fleet proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway operator
It is regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.
But this is to change: the right-wing path is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in a traffic jam when they drive over the highway (A 43).
The national road construction company will extend the right-wing trail by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 and 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
The drivers can then turn right directly from the Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: the traffic is split up more early, which improves the overall flow on the often busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDU Group in the district of Münster-West.
The roadway narrowing on the driver is particularly annoying for the drivers between 5 and 7 p.m.
On working days, the backstair extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle watch on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is directed only one-track over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a good three-quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load force to take up the heavy-duty traffic in particular.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working day congestion will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, it is expected to take years: the bridge has an official rest period until 2034.
For the extension of the law enforcement track, the national company has deliberately chosen the more traffic-less time in the school holidays, because it is likely to be disabled.
The traffic will be carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House."
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the production of the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, has provided the opportunity to visit schools with a welcome class in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenes and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a line through the bill to the stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been bad for the clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The star scales are perseys, which at 216000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest stars.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Recreation night: tips for sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think about sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they may be the basis of a variety of causes, Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.
But what you're talking about in the country is the insomnia, that is, a insomnia and a sleep disorder.
It is precisely the sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This may include organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.
The sleep disorder is not rare, but is the expression of another disease.
"Very early wake-up is particularly common in the event of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
For example, those who have a disc incident can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and may start to grovel about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you become a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment may look quite different: you are turned off, tired, unslept, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical symptoms such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleeping doctors in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the general practitioner, Weeß advises.
This can be done by investigating whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to the sleeping lab, and what's going on?
For the purpose of the study in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in the case of snoring with respiratory suspenders, in the case of sick daily fatigue, in the case of sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just please don't sleep at noon," says Fietze.
After cabling, you go to bed at the normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nostril, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected be able to deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of fixed screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rest times, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to sleep, not avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deimbler has expressed himself on Facebook to the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first got gold at the short-track world championships in Doha, and at the same time made his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deimbler has placed himself in front of his ex-team colleagues who are in the criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets a $20,000 premium and a jungle king €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old at night to Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, but doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate it on the issue of doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deimbler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is the way to keep it with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA / FINA for a certain time before the World Cup / OS may not participate," says the Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice-cream hall.
Airport: Tape of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civil practitioners of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men from 50 to 61 years of age.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage theft as a gang.
At 9.30 a.m., civil servants in Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year, and had taken action in a community, a part of the labour force and a particularly professional way.
The specialists of the Commission for Crime 34 can prove four actions to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had received a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a rest of the headstone patch: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from the east to the west, you pass by the playground, a fresh-coated kindergarten and a biolade.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" to the facade of a grey house.
In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here by 2017.
However, in recent weeks, articles about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, have been preferred with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: it was once occupied, now the residents have lease contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Interior Senator Henkel had been in favour of a tough police action against the project, which called the area "no-go-zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared on June 22 with 300 police officers, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
In the meantime, construction workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown owners of the house.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers left under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Santa Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a pebble that wanted to get majority police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police between the house-occupied people and their neighbors open up does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the whole of the Mainz road, near the Riga.
While the Mainz had been cleared under a large police service in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are sometimes still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former house occupaners are now sharing their pigeon.
This is also noticeable for the rent, which has increased by almost 60 percent in the case of new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized by the cast-in discs or the freshly painted facades that were thrown with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year, together with the words "left-wing violence."
One reason that not all neighbours consider this a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against police.
Most of the crimes are material damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is disgraceful: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not been in the Riga for a long time.
For the architect studied her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neubauer has deliberately moved to Riga Street - and remained.
That is why it was so important that the residents get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the authority of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of the inhabitants like the new building, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building blocks that the old inhabitants are pushing away.
"In the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting to many of us - they are more likely to live here," she says.
"I cannot accept violence and destruction at all."
But what do you do if no one ever listens to you?
It uses frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For young people who are angry about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the gravel.
Those who come here should be aware of this - just like those who move to a pub area can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact in terms of integration and organisation.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all the actors: refugees, the refugee aid working group, the administration, the authorities and who else is involved.
Reine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the oaring wool milk sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mockery than rather aimed at the variety of tasks required - had meant when the administration wanted to write the job.
An administrative expert has been sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a demanding wool milk sau.
But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle says.
The main focus is on organisation, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network work.
The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.
She has a 50% job for three years.
"It was high time," says the customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and general actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be on the wash road
It is a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must place the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landrat Office to the municipality and the job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work so far, but it depends on private apartments, says Deuschle.
It is therefore necessary to empower common apartments, as it is so nice to say.
So new containers will soon be placed on the wash road.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed residence, they are traineeships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine reports customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work will lead to a positive external impact for the community.
This is "no employment therapy."
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is also where the administration and the volunteers are going.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can easily bridge time, for example with language courses.
If you ever feel like you can't help anyone in Urbach, you can't work and be useless, you'll never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people with nothing to do with." So the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All this was a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some people may call naive." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers are already aware.
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would be completely repudiating them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Reine.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, the main and the voluntary on-the-spot and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already equipped to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.
This is currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: A burglar with a helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - without success.
Two unknown men were forced to enter an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8: 50.
The inhabitant surprised the two of them and set the injustices on the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters in size, probably masked, both were wearing bluejeans and black hooded pullis.
They were running from the city center.
The police used a number of police officers and a police helicopter to get a warrant.
The search went unsuccessfully.
The unknown may have noticed before the action near the apartment or in their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determined after Rocker attack on Imbite
After an attack on an Ulmer snack, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace.
In the case of house searches, evidence and narcotics had been secured, the police reported on Friday.
Some 20 masked men of a rock-like group had, according to the police, thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack in July.
After that, they were supposed to have attacked two guests and hurt one slightly.
Then they fled.
A damage of 10000 euros was caused at the snack and the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, this is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
