Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the central rate. It is estimated that the interest rate reduction would favour the rise in raw materials prices and the slight fall in unemployment to the rise in inflation.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the spotlight: inflation should be "agreed" to exclude the need for action at a later stage.
At 3.3%, the inflation rate reached a record 12-year level in Germany in November, and in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1%.
The increase in inflation in the euro area was the result of an increase in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Locates Government Crisis
After long stagnating, the number of Fidesz sympathisers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
In the case of the party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) support for the MSCP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary barriers to entry: they reach two percent in the population as a whole.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before was the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "pretty bad."
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expecting a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth of the population is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - assessed the work of the Prime Minister as "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% mistrust against the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be controlled even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had been in favour of the government and the head of government, this share was now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only saw the solution in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would "certainly" go to the urns, another 15% would consider their participation to be "likely." In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day fee.
Returning to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budapest trade area continued to maintain the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budapest trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
Since prices in the food markets were "galloped" last December, inflation has not been drastically reduced in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier level of output.
However, it is certainly a deterrent to consumers that what they had paid for in the last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket of goods exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for purebred fillets, nut and poppy rose sharply.
The prices for flour and bread were in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price fall in the product below 200 forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola Pfandbottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year, in the "Napi" sales basket comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206,00 Forint, but the value added tax increase in the prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
This is precisely the process that has affected trade: it seems that the department stores have not been able to decide exactly what price margin they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unforeseeable.
(If the dealer plans the flow rate of a product badly, it may fall by substantial profits in the price margin, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The increase in the "Napi" basket in the last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost by 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was observed, and the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30% in less than 20 months.
(This in turn does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic food, the Statistical Office recorded a more than 30% inflation over the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, as the price level of the product that was already expensive in the previous year, even in the worst case, has not increased by more than 10%.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they could turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are always reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes over the shop tables in pallets.
Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless snakes in all three department stores at the cash register, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saved on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overuse of beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the control of the infections, said the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places are also saved with the disinfectants.
In the trauma department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalised after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomalis Surveillance System from hospitals in 1094, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in the hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by the MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin oxacillin to Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as cervical inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the means are too high or incorrectly used, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic resistant, which are rapidly spreading in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with impaired, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the day-to-day disease.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, told Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable to the control of the emergence or spread of the multiresistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection is found mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospital patients should examine the patients who have been brought in and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not so common.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the State Health Insurance Fund for this investigation.
The majority of cases would therefore not be exposed until the patient had a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
For the European Union, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotics therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological studies are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
Among the outpatient, or in the basic care, microbiological sampling was even more rare, said Karolina Böröcz.
In the case of disinfectants, it is saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred from one patient to another by the care staff.
This is why it is important to wash hands, or to wear gloves and masks, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that really favour the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the agent can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, said Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in control causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment in the government programme has been maintained.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Chief of Death's Police wasn't drunk.
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now returned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest State Attorney's Office on Friday after the official opinion was submitted on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of the police had not consumed alcohol before taking the tax.
The former police chief bowed his own car into the XXII. District of Kossuth Lajos Street and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating fact - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, follow.)
The pedestrian is killed after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned its functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has initiated its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the very beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister for Finance János Veres and Marta Gayecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, with a total value of EUR 400 million, which is intended to cover education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund with grants.
The amount agreed in the loan agreement of EUR 150 million will also be devoted to the budget financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the framework of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting the metro line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an extension of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is looking at the Balkan state that has been rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who is buying in the EU's still cheapest market, but which is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with low-cost ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast," the "sun coast," and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more needed.
According to the estimates of re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the very favourable area of Russia, have more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and so in addition to the summer and winter season also attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in large-scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and the ski areas are mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Geordu Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down, either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good access and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are well written, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group represents business people who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value increase.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a 21% increase in prices per year.
The rise in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the meeting of experts will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the post-2012 emission reduction measures, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol has expired.
A strong debate is currently under way between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GIF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit."
Hungary's six percent
Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's commitment to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), whether the "post-2012 agreement" is successful or not. The Union would even be prepared to support a 30% reduction, if other major developed countries in the world, or developing countries, are also ready to fully and responsibly meet their commitments.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the States that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU had already committed itself to a minus of 8% with its then 15 Member States.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will fulfil, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which the IPCC, the UN's international scientific climate change committee, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has also highlighted in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: special units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos on the network for operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The images with the miniature cameras attached to helmets are checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Usage in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign operations.
Such a kind of propaganda was almost free in comparison to traditional television advertising, so defence expert Gordon Mackenzie said to the BBC, but these videos always have a certain degree of political message, as they confirm in their own way the right to exist the military measures decided by the government.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully worked, censurized recordings, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the maximum of the losses is spoken about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered for themselves.
The Americans, however, are advertising in a slightly different way, that is, with the free-to-download "America's Army" shooting game, in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-saving simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means a cinematic one: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a work conference where her staff can take out the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other enchanting Christmas mood with Tombola or potions in the civil servants' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how power is celebrated.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held in the defence department, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas party of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission party" family members are being held by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
In comparison to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are taking the lead.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola engagement.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4,7 million Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt did not confirm this information because we did not reach the responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there on December 7 instead of a Christmas party.
They did not have to pay any rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the Minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [orito], it was reported that there was no ball dress or suit requirement at the ball.
The Ministries for Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for the Puritani celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organising the celebration for the staff in the four walls of its own for about 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her staff not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the annual sound.
It is expected that about 180 guests - according to the press department - will only be held with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration will be held with 350,000 Forint.
Mr Gordon Bajnai, the self-government minister, and his colleagues, will simply be in the aura of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own festive room, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured at 2,500 forint per head - there is a buffet reception for this money with a subsequent boost.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Vres, the PM's staff have been celebrating this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on the 20th of January, and this time the Ministry's Christmas party is off.
One hundred guests are asked to the castle of Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple aid to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a brief address from the Minister and are turned out with a restrained mess.
As the relevant press stations report on [orito] request, there will be no Christmas party at the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Education.
No information could be provided at the Department of the Environment for the cost of the Christmas.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held in the Museum of Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike that will start on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting will be held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the set-up will begin.
It is expected that there will be strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport will be stopped almost completely, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting will be held, and from Monday, all the organisations that have joined the strike will cease work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to discuss the further action.
The agenda of the National Council on Monday makes it even conceivable that it will only be possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act in the later hours of the evening, or at midnight.
The strikes that are starting on Monday will have to be a major obstacle to transport: the railway companies are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time, and in the morning, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be stopped.
At the same time, there will be many motorway blocks in a direction.
The call for the strike was followed by many trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others plan to set up temporary jobs.
By Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the VDZSZ railway companies on sufficient services, even though more and more people are on the road around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, in the case of the BKV from start of operation to 1: 00, at Budapest Airport between 7: 00 and 9: 00, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are going to lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union for the Democratic Teachers' Union has called for 2 and 2-8 hours, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association is in a state-of-the-art situation at different times, the EDDZ, the Democratic Union of the health and social workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government is withdrawing the draft health insurance reform and presenting a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible professional groups will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDZSZ, which is a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer on the side lines of the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the "risk warning report" of the Institute states that in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "strengthening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this was the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to be aimed at provocation of such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "People in public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "would have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly in recovery, so that since summer 2007 several organisations, called the "national self-defence association," have been established.
"These groups are in common that they define themselves as a civil organisation, while they are openly boasting about preparing their members for, sometimes armed, defence tasks (civil protection, national defence, prevention of order), calling for the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," they said.
And on the other hand, all this is done in accordance with that method, which attempts to taunch various political aspirations based on the political and party defiance of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association therefore do not only serve to circumvent legal barriers that may arise in the course of the registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-raising factor for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultrationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region "- it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the extreme right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the development of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass exusions that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU has taken the events as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection."
In her opinion, in the last 17 years, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - so political capital.
And further, the initiative would have launched a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organising their own protection, it is stated in the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said at the request of the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Each year, risk analysis reports would be published and, should risk-changing trends be visible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case, by the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will give us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, the term "holiday" is different.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Labour-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are days free of work - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
All year round, we have a total of 14 holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the foundation of the state, on May 1, the work will be celebrated, we will remember our dead on November 1 and 2.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for many years been set up in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and facilities are excluded in which the company is continued without interruption, including on public holidays.
The working order will only be confused by the holidays at the end of the year: as of December 24, the life of this country will remain formal, as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will take time, or the special holiday for that.
In the next year, more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be less shifts in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second reopening is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October you will have to finish Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year will, however, be in the mark of the holidays, after everything will be and will remain in place from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" to everyday life at the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconvenience, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That that's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, one regrets it and tries to make it up to you, by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing in a remorse, one would have forgotten to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what can really make your colleagues uncomfortable moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
To borrow something that doesn't belong to a self?
There is little more to it than a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost bullet pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without a question, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any cuverts or post-it in your pocket from the office, because it could hit you yourself: no more, if you really need it.
What about the private life of our colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trach that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's done?
Where and why?
If possible, the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues should not be tied to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a grave, rather than the one who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
You reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report in a sick way by calling for a painful headache, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, intransisible work, projects with fixed dates now have to be done by the colleagues instead of one.
So don't play hard on the colleagues!
If you know the day before, that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted with the absence unexpectedly.
Total, gekicher, telephone
One is now in depth in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the voice of the fellow Members?
Unwanted to hear a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy the colleagues with summs, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), chatter, constant shrinking or nailing.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly in a task (write, plan, organize).
Is it always the other people's fault?
If a project is not completed in due time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important news, one should not look for the guilt of one's own forbearance in others!
If possible, we should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit to your mistakes and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or to make up for the failure, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so much, if it would actually allow the job!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress up in the office - if you wish, also pretty and elegant!
To do it right to all - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the home music scene has not spoiled us with a high-quality electro-pop.
But now you even see the traffic differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yunderboi, so many new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene, is slowly contributing to a change in the overall image, and even when the garagenrock with its guitar-making is "in" again, which proves the local electropop: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he began to take his own way - perhaps because a host house does not tolerate two whistles.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he only managed to get to him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
= = References = = = = External links = =
The formation, which was first performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" was the first album of the year 2002 among the top 50 local albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the almost only one that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead," could open up new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression is the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the - the spirit of time and the trends - the pure guitar, the influences of the rock 'n' roll, are noticed.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who is living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle," introduced himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it the radio player - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been sending from early to late pop music, has successfully set the ear worm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love," which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So you're all right (?).
The hvg.hu has requested from Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: to what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be easy and non-saying, but it can only be produced for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The reception of the listener also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the foreign world, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They are following the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively, because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many do you hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the immature changes of the moment.
But I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We are not really going his way, not to mention that one is always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as a team player who trust in the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us come out of his band and have taken another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that should then hold up as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to put together the choir from the gifted soloists of the home music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized as "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls do it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number was still "needed."
The sequence of chords has formally demanded a voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came to a close and fearfully spontaneous.
I remember, I was pretty electric at the time, but the "Divas" already dared.
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no role, they sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage in the back.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them any solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where to go, let's just let these particular wings, the wings of love, raise us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the case of musical work, there was actually no one, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls," where the groove did not want to work for a longer time, but gradually everything has joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and also now that I have released the album "let go."
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The seed."
Cheating agent risked billions for feeling inferior
Soil-free cheater
The French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka, is named for his former employee Jerome Kerlot.
It came for him by almost EUR 5 billion.
It seems, however, that Kermuch was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and was certainly not unable to do so.
He recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time for the difference to all major banking houses.
"He is more mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as the statements of Kerviel, who published the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had achieved a profit of €1.6 billion with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros, especially in the US crisis.
He had already found the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kermuch didn't believe that and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had blown his profit up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kermuch admits and says that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he's been faking documents so he won't get caught up in it.
He even managed to get his boss to the back of the light, even though the Eureka stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk rofit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought it would satisfy the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk that much?
He had to step up his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
= = References = = = = External links = =
After two years he was an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
But he knew that he would never make as much as others.
"Already at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kermuch explained to the investigation staff.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance he made a lot of money by putting half a billion euros on this title in the London bombing.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, let's let you
"This is like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew about everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I made money, the eyes were closed."
But then at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to make up for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
Suspicious he went through a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A real estate agent who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look him in the cards, "said Kermuch in conclusion.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will be spent on transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract money to innovative enterprises.
This will help companies to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the case of the existing EU funds money acquisition, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful in the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion).
He was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is currently unclear.
According to the chairman of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to let Alemán have his sentence at home or whether to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court showed that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed, which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He was still approved for the current year with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because he had been presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party) and the ČSSD could not therefore refuse him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little-respected, yet very important law in all its rest.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful issue for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The government budgets in the past social-democratic governments have suffered from three weaknesses, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally compulsory, not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure, which the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and, to a certain extent, under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to develop other sources of investment, in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often issued unconsidered bonds, which made them excessive in debt to their city houses.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by the mass sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the State in the course of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, like the rest of the world, the ČSSD is boasting without any hesitation.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete part of the unsensual populist expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the age of retirement and a reform of the pension, then virtually any policy in this country ends and, no matter who is in power, it will remain a mere administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that it will be a ruling politician who will be a civil servant who will mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner in 2008 would be quite unnecessary if former governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it to come to the fact that the ruling politicians are becoming purely administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but that it is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and charges as it is able to wish for peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced government budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will be auctioned to the currency markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, while a further 24 will make it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can provide," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group's consulting company.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unfunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billion losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do this," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and bring the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in the lending of funds between banks.
This means that the banks were always afraid to borrow each other's money, even though the US, Canada and Britain's central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks will help to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to be the most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed his views on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet," he said that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President, when he presented his book, stressed that his subject was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read their attitude unabated.
Klaus reminded us that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was, after all, an academic, able to understand and assess professional practices, had experience of statistics and was also a national economist.
As the main statement of the book, he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore did not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as someone who has experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he considers that to be a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from the present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and return."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
600000 drivers failed the time limit to change their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that the exchange can be requested to allow the authorities to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of the vehicle, the offices of the capital are overloaded with applications, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration makes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced time limit of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 kroner.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange by the end of the year and are leaving without a valid driving licence will be in danger of a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
But the police can also make it use of an admonition in the event of the transgression.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the person who does not drive can also be punished by the community.
It was said that he could be threatened with a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to make a mild effort and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one threatens a thousand kroner sentence.
The driving licence was a document in which anyone could decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a identity card that everyone, and that is a valid identity card, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were united with Berdych
The former police, Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having done the same thing with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its sentence by one and two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged with this matter, but first of all the first-instance judgment is before him.
In other processes, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted any more.
In January, a district court held 19 people guilty, mainly for taking part in robberies, and the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused were in dispute from the very beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, among others, gave information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The prosecution is about the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, for robbery, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also for a presumption of office and illegal possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched by many million kroner through its robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of other courts recognized as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's area have to be responsible for another process, and other cases have not yet come to court.
The main proceedings have so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children in exchange - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a delivery clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask the hospital in Třebíč for 12 million crowns of compensation plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the Velebas proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high a number of times," said Dostál after today's trial.
"However, in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We will see if it has any meaning at all.
We insist, however, that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of people together, "said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation negotiations, which the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
The parents of the children, in the opinion of professionals in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth.
The men were better off in the stress situation, even if they were facing allegations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
The women, on the other hand, are in a worse position to deal with the effects of the dream that has been experienced, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba summarised the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses of the nursing clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina (Bohemian Moravia) handed over 100000 kroner to each family as a substitute for expenditure that had been incurred by the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the administration of the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In the event of doubt, they must reach a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far committed the parties concerned to relatively low amounts of compensation, the amounts were determined by tables and were in the range of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight for the "Kingdom of Walachei."
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachischer König," but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably appeal.
"The argument is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
They all introduced themselves in the words "Walachisches Kingdom" to this particular actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabiš.
"We've had almost ten years of work.
"He said," raising money and the concepts of activities. "
According to him, the cause is a fight for money.
"After years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win the job as a parasitic, "he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachischer König" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not the intention at the time to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of issuing Walachic passports.
From an original fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity were crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walachisches Kingdom."
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered to their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" show for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Walach Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of the parties that were today disbanded lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have started to accumulate, which in the "King of Boleslav I was elected to the St. Nicholas Day."
The lead role was then used as a king's mother by the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka then filed the action against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
The competition prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity in the fight for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn't want to give up details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register in a quiet way, "said Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Swing forward parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not worth much, the quality of the gear, the steering and also the processing could be described as less than average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just have to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of head freedom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Go on
I only go through the interior for a short time to not repeat myself too much.
This is a rather successful design, where I have only objections because of the cumbersome central tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over, where we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side stop has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, the enlarged dimensions of the body can also be felt here.
In the combi the already mentioned lack of head freedom is also removed.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the loading room.
I have to call it (also because of the folding back window) very well-loaded and space-saving.
The hollow rooms are equipped with a hold-urts that are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be separated and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly visible 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading room or the very low loading edge after the rear seats are folded.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, that's what a 1600-Kubik engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and is moving well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be hiding his exhaust with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns in addition to the beech.
However, we had headboard bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper solution, electric window levers in the back and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but you can count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So all that remains is the decision which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not possible
In the UK, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which in the case of the local fears of the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europe has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is an example of the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and reprisals among students have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the boy insulting her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack of two minor girls.
The girls had supposedly made racist comments to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks, "a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the fight with the immigrants from Eastern Europe a survival fight.
The cases mentioned show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported coming here to search for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students therefore visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and stunning cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in a great deal of measure.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or through camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the very end of the 20th century.
It was one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among the
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses were growing, over the wide boulevards were driving cars that were one of the cultural symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats in the salty and moist air have long since fallen apart.
May Havana, in particular his oldest part, have come down strong, nowhere in the area you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned out right now, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism is bringing urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-operated narrow-track trains to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you can see a busy and fully functioning locomotive, whose old people have been in the museum for a long time.
Ageing objectives
The most important places do not leave out the majority of the visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
The only thing to mention is that there is a museum in the already mentioned estate Hemingways, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, the limehills and the rocks, are a steep rise from the valley floor, and in their cave rooms the fertile soil was collected, which also covered the weathered rock areas of dense growing.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the "Major Zeman" series was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her to the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that in the fifties of the last century there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to ensure that it was not taken into account.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of sugar factories."
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, must overcome high and tiled mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern suburb of Cuba, thanks to its untouched nature, was included by UNESCO in its world heritage directory.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it was built about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, is located, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Piglet Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, over all this could be written many pages.
As you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment have an impact on the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan was not in line with its ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have stationed in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Minister of Defence Robert Gates, called on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the population to start developing the economy and security itself, "says the British Minister of Defence Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
They specifically demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously reflect on the concrete objectives for the next time and on the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed the same opinion.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about 90% of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "said De Hoop to the Reuters agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
There is also a dispute among the countries involved over the last few months as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said Gates.
This week, the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers a faulpelze.
"Afghan non-students uncloaked: the Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German paper went on to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
In 2009, government debt will be high on a trillion
Each Czech has a government debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to pay for this year with 159.2 billion kones.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they therefore increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state had to pay more than 111 billion kroner.
"It seems so far that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, the debt was to move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner, "said David Marek, an analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
The same is true of Vladimir Pikora, the next finance analyst: "We could come in the course of 2009 to overrun a trillion.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be prepared to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change, "he said.
Debt growth
The government debt comes from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The public debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic government debt has now increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of public debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how good the economy is.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to take up 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
This is also the maximum amount of funds for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-million-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of public debt securities of 43 billion and the rates for the European Investment Bank's loans of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum and then expulsion.
The British were accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After the parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was taken at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September, when the teacher calls on her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classic eddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports to school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as the first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the image sign My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic Prophet is considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything to get too close to a religious faith, I just regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, in his view it is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion that share the many students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
It is to be remembered that the first name of Muhammad is also the second most common name given in the UK, for which 14 different ways of writing exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of devotion to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion meeting in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, the European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner, Belgrade and Pristina, called for their commitments to maintain peace, and for the talks to continue beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika's mediators, which the European Union, the United States and Russia are bringing together, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the Troika last August from the UN had received the order for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Botswana-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade was part of the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the war of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken alone in the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up the way they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population would be in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them to conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace to which they had agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas, in the end, are seeking a peace treaty to resolve all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians is mainly about: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their home in the 1948 conflict, which is in the present state of Israel.
After the President of the United States, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and that all points should be covered, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to the direct and uninterrupted negotiations of the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations and to his efforts to ensure that they could be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli that exist alongside each other, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has announced that it has received a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all the Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories that had been occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab Prince says in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the DA, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5: 00.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km / h, without blue light, a police spokesman explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without registration, not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, hit at very high speed.
It ramped the left side of the police car after it had disobeyed its lead from the right, a police officer continued to explain.
The alcohol control carried out on the passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (the bulkhead, the split windshield, the cut-off bumper) is a proof of the gravity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she has entrusted the IGPN with an investigation report on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger," in coordination with the main public security department of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that she was excluding the investigation of the IGPN at this stage from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday night, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-scale trad has reached their left-hand side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, some kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrest on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been stuck together until the police managed to slow down.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were born yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly took place that the police would have left the scene of the accident very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would rule out any serious error in this matter as well.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are needed and where one must be very careful.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disrupted police officer who was leaning.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who made the fourth phone call.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be said that the police did not help the young.
The first aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, in turn the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan the tension is increasing
On Monday, the Pakistani police put down the first demonstrations, since two days earlier the emergency was declared by General Musharraf.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades that were used by the regulatory forces there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the Assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the lawyer's movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers to the judges who were against the state of emergency, and to those who took an oath to Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The Chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his office and replaced.
All we represent is illegal, anti-institutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command over the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for emergency, declared on Monday the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to release his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as President ended.
The Vice-Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denounced the persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy leader.
More than one third of the pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Economy Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users using the pill between 20 and 40 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are planned carefully today.
With one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A bold exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space ferry Discovery, a large cylindrical part which is about to record the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 ton module for electricity generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After it had moved it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, the range of which is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be seen as accordion was damaged by a clutch cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space ferry Discovery for a control course and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote arm of the space ferry that was attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best space walkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After checking the damage, he separated the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged site.
He was supported by a second space walker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and made.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded up before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space ferry Discovery to start the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Air and Defence Group has announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to counter the A400M's remains, the EADS share is currently showing a significant drop on the Paris stock market.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's early flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
To remember, the business performance of the EADS has fallen of 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large A380 carrier.
The group originally provided for a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the Urns: the mass of the Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters broadcast on public channels, which, although already recorded, is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite issue during the campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, very transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have turned out to be there.
She denies a campaign of oppressors.
Communist leader Guendadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, for ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer continues to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without any tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will be Putin's successor as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third term in a row.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the omnipotent party United Russia, the government and president will choose?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
It's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goldkov, Director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg is even further down: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christian for five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has rejoined the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, out of their own free will, are renouncing the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What do you think?
This phenomenon concerns all social groups, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understand to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian leaders) are the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think about it for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they redeem?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless it was a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, that is, at the request of a former victim or his family.
The 11 States responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Harmful information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out, in particular through the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health of the forced workers, Reto Masters, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The list of prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and to provide them with any evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent staff are working on tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
It is not to be expected that there will be any fundamental new news in these documents, as Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, had explained in 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission's figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will bring great progress to the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported by India, the European Commissioner continued to say. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion a year and services of EUR 10 billion a year, this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's secondment in New Delhi, said, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet in New Delhi for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about the current recurring concern about the credit conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the concerns that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which will start on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The Bank further states that this will bring about the circulation of £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) on 6 December, at the basic tax rate and only by 10 January.
This seems to be the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This is usually done for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the daily different interest rates of the interbank loan with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate varies from day to day on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been combined with penalty charges that the banks had prevented from using.
According to some rumours, increased by the development of the fund rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the proposals of the PS on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) identified about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were 50% on the employment allowance, the re-introduction of the TIPP flotante, a transport check or the limitation of the rent.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some strong exchange of views between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 to Bilboard.com.
C3 will host the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Melvin Benn Festival, formerly known as the Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned producers of festivals.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts the 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been there, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after it has been successful in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax returns in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the most important ones are on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large," in line with about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator is opposed.
These attempts to relax are one of the delegates' tasks.
A political "sensitive mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denies the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are cheap, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best, "he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment, the first priority is to introduce the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the stock exchange have a final year rally? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the year-end on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in terms of the coming final year rally.
However, the experts are not able to make any safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that the month of December on the stock market usually comes with a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to produce forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong increase in the course of the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which is heavily affected by the upward trend in the assets to be generated.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral trend, which is influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US central bank's interest rate, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increase in the price of crude oil and the risk of the increase in inflation.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agreed that it was a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has lost a value of 4% since its highest mark of 15.945.7 points on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year at this time.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently, especially as a result of the end-year rally that will take place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the day of the bridge on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous market assessment is at a close technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which will soon be dependent on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that they will be positive.
In the selection of the values to drive the Ibex to new maximum, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney is saying that this year the great values are on the line.
The expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sector will go hand in hand.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACP has been on a catching-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert said.
In the last half of the year, market events will determine the increased consumption during the Christmas days.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in the Spanish market in a small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December had only two cases of falling course.
When the technology bubble broke down at the end of 2003, it led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 raised 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and a final year rally will also show up.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first banking group to take the chance to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on a weekly basis and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly referred to the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a final decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement, with 75% of all branches being concluded on Saturdays and opening for this on a day of the week in the afternoon, although not for the customers.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to the business opening hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is exactly the intention that Popular is following with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, because of their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new, but changed, opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time will align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
For example, the extension of the opening hours is connected with a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments but was accompanied by an increase in staff recruitment, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine offices in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
They have come to the agreement with Telefonica for the time being to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecom for the first time doubles its stock market value and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this set, the CEO of Telecom, Paolo Vasile, was satisfied at the end of the market. The station he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, attenuated his joy: that is exactly what has hurt me; not that we have increased growth, but that we have had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecom finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value of 2.193.46 million is half.
The market value of other listed communication companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable, to 3,571 million, to 2,518,53 million for Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) and to 1,779 million for Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, says Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level is uncertain.
One week ago, Telecom declared its intention to become the first television station to win more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues this year, which assured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecom and Publiepaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the station would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the comparison of the better stock market of Telecom is the high payment ratio that the company was able to have until the present time: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecom by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This was the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: As a result of the multiple incentives and the prospering market, Telecom (buy) measures a more favourable position than Antena 3.
3.
JPMorgan: in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate), recommends to reduce expectations in both cases
The Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the requests for additional / amendments to the project, the government published the provisions of the new law, with the aim of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senates, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and to regulate individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Investment Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the Spanish Investment Commission's (CNMV) control rights and the promotion of cooperation between the various European Union control authorities.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialised companies and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), to the advisory companies which are combined with the investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law requires investment companies to inform the priorities of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently provided for further changes, with the decision that the debt securities issued with titles must now be considered as complex financial resources due to their high risk to the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of diplolized economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation, which restricted the fields of work reserved for the economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator who works on a foreign account, does not need the authorisation of the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the purchase of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) increased by five-tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union is the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of the data with US products by the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, while using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the pre-established indicator was only a benchmark and therefore did not have to be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current number is not good, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that in November there were less surprises than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced the forecast published today.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half, after the UK central bank had requested an emergency loan in the middle of September of last year, which is now only £12,000 million (equivalent to €16800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months as a result of the loss of customer confidence, and even despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money would be safe to continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must bring in about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of the plants in the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his remarkable advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow the annual flow of £50,000 (approximately €70 million) into advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of the development of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Partido Popular, and at that time a chairman of the town council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire driver of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's place of residence on the basis of important incriminating documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information have been reported from the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At the moment, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will therefore lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory by the Socialists, will take over the office of President of the Congress.
In the press conference, José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it, after a meeting with Zapatero was held today in the party's headquarters.
In the view of the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the forthcoming elections, the politician from the Mancha would seem to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as the President of the Congress, who had announced last November that he would no longer take up his career in public policy in the next general elections, instead of working in the university area for climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had been constantly pushing for his return to the political process.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deny the citizens who would take over the position of President of the Congress in the event of an election, and called this an act of transparency.
If he is actually to take over the office, he hopes to turn the board into a house of respect, not of insult or of the circle, so that it will always appear to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, you get the impression that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk in peace and quiet is Congress, so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he would not seem to have taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
As the climate debate is both the skeptics of climate change and those who are in the forefront of a social and political debate on this issue, it is an unmerciful criticism that the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal does not explain the action or non-action of its government, which has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of the countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-compliance, which sectors are the result of this, and why did his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has planned to take to combat climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of the citizens, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences it will have.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be used against climate change in real terms are not popular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE-proposed petrol-cent seemed to be so strategically dangerous that he was forced to take the proposal back.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty words without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise appropriate politician for election campaigns does not have to speak, to sue, to demand, but instead to pursue the demanding issue, to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not mean that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future, or we can only refresh with one compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were taken into custody because of the alleged suspicion of city-building violations, it was known today from the investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and the local construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the already last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it was found that more than 2 million hectares of untapped building land should be redesigned for urban development projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration was given illegal commissions to it during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested were brought to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP member Juan Morales are also being investigated.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, who lives in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmoniar Pablo José M.G., whose company is a part of the Nuaria group and is to have received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the local authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, which was supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia village, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specialising in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name for other names with the appropriate skills.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are welcome to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which takes a position on the note published in the same newspaper on 18 November; by chance on that day, whose issue included the criticism of the book of Blackburn.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturist who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
The Chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, in an interview of the daily Helsinki Sanomat, called on teachers to take a more critical position in relation to Plato and proposed to remove the teaching of Plato from the sublevel curricula for the Faculty of Philosophy at Gymnasia.

A colleague informed about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of the law, which was in prison for six months.
But if you are robbing a music business at a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a crime, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To take part in a rebellious dispute, a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) is a consequence, while the data exchange results in a six-month imprisonment of up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorisation of which has not been made by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has done a lot of digging up his demands.

My house doctor is giving me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings of the monthly pay are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared by a tomography-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research centre Life & Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and, on the other hand, his partner failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure that it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been protesting for eight years for the crimes of the Balkan wars. Her headquarters are in the prosecution of the former Yugoslavia's criminal court, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - are the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Her names are on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, is tracking the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her project to track down the missing criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments to narrow their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance scheme, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which once again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of the settlement in the event of an injury.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, time of production of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall set their prices according to the statistics, so that, in the event of a higher risk of accident, higher contribution payments are also due.
For this reason, both over 25 years old and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also in the company's conviction, tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefits of the vehicle are affected by the frequency of the driving and therefore the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation in detail in order to select the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points to be considered in the selection of insurance in order to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25-year-olds meet many obstacles in the choice of low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it was best for an ideal insurance scheme to complete a full-scale insurance scheme, there are still more expensive alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a full-scale casco with self-participation, so that the services of a full-scale insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount of the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, says Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures the customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty shall include an increase in the rates in question.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. This is the reason for the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate is falling.
It is therefore most appropriate to opt for full-time insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish manager of the European company explains, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full-time insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full-scale insurance with self-participation (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which only takes place for the third year of the vehicle.
They are more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to start a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is appropriate to provide full-time insurance with self-participation (with an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance that only uses in the case of a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it must be noted that car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection that is in line with our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow in Milan hopes for the eighth final
The Milan FC and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point in San Siro next Tuesday in order to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter will decide to participate in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with an indecision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the Milan FC will have to take part in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will be the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th and the 16th.
For example, this group will be completed before all others and the indecision in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home to the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be the first group in the event of a victory and would therefore have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be a defeat to qualify for a club of Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milan countries will try to rent the evening to the Scots. They hope to reach for the second time in a row the eighth final of the redesigned championship league, after they were defeated in the first season in the same round by a goal of Kaka in the replay period (1-0) and by a zero to zero indecision on the game.
While the club is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth and the membership of the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, could win the third place through a victory and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the first shot for their first tour in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators after the band's dissolution in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) y "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell), just before the start of their concert at the GM de Vancouver Stadium, declared that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people could see the concert at the sold out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which had taken care of Furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which is published in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing gold bracelets on stage, which had been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham made it clear that the British star did not get our wardrobe on the face once, and that's why I'm very excited about what he's going to think of the show.
Sporty Spice, whose resignation from the group in 1998, due to internal differences of opinion, led to the resolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said that it was about the separation of the band she had led nine years ago.
The singer also made it clear that the disputes have been resolved and that they are all very much in love with each other.
However, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the TV station CTV, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
On her arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be next in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on the 23rd of December.
New fears about the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports from fuel to Western Europe being affected.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia for higher transit charges.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important guest transit states in talks," said the Minister for the Economy of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments about the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-criminal registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together in June with the attack on the Glasgow airport.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in the Old Bailey, and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the employment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check pre-trial registers, the Agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the main auditor now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board of Directors should take up guidelines for the exclusion of criminal records that help employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been routinely carried out." the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation directives with a high degree of detail before the employment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that prior to the deployment of potential NHS staff, investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-appointment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were left for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to find that established control procedures were largely observed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was concerned to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the control studies in the run-up to the employment of all employees, including those from abroad, are reflected in the publication of which is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
The award was also awarded to main actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, the director Anton Corbijn, and co-actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the best lead actress for the thriller notes on a scandal.
And Bond-actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film to the world public.
The prices were given in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on which the soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just £3 million.
However, he has presented two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most known for the delicious cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The award for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia in David Cronenberg in London playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to get the prize, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored. "
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nithy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on the spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaida sympathisers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 strong rapid response group to protect plants after a failed Al Qaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a domestic declaration, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "rocket expert" who was illegally entering the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, a further 22 of the prisoners were planning to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned the clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are seeking Iraq to join Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners of the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader born in Saudi Arabia to target the prowestern Saudi government - are looking for foreign housing, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior informed state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims that are branded as infidels and renegates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a distraught twin of the Earth than it has been known so far.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour to the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary pathways, but the Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, on Venus, conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, believe scientists today.
But due to the unflinched carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, which has examined the plants for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago, like the Earth, possibly with a living environment."
"enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reported enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
All still open
Mitt Romeo said he didn't think it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the Presidency to face a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the Republican Party that is going to enter the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with the selected YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single subject, immigration was at the centre of the debate.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a electoral disc when they heard things that they liked: the TV station noticed the points of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the call that he was a good deal in terms of illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly concerned when the question asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to follow up on this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both of them are in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration gap sooner and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: stronger borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible was his preferred book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabe's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation and his incidental storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate from the beginning united the party with a victorious message about the size of America and a blink on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No nobles seem to have been sold, no politician of Paris's hotel bills paid, no out-of-marriage toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) in the British Labour Party for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without which the controversial Gordon Brown would have been good.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the demand for a election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean has developed.
The unwise rescue of Northern Rock, a banked bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under fire.
Bad-thought proposals to change tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house of protest against military spending cuts: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary-General (and her former head of performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is going irrevocably to resign.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it does not even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to get lewd; the Cabinet Ministers are beginning to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and ungodly.
In this way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misconduct - as in the long "money for nobles" study of political party financing - the voters may assume it was him.
Still, Browns' situation is not as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely tormented.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new attitude to political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will obviously have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusion, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by taking a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to make the measure full, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find something permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and to move forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party friend like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indisputable justice and solid competence.
Card shark
Is the credit crisis in America's credit card market starting?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that back fins are swirling excited.
Now that America's real estate market is at risk, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection is spread from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the rates of withdrawals and the rates of saumnicism, which measure the share of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
Last month, HSBC announced that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and sawdust are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third quarter column rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the keditcard losses; the number of applications (and thus the amount of the column fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers are deteriorating or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debt, now that home credit is drying out.
However, card exhibitors look at the flow of money instead of capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even benefit the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We will not wake up one day and completely reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial representative.
Even if a sudden cover-up crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British benkers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, turned their requests into guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally argued innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set for January.
But during a hearing in court before US district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the United Kingdom in the course of extradition, which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation that was launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations that Fastow had originally filed against them in 2002 pointed out that he was the objective of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to lift a fraudulent conspiracy with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron activities that helped to get the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it had in fact a significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow was wrong to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others had some 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow declared guilty of conspiracy in two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Plite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year-old prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a three-year and a month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose because of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of book-keeping tricks could no longer conceal the billions' debt or make weaker businesses look profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became null and void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's a change for some of the rich Russians.
"There is room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, which was held in a severed exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly made Russians in everything, from mahogany-shaped yachts to diamond-covered car grills, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas at its gloss times.
"We went through the same phase in the 189s, when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialist," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflies of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the world's most visible free-for-money exhibitors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold exchange.
In Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted ideas on how to sell high-price goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private capital in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a body of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum level of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-being and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a Red Carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the neural, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the congestion for several hours to visit a subdued warehouse, which, without a doubt, put together Cadillac Escalades, pocket knife made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-track logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that would not market in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here said he sold two 70,000 dollars of mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that issued high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements that he would have sold three car-cooling grille for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same combined chain bracelets, for each $5,000.
He showed a reporter a car tyre that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-substitute.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which had been filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire knife.
Passers stopped to throw the money around, cell phone photos, while in the middle of the spare empire they sit back, get friends to blink, or just to put a few million in.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Pouted operation suspected in the case of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving ceremony when Ronald Livingston saw here through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healhere restaurant and watched an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stop two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical coroner coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead wife Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a trial carried out by an unapproved, cosmetic surgeon who the police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet established what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological studies whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a lawyer for the State Attorney of Union County, Theodore J. Romankov, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3: 00 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Mrs Castro was being questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a sweet rose shrub is in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian is barking behind the house.
A blue barrel marked with "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hung by hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him to find a way to live in the provincial and hard political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates lead to the increase in world trade markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate reductions, were reinforced by disgraceful comments from the vice-president of the US central bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the central bank, said that the policy must "respond flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down trivial markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October."
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and to stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate reductions.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, in the face of other bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S & P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Prior to that, the return of credit pressure to the markets had been underlined, after strong demand for an auction of the European Central Bank's three-month guarantee funds granted to the European Trade Banks had been granted a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed further capital into the money markets in London increased when the credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks by 6.59 percent to their peak since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, is here on call at least under this special title to help the head coach Peter Moors and the captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which in part time.
Whoever does not get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is no doubt.
It is never easy to get exactly fixed, which allows a person to reach the top of his professional career, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest level, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to go up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great impact on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, when James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind boils into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points of shine and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still fighting to consolidate, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moors will follow their conservative instincts and gut feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion in the course of today's network meeting at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned-on balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beating that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the alleskun from Essex has a lot of joy in life.
He is not impressed by anything on a kicketplatz and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently taken over a four-wheel vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had seen it from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he boils his middle rate with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be good, if, as the teaspoon from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels that they had expelled from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people, "he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shitian teacher from the main Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, has helped to drive Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sheikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sheikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
This is why I have returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US force increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens," who were armed and, in cooperation with the American military, defend their neighbourhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and the use of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will regenerate sectarian tensions and conflicts will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest country is the leading country in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I said for the 50th time yesterday to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan, the smallest country, self-styled on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in place five in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
For example, the universities are already working closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
As a result, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But the children of the country also bring the Saarland to higher education - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the Federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively much developed.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineers has fallen by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education in the Netherlands has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we have launched a number of reforms in general education schools," says a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced national comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that has now also been copied by other German states.
If the performance of the students is to be improved in a sustainable way, it will only be possible to show future comparative studies.
In Pisa, 2003, the proportion of risk students fell from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavaria count better.
And to the detriment of the Saarland, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise point.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory at high school - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez converts the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have the time meters in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to a new law, as the Official Journal of Venezuela reported, the watches are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US enemy Chávez founded its decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones for full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time), Chávez announced the end of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The Left Nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to remove Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which concerned the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" Venezuela's decision, had criticised Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is in all its mouths.
A new phone ringtone in the country provides for Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He spoke to the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who had been annoyed at the recent Iberoamerican summit by the constant calls of the left-hand populist and who had been driving over his mouth.
Germans are at risk of wage reduction in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to be at risk of a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Foundation, the employees could expect in real terms less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is the fault of the modest wage developments, the increase in value added tax and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" -Zeitung.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the time of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to have to ask the Federal Government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion for food and petroleum products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
The total prices increased by 3.0% in the year-on-year comparison.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its anti-life-like atmosphere of the earth, Venus Express has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind-swirls on the Poles, as it also occurs on the earth in the winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proved it - it has detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "primordial" theory, lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, it sometimes has temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no probe has been on the way to research this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, do not in the view of the researchers, only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa reports.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 km.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, is about the sun in just under 225 days.
But it is much more slowly turning around itself: a Venuday takes 243 days of the earth.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water that remained on the earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbon rocks, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly he criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balance sheets in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel was protecting Merkel from the accusation that it was in the hands of a new China policy.
"The German Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown indignation about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, had complained of the Union's "showcase policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's leader Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lamas reception as a mistake.
China rejects the fact that European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in an official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lamas' actions and words showed that he was trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other current provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against a claw like in France
Road battles with the police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots as in France.
The Federal Minister of the Interior called for everything to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unravel in violence on the road.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth ramps in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that we do not also build up and unload social explosives.
We have to take this seriously, "he said to the" New Press "published in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This was not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamist conference, this is already the first success."
However, it was too early to be warned.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people in the past nights had been fighting heavy street battles with the police.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
However, greater efforts to integrate the German government called for the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the claw in France, Kolat warned of "imitating effects."
The situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there was a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "above average."
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place."
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
It was necessary to "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly."
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning dumpsters and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has provided rest.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary to announce the Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
In the night of Tuesday, some 80 police officers were injured at the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight, the unrest took place on Toulouse.
The Kravalle was infected by a traffic accident in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The firm's reality-far appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that nothing can be expected of itself.
What country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her uncomforting appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was worry and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that it finally had to rule.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with a very high-profile sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a deposed politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays in the dark there.
For example, climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate objectives are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty the CDU head would have failed two years ago.
She now clings to the fact that the upturn is coming to the people.
This will damage her image as a pragmatism that solves problems instead of talking the world in a beautiful way.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a randal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low-paid?
She's got a few extra sets left for that.
It is important to note how many times it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
Three approaches need Merkel there to bring out a half-straight set.
She stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are having a hard break - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unravelling on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney denies his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
In turn, he contends with serious allegations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegal," replied Giuliani and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The self-turned 30-second videos that Internet users have sent over YouTube are hardly any more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain denies his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq in the round.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method that simulates earth drinks as torture.
However, the main issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates, and the reactions of the Saal public in St. Petersburg in Floridas show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause is expressed in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, and in front of the base and the television audience, I asked him to be one of the anti-abortion supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to grips when he is asked to interpret the Bible in a literal way.
Musharraf first governs in civil
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five years.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as chief of the army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus turned his back on international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now governs for the first time as the civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the exceptional state that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
As soon as he is sworn, according to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will remove the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with it in early November following the imposition of the exceptional condition, had rejected last week all objections to the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is playing again: the three band members of Harmonia reperformed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The enduring sensation then occurs in the form of three set men at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the flower-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to be a big problem for the gentlemen themselves.
The music of the band Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What one can reveal here: Targeted questions showed that the name, although it was swirled by the collective pop memory, was not so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
In particular, what misleading Krautrock means is that in England and America there was always more to it than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can, it was seen in the room in asking German poopsichter.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New! in the Laudatio, the wonder knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later appeared on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the stranger is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the much promising name Cluster.
They first played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had just helped out at the power plant and then as a guitarist at New!, the then perhaps the most radical German group, has a reputation.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as a city-fleeing community.
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to tease as a nanny.
More like being a spiteful artist.
It is also known that there was a leash of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe."
For so let and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material need.
The collection of rice did not only serve the purpose of self-development.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-setting of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unmoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it was ever Harmonia.
The Greek live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The Grönland record company has set itself the goal of nurturing the Krautrock as an original German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Public subsidies, in the context of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
The whole range of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music would be defined.
The space of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The sentence by Brian Eno floats with the most strange sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farm.
The legend is used for projections of other black and white photos of wirr-wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
Not anymore, by sticking microphones to the organ and to the percussion in order to unravel the instruments over self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical depth of the tuftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenster, under sound clouds, coughing and weaving and singing in a beautiful place with the stage "Aaaaaaaah!."
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music universities (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Those who call here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmony cannot be taken from it now.
The most obvious thing on the stage is to be thoroughly reconsidered.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can give you the nerve to rob or to give you a great deal of good luck for a few moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace," two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and banners or they are too stirring.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help that.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia-war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, because too many nice-unimportant roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have shown you the desire to look at it.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunted" (why do film titles have to be as long and inverse as local collective agreements?).
He provides a wonderfully compelling presentation: in fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made of gere if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has had his very best times for a long time, but who, even as a ruby-like monument of his decline, has still preserved considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murderous Peace," which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films continues.
With "murderous peace" one can make a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a serbin from Kosovarian rear-guards, on which one is soon in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film is losing itself too quickly in the form of banners and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be found in a very exemplary way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who are opening up to track down the Serbian superwar criminal "the fox," could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and screenwriter (both in the staff union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go to the forest to do something that the military can't do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the descended cynical with heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also create a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian who was later murdered.
"The Hunting Party" is finally going down the stream when the reporters within the last five minutes of the time-lapse procedure succeed in what NATO, CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and to leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that we want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to walk around, and he suspects the Americans and the French (for example, they are supposed to agree here) not to conduct the persecution too intensely because of secret political agreements.
But the good word and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "I see with compassion the swollen forehead, indicating how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have just the same kind of weak heads, which, however, indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
It has recently been reported in this newspaper that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood's great flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always, when a star drives around the world's crisis or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all the conflicts are still too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's list."
Some film will probably still be mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated in a single way as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, also just too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robbs the screenwriters of the insanity that it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great dictator" have finally become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you should have the sarcastic distance of the artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he answered: "This is because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war will always rule in Yugoslavia. "
From Beust harvested criticism for Olympia cancellation
The abrogation of the mayor of the application for the Olympic Summer Games in Hamburg has been strongly criticised by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism calls for the assessment of opportunities.
On Wednesday, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a renunciation as "not good for the economic location."
No other project has recently developed as large a motivational force in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the sport policy momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed time beam."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic bitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic League," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the winter games in 2018, which was expected at the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have been thinking of until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamt for all time, said of Beast.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This would give the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
In addition, a waiver of the application is contrary to the statement of the Head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German Association of Higher Education.
There, von Beust referred to the application of Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD civil society group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grass bread has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put on the map Olympia and excluded the housing," said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for integrated planning for the small Grasbrook for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU had unilaterally set the "event factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed in Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
He who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box is thinking of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wood boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the 90 Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" listed there are forgeries.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a good conclusion: the six "Brillo boxes" which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably the majority of the other hundred Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" which are in the international art market.
The history is entangled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes," painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paper cartons of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo Carton Factory.
These were not works of art, but their examples, just exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to produce a few glasses of wood in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses are now talking about about about fifteen boxes, which at that time have rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes called "Type Stockholm."
Some of them have achieved more than $100 000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes were produced and issued in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, it was not until 1990 that Hulténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head conservatory at Moderna Museet, has also studied three of the Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and milled, then white oil was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the color was applied directly to the press plate with a painting roll without a foundation - and it is not about oil, but about acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibition material."
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "serious accusations" that are made in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But ever since then, it has been kept in an inexorable silence.
Rebelliating soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have given up, who were in a hotel in Manila, and who had called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trilanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-controlled soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup trial in 2003 - among them Trilanes.
He used the trial to suddenly drop off with about 30 sympathisers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had obviously passed to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government forces blocked the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trilanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units were about to join the march.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
After almost 24 hours, the uprising failed to join the army.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at coup against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

However, the two companies kept all the options open, in particular to further increase the participation in Freenet AG, they said.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
