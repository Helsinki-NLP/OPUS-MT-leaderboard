Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington is critical of the continuing construction of Israel's settlement and is accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal about the Iranian nuclear program, which Obama has put forward, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu had given a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor says he shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was written on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." According to the authorities, this was in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who was teaching in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school area, where the police told him he had a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, shot and killed at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency call one day after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police encamped him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people," with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the back of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
In 2009, Lamb started his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lambs' long-time friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm back then.
All the girls melted there when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house that is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had stayed friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.
They later played one gig or another together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes a entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a slightly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night the last time in the night 5 September after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonisation game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up, and we were kidding.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
On Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community, took part in a candlelight memorial.
= = Early life = = Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt, also took part in the Mahnwachet, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentiss, although he was called his wife, there is no evidence that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less labour for the Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country. In the Christmas period 2014, 45,000 more workers were recruited.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with application calls and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great time for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were waiting in the theater for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I am beginning to realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had a premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "undisputed the biggest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join forces and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the response to the crisis in Syria as they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some tried to mark him as a flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks in surveys down, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit range, and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, of which no one won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's endurance and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of ten say they're "upset" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent saying the same about Trump).
The next one in the field of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters who tend to be the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, said ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their canonies, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a survey of CNN / ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it is shown that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey by Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is gaining the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kaich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A close majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their mind.
A new survey by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given up their voices.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they'd leave the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his campaign speech two months ago, called immigrants from Mexico "rapists," immigration was a turning point in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they match Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to do so too.
The frustration about the government is climbing to new levels.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC / Post Monday survey that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish annoyed."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street a square meter of a Reetdachhaus costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"In Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," it is said in the study - that is, the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most expensive.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student's shop in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential areas, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters in swirling heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, well-known.
Well, well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of this, for example.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goalscooters in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a earned 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their first game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52. / 90. + 2) and Götze's hit (39.) earned 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth starter success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the pendulum to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, Müller received friendly help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a flank-thought shot of the world's master pass.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich people kept word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shinning.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the Royal Class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1: 3).
But the Bavaria, undefeated in seven Eurotacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went bravely, but often too unimaginable to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift to the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left torque.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos-Stürmer Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct removal, the goalkeeper Roberto parted with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria used to raise their dominant game, Piraeus was able to set a needle stick.
On the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, he was left.
For example, when he pulled a shot of ideye over the latte (56.).
Before new, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, sat out first.
The World Cup hero gave green light only after the final training, said sports board Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already evil."
At the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the defeated Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by 11 meters Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawalle at the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly suspected Bavarian fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went against the Munich followers with batches.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke are not only harmful to the lungs, but also to the teeth - this suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news is that if you leave, the risk will fall quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was up by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE stresses.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gums in smokers.
It was not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, study head Heiner Boeing of the DIfE said: "Smoking shortens life."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and according to our knowledge also leads to good dental health up to the high age.
In Germany, over 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies had already indicated that smoking would increase the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter the remains of the late antiquity on the banks of Cologne
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called land monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist in archaeological land-use care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that a fortress was located in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has disappeared, the Federal Police are asking the people for help.
On the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 am the woman crossed the tracks from the station building, coming at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the federal police, she was carrying the most serious injuries.
She was taken to a hospital on the spot and brought to the hospital by the rescue forces.
There is no evidence of the reason for the night crossing of the young woman's track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
The question arises of residents or passers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be given under 24 hours and free hotline to the Federal Police under telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police service.
Commission proposes new court in dispute about TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private conciliation bodies for disputes between groups and States should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which is much more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the Commissioner responsible, Cecilia Malmström.
The Swedish plans to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it has its own information that it wants to work towards an international investment court.
For example, there could be a solution to disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), in particular required by large groups, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can pay compensation to taxpayers, lift national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Compact identified the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German State Secretary, Matthias Machang (SPD), described the plans as a great step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts was off the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Association warned that too many new rules would limit the economic situation.
It was said that this could be a disadvantage for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be set at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicater Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens' lecture.
He tells on the basis of different places, which he keeps recording on the map, about which his minusiously and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they were born and what it looks like, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," well-composed songs appear, which can work harmoniously very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but at any time in the great opulent drifting.
The rumor is that "Michigan" is the first part of a related series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is in a positive position to break certain expectations.
This is where Stevens appears.
He has a live guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a large-scale masterpiece is published in 2005.
Surrounded by ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American billboard charts and does not miss an annual list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic replacements.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but is carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
The stage shows will be the colorful spectacle of Neon-forehead bands and large fluorescent stage deco.
At present, Sufjan is touring Stevens as part of a five-headed band through Germany.
More in the dark-kept hamburger!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the well-mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
You can hear from the audience: the lecture is "more opulter" and you can throw the "record away."
It is only for an addition that Stevens gives a modest thanks, acoustically plays few older songs and finally boils down under a booming applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut is expected to be in a very exciting position at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions that have been asked shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the local Labour Members.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it will be a member of the shadow cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman to remain in silence during a commemorative ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during the singing of the National Anthem has provoked criticism of a number of Tory Mps and is at the heart of several title-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he was "in respectful silence" and he recognised the "Royal Air Force's heroism in the air battle around England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, and they are calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within the labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour submitted changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
A few hours later, Mr Smith said that the shadow labour and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman to be facing David Cameron, since he was the Tory Chief, over the last decade over the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised another political approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will not be able to do so, and that he will not be able to fight with disagreements, and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also talked about the idea that other colleagues sometimes took the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercov, the lower house's spokesperson, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics of a "Kasperle Theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
As it was first sent on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his fellow Members, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and need for far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg ': homeless young people trained to be photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn the living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose as a result of data showing an increase in the UK's wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the United Kingdom's earnings without bonuses grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most recent estimates of the date of an increase in interest rates since 2009.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offer of the rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that it had taken $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decrease after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company rating to "sell."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could affect the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megatar.
Lupian 21 years young, a hammock with a high-end hair.
The guy with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More or less.
At present, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going crazy.
Like Wictoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber construction: This is where your Idol, whose posters are hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm filling her with a dream."
Compulsory school?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the superbowl's advertising break, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimp company washed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also casses.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're surprised at the window.
He's supposed to have bought more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not interest the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato-toner idea
Potatoes or sounders?
It goes both ways - in the potato-toner, which the Oldenburger Imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Potato instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner," which he had just happened to see on TV.
Since then, in his shop, a barbeque is spinning, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been accepted by the Lebanese by the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to betray how much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the world is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches the ground-level campaign to combat aldi-
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a ground-based campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like ice-cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners selling cheap tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment implements its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after the opening of his first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on the high fixed cost basis of Metcash could cost about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the Eastern States, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board of directors contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating debt reduction while at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private-label food.
Metcash's main executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and loading recovery programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collaterals" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, in the opinion of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly called "special Ks," was the result of the infamous conflict between the two of us with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, and Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen beating up a tennis bat after a cramping a potential US open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
"One thing I'm pretty much enraged about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little involved in the fight," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost to the US Open because of a seizure, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he's been doing extremely well in the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he is trained hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take account of the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he guarantees the man from Canberra as a long-term fixed part of the team. "
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He goes up in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, stops refugees
Hungary explained the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown time and built tents and settled there.
But frustration increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants "opened the border!" and cried insults against the Hungarian police.
Some of them rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There will have to be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that the EU countries would take on another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not set its hopes for an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions, which took place on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Ssijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire room along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the coming are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovacs's government speaker in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree on the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of fixing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Rozke, Hungary, when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to get in there.
About 20 were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the President's Office, receives support of 15% of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more constant in their election than the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton has a big lead in women and moderate, but these have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only down here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 percent would only support them because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited by her.
The views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and the selectivity are also quoted.
As the Vice-President is throwing a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57% of the democratic voters of the preliminary elections want to see him in the race - although a third believe that he should not do it.
When democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election, but this number of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "most selectable" has increased.
However, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters are asking questions about the selectivity.
Like last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters is being considered unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important features for voters of their party's pre-election.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best cut off by the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not agree with him.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as Foreign Minister, most of the democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters in the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in the lead.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority view Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close to Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is located close to Donald Trump in the latest survey of CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing weight.
Republican voters continue to support trump in large numbers across the country. The support is growing by 27% in the Tuesday survey of 23% in the last CBS survey that was conducted before Fox News debate last month.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump among Republican voters with higher education exceeds.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kaich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - it lands at 19% support from the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising last week, Trump found some sidelines for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find still warm water for the swimming pool.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: up to 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German weather service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, the Mediterranean still offers bathing temperatures: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a skilful ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
In September 2013, members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death.
Officials said he was loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with his eyes tied, and he was repeatedly attacked, trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and were supposed to wait an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, torso and thigh with blunt force.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has been dying every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family in an explanation.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with the harassment of attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also take it to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases the interest
A rise in interest rates will come, and the house will be lost, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will lead to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to a rise in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, head economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights, but still to a low level, to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a view based on historical trends of how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest rates increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to degenerate income 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - towards the increase in interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, head of plant-stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on the shares starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote increases in interest rates.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that were not in place before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the case of an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates on such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been committed to an increase in the Fed's interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, Futures trade only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study, all the growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and have put pre-recession levels in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer convergence of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flare of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones thinks that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from this when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse, as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher revenues, even if experts are of different opinion on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "stupidity"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it does something that the private stations do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem to like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to face the commercial rivals.
The Tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own house" when it started a series of entertainment the next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money to the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased most slowly in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the UK's main shopping roads have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000, with only five percent increase on the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He said that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is collapsing, and we may be experiencing a reduction in growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers was five times around their computers to make their bargain, and some of the dealers' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers were fighting for bargain, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £issues a little more than 1 £was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made via web-shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion decks in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims by the streets at the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia places a burden on the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell into Mecca's great mosque.
Married, largely dressed in white, filled the route to enjoy its respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moarenem-Graveyard.
The mourning procession passed on at the Holy Site, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi King imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 best men who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane went down.
Mr. Akram and his parents were in the Great Mosque before the beginning of the annual hadsch.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Hajj will continue to go to Mecca with thousands that will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, the Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddish, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is led by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abrupt son who was abducted by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been increasing
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores that aim for craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British are laying down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their home,
If you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls to be sent, you seem to be a minority today.
Because British increasingly employ craftsmen to do home-work jobs in their homes, according to the company's head behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, the new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been overhauled.
Therefore Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 B & Q sales points.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten buy decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men are outnumbered by the employees.
She said that it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our stores.
We must move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a UK leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a fall in half-year profit and turnover after the group owed the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, King Fisher, who has Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich / Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Klagenfurt State Court, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich / Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The accused did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of authority.
He was finally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendant had crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used funds from association accounts, through which they were allowed to dispense in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at about 400,000 euros.
The sports staff are also charged with financial offences.
This was the fact that the Chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, resigned.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense explained that the association had not at any time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports staff would have only charged expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 Schilling (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At the time we were in the situation: do we continue or close the club?," said one of the accused, in the bread profession's large-scale auditor of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-defendant he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We made money, we put our life insurance in the bank as security," he said at the hearing.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
In addition, in the event of the corresponding financial success, the payment of the expenses compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expenses compensation was paid only years later, that is, from 2003, when an increase was in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits appeared, the former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial statement that it was only important to have freedom of debt, said the answer.
When an official investigation on abuse began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The interrogator had no answer to that for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation."
Why damage?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree to this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "With him, you're all off the hook."
"Am I a legal representative?," he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had calculated only mileage and diets.
He had charged the club a thousand euros per month for diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were not able to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an operating test in which everything was considered correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received the kilometer money.
All the transfers had been made in cash, and he had to go to the bank from his place of residence to the international market, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard has another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The position of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group is planning to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer sector.
This would save $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will come from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed about 302,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14.
The hewlett-Packard share was down 2.3 percent in the post-market.
The company, which was created with printers from the California Palo Alto, is currently split up: for example, the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company today - separate from the more future-friendly areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from company customers for its services were the last to increase the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter of July, the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This reduced the revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split-up and massive job relocations to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only been late in responding to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans overall provide for the reduction of some 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: majority support for the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in the fight in Iraq would be largely negative: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are against intervention in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed to 51 percent of the respondents, and 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent couldn't decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-propelled cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility combines" on Thursday.
The general audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water launchers on the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred applied refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He said on the phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
There was a police line formed and a launcher was ready behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials used pepperspray in the first place.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was then dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while, waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees fell in love with themselves and suffered from a lack of breath.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
The world is watching when the US central bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who still felt that the Fed would do this last week, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep the interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, while trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adapt to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
Slayer of death at Delta State University left a letter of apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" in the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff at the emergency center that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but that "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it go away.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good person."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been meeting with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University, as his life's lair on the university's website indicates.
Stars that have lost their fortune
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to be fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all of this will take his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the around 1000 managers in the world will cost the company a job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa rebuilds its company structure and evaluates the low-cost daughter Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation was to contribute around EUR 500 million a year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline informed on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team around Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the new version, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 company's staff has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations will be resumed after the court-closed strike on this Thursday.
That's what the union told me.
The discussion will be the subject of the pilot retirement scheme.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in one year with a forecast record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the "Wings" concept is the background.
It provides that Lufthansa will be able to outsource Eurowings to the group's own cheap line in the fight against competitors' routes.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He's being moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery is now starting, I come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the English defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like it had touched him [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
When talking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a fouling game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It is one thing that all parents will learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fable published by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All fine and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead shows a content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the masked city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but who died completely unknown.
As if this was not yet suspicious enough: Cameron's text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "In the masked city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, hopes to win."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book's action. Here, an unnamed boy, as the local environment is ravaged by the money-rich, trees-falling, Thneed-knitting once-ler, despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a hocking, curly-beards being, "who speaks in the name of the trees," hears.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outside victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
This is the message that Adam Lyth is leaving the England test box and being replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me to analyse as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best choice.
A long time ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own fate.
If he's going to put out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play home and outside.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I'm high on.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him, but this depends, of course, on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quick ones, showed up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a drummer can't beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before performing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup Spinners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the training team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Battsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experiences, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahara, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team designers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain access if the economy is in a flute by 2017
David Cameron's untapped renegotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU is getting more into trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who was violently disputing because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, are tired of Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes in the Treaty that they do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it did not like it either if it was at risk of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a United Kingdom looking outside in the EU's tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's carefully-minded Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the over-long-standing people like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain has a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will get a leg out of it to help the Selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, but they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as a "EU-straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo of non-residents, who own most of our great newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about her, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had set the principle of the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I would like to express it - is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional inflorescend trend and the wilder entrails of Tory's little Englishness can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said, "A Benn, but no Bennite," on the radio and on TV this week, when the Boy Scout was fighting in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father on TV tried to be illoyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his Cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MEPs after all the reports at their Monday night ceremony.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the structure of the social media, a breeding site of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign to be a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think that way.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of on Monday's start of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report from Public Health England on e-cigarettes
According to a state-funded agency, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers have called the data into question and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE to claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called up to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to lead their opinions on the damage to various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Katewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managers were supposed to have previously received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT's public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco management also took part in the meeting.
The research work of the group "confesses" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Katewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were premature as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers."
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims have already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die a year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticised the BBC for placing them in hard-to-argue time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will or will send programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or do.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I do not see why a progressive tax programme is financed, which could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this public-law television is supposed to be.
I don't think that would even reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series running Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular BBC shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-legal niche programs should go "to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of radio charges," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put it in a window where no one ever wanted to see it.
With regard to the radio fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more progressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky- and Channel 5-head David Elstein, who also said to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and maintain."
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example on the public service television stations in Australia and Canada to "change this to" inform, clarify and maintain. "
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV, and with the commercial channels to enter alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenics in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the process could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fade worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate the worms.
The increased ultrasonic waves have an effect on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, says a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with the impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves of tissue can happen unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons trade show video.
Terrible killer drones!
The foot joint is shredding legs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's willingness to throw weapons into the spotlight to repressive regimes through the Defense and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: From September 15 to 18 with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you can read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £pack of bus keys, which is claimed to "gain access to about one third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists go to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works for no profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms fair - through a space of the ExceL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic two-way company advertising, but "by the flushing in with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be handled illegally in front of our home door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are shutting up fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a mission of the US army on "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that provides outstanding retroactive effects within the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to swam: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly don't love Marmite or hate it, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people often turn into drink recipes, film-night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and get their underwear.
related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a retreat, but many student homes form a space-to-space-bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of sociality is exhausted - and send a text message instead of knocking on it.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
As you start the university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine a plate of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and in the end may associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat make people sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a dishwasher to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that stops people from sleeping or working.
It is not just about being a decent person, but about being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the true sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they care to put Drum & Bass a little bit quieter, because it was 3: 00 in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5: 00, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had her own music plagued, closed her door and went to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse were to move into the same dorm?
On the other hand, it would not be abysmal to think of a roommate for your future wife, to get to her, to separate herself and then to see her every day and perhaps to see her, to see how she's going to get all the friends together?
Of course the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk your lower body into a little reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never screw up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not fix your properties on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-earners
The real estate company Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the central Franconian corner for people who don't have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single-parent mother and the low-earner."
"I show how you can still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to quickly create favourable housing: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are going to press the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasium has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living room has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
This is obvious.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly under construction law.
It always makes it particularly complicated the threatening Damoklesschwert special building and the parking regulations.
Horrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house will need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you step up the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It is true that in the last five years we had a tree in Germany, but luxury apartments were built, which can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message that the normal people also need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-earner.
I'll show you how to build cheap and good even today.
That's the point.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message that reports that the "software update has failed."
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait for the storm to go back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by slowing up the update. It will also be easier to do so when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be switched off half way and this could lead to an abrupt update.

You should also ensure that before you download our checklist of all things have been through to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: Full attack
In the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1, Nico Rosberg has only one foreign currency against his clearly leading Mercedes team member Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack."
The second World Cup, before the start, stressed in the decisive seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve season races and are also taking the Floothlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its series, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen for the cure more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation that was received by chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Red-White" is seen as an expression of his commitment to the spa town.
Quartier's office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistik have gathered under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new office has recently been opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and advice seekers will immediately receive information on issues such as care insurance or health and care insurance services.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have found that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also, not often many services are not used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly yet understood," explained the new home-owner Jutta Weigand, who, as business manager, is also responsible for the artist and the civil hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus."
In addition to the discussions, the new office offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or physiotherapist treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehab.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is that both directors are particularly concerned with demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the inauguration celebrations, the Quartier Office also dedicated itself to the collection of old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular social cooperation."
The Social Foundation thus made a great contribution to the fact that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 am to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: after the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been set against the third-party player Würzburg Kickers because of the renovation work at the Fuchpark Stadium, the 6 October was now set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayerische Football Totopokal against the third-player FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally cancelled.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7: 00 p.m. at the Bamberger Fuchparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have plan security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hummer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for a large number of spectators, and this is not without reason, because the light games have a special attraction.

Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years ago
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as was said in the exposition.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was entrusted with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking: Tim Wiese charges police officer with money
Ex-football player Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
The football player was once, now Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is engaged, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
He was not intellectually involved.
In the city centre of Bremer, Wiese was just able to cut his hair when he saw a car park guard outside, issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine in front of her, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," it is said from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to display meadow.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of the Isla del Rey are well suited for the development of the marijuana plants.
For three days, the authorities of Panama have been taking out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men are fighting on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, around 11: 45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, and called to them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the gas station site.
One of these men now yelled at the young, and struck him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends hastened and disgraced the bat, he first left his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When you stopped seeing the vehicle, the victim went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a stick, the face and the thigh of the victim were beaten.
The victim had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there's only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second bat was about 1.65 meters in size and was dressed with a jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and signers to report under phone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field building and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongill and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also a pleasure to see Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, however, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the field building practice on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still with his successor in the next few months with half a place.
After a conversion phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, and by then he will invest 310000 euros in the premises on St Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstausens met Frank Müller years ago and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongill, who is currently studying in the Verdener Hospital and wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the garbage users would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself as his own boss soon.
And so you agreed, the garbage people bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior doctor in Sulingen, and was also appointed in 2009 as the senior emergency doctor in the Diepholz district and is a volunteer in the DRK-ready Bruchausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The dumpers, both internists, want to settle down as a house doctor.
"The endoscopy comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongill.
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound studies as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
A total grant of 50000 euros is provided to the Müllers by the district (25000 euros) and the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," stresses Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongill, about 2000 patients come to the practice of rock houses every quarter, and in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor practice.
A positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller: the pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel Felstehaus.
If no successor had found her, she would have left.
By the way, those who are visiting Müller's speaking hours continue to look in familiar faces: the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force take over from the rock houses.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers in a shimmering way.
After a long time, they feel a little weariness.
"But we will continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Your husband adds, "We have a 6000-square-meter plot."
"So far, I've always been out of gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being driven up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course."
The care and safety of the people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept border-free migration flows, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia is refusing
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and may also establish corridors for the refugees.
This was not the case, however, with the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar, in Laibach.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia would step up border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, however, Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already tried to pass the border crossing of Tovarnik / Sid in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to catch them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been in the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
They were mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will expect about 4000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government, however, denied that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do so," they said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid had arrived in the morning, while further buses were expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 km away.
"We heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could in fact lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a somewhat further west-facing route, which was already predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Minister of the Interior, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive border control possibilities."
There are strict controls to be carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have been a good witness to the country since then in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgo border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local look in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border was closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute maps to refugees, on which alternative routes are registered through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine planners was sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of having ever been able to get an insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is to have been used to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of more than $100 million was achieved in this way.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are eventually caught," it is said in the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a strong operation.
People do their concerns, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the Paradeplatz.
Stopping the city's railways.
Pulsating, plentiful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the heading "Before I die I want to die...."
The Ecumenical hospice aid, with this action, drew attention to its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice aid is available to the passers for questions and talks as well as the volunteers.
While some passers spontaneously take the chalk and say "yes to my life," "can read," "drive through the United States with the camper," "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long," others stay short, read, say words like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Over and over again, small discussions are developing about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this public action was good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone on the tables would like to make public, and it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death was still covered with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in the help of death.
When the Ecumenical hospice aid sought by call of volunteers, it had immediately registered and had been there at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by the person concerned and members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can well deal with her task and the experiences and experiences that have been made.
"I see the life of another wait, think it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health funds and donations of relatives and associations allows for the training, training and supervision of the death and mourning staff.
Every two years training is provided for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now shown in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the Lifer-Gigant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
According to a survey of FactSet, analysts expected $10.84.
The lower view comes despite the price increases of 4.9 percent on average and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher increases for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said that, however, it expected the result to increase over the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid income when considering the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to stop 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strageto spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahogany table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the central rate.
There is a wall picture of the United States at the end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairman Janet L. Yelle and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: maximising US employment and maintaining prices here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start from the unprecedented incentive to be weaned from the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solid, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could frighten the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and even by a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself does not guarantee the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator that only shows a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists reduce the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will continue this week's sentence, said John Lonski, head economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time, "he said.
If she does, "she should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, head economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drive global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US Central Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get better control of the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be involved in the decision-making process.
But in the end, the Fed has become a monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its central rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England's interest-fixing committee.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset," said Pozsen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not believe it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to sneak through the corridors.
If the whole shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garden kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is close to the checkout and has various take-away options.
What is here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filleting the fish and even roast for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and gallows, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig-natural bowel, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, including individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the register.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with a body and a soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seekers' home on Dillinger Street.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, it's not like a school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to tell women in a shocking way how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies that suck on breasts that are painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mature milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exemptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited construction of the gymnastics at the Bernrieder sports grounds are step by step: at the recent municipal meeting, the construction application was unambiguously blessed without major discussions.
In the past, the body had, among other things, decided on a request for an "exemption" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
A "roof with a non-central first and roof overlay" is therefore to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar systems: "This will bring us together a wonderfully large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "exemption" was, in turn, about the slope of the roof, which, for energy reasons, should be less than ten degrees, as is required in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "exemption" was necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" in respect of the roof slope - the Bernrieder municipality council is usually more restrictive in the case of applications for exemption.
However, Turnhalenbau is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The Turnhalenbau am Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports.
In the next step of the procedure, the building request for the 18 x 36 m hall is now submitted to the Landrat Office for examination.
Klinik Peissenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital of Peissenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peissenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by the Countess Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing inner station.
The rooms were available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The staff were informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
In the question of who to follow, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this meant in any case an "appreciation" and an extension of the offer in the area of "internal medicine," said Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemaker and defibrillator.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees to this, Fischer and his team will run both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, will be closed in Peissenberg after almost 140 years.
The district had so far planned this for 2018, when the ongoing rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital was completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, met rumors that the House, which is in the possession of the Federal Office, should be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers in the future.
"I rule that out." As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi-move to the leak, which had been "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
There has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as the chief of the house for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau's colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The hospital of Peissenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and birth aid.

Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the abonement on a Maisfeld near Pratau (Wittenberg district) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first, it was unclear how exactly the accident could have happened.
The crime police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from the Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their bodies in a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday fell victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday night, is considered to be a suspect, who, according to the evidence, was found and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve after a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews with the missing persons' friends and acquaintances, there was a suspicion of the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted in the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought to the court on Wednesday, and the investigators put a burden on him.
The further investigation is to be made of the closer circumstances of the act.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
Even more and more refugees are looking for a affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution fights on the German housing market have already started.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units are finished in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many people then hit the housing market and set in the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
At present, around 770,000 living units were missing in the conurbations, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore lived in large cities in emergency rooms in WG.
Young adults were unwillingly staying at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has for the first time fallen in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" Alliance proposes a new start.
The aim is to re-stimulate social housing.
Thus, the basic labour tax could be waived and the basic tax for supported housing suspended on a temporary basis.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options were needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the around 300 million euros available had already been made available on Monday night with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free to go: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no passage, as more and more refugees are taking the road over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will be possible to pass through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian TV station RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make the ordinary asylum procedure in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants the refugees to happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it is people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU-neighbouring country of Croatia.
Most of the media reports are from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus and tax.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this end of the border: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Minebikers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Just before the gate closed on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws consider the removal and damage of the border fence to be a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the "transit zones" newly established on the border, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees would have been there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The refused asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees were gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the road in the past weeks.

No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this change.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria has only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to the government, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instructions of German authorities.
In release, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people were standing with travel sacrifices at the entrance of the tent," said WErnst's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because on Sunday, because of the refugee flow, Germany had stopped the rail traffic with Austria, it was over in Wernstein, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded, along with two other helpers and their cars, were driving across the border to the near Passau.
Before, we have first taken the unhoped guests, with juse and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was for us of course," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man couldn't take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday night in Wels, to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic was stopped to Germany.
The regional train was, however, stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival was connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge course of sports day before - organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more Zigmünden to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has put the Hungarian government's position in the dark of national socialism in a highly official and public way.
The suffering of this policy is not just those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to note that the "promised land," which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for the protection of the people of Europe in the face of the continuing flows of refugees and the coming winter.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have the homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without a great vortex, said Konrad and praised the organisational "master performance."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, there are still 35,000 accommodations to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the Heads of State.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us."
On the platform people can offer easy accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In emergency times, it could not be that it would be necessary to keep a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is more successful in accommodation, with his experience.
I am an older man, who is not easily said to the face of the truth.
Convinced power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
The search for its own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan Square as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as the tips arena and the design center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures at the moment, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of an emergency, further locations are to be checked for their suitability.
The city chief is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seaport: "Limits are not locked"
On Monday, in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the national capital Josef Pühringer (VP) acceded to the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The further movement of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there are the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the German approach.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the S & T stock exchange-based IT group has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in the new yard's start-up companies and later acquiring them.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time."
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S & T in the site, EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-holder opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
This project had to delay the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the dove market arcade in a short time: after all, it has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the business in which they sell, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallet are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
A few weeks ago, it was remodeled.
"I've been thinking for a long time whether to open another store," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who even has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle by her mother.
I am most comfortable when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why such a woman gets in the way of a beautiful handbag, the expert cannot answer with any final certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag improves every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called a host.
This feature also connects some to the billionaire who wants to become the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for fans.
Whether he is a foreign enemy, a journalist or a source of knowledge in the international crisis policy, the candidate for the US presidential office is violating the election campaign.
And it's a good cut.
This is also registered in the Pfälzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-town is related to him over -zig corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt way," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, including Trump, the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to the floor in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of the hearts there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the area was "The Brulljesmacher" - in high German: the host, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the owners.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The building stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of Trasik: their desire to return to their home country in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Pfälzische Geschichte and Folkkunde, Roland Paul, had declared a film start.
Trump was the grandson of a "illegal emigrant."
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like that, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of the Trumps ("The grandmother was a born trump, the grandfather was a born Heinz").
The retired winemakers see the American rather distant, "he is always so bursting."
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The retirement worker Veronika Schramm mentioned, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family spent on a visit to the church organ, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They would like it better if he did not take the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting issues than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And, "The grapes are ripe even without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinema singers, and also in the USA the interest is awakened.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf."
From the hand of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitants village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer."
In the neighbouring country the Alpenverein is responsible for the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are going to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major changes in the assessments for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the Federal Capital, when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise reached an average of 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was less than that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Raffers Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5: 00 to 5: 30) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, on average 46.000 spectators.
The second half hour (5: 30 am to 6: 00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour was 720,000.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas for the second night of The Chase Australia, Nine, will be confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million-dollar minute that did not manage to cross the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman with which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was kept in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women left out in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should Woods get last rose?" their answers could become a game perverter, who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except for themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and (Sarah) and noticed Sam's energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that all along the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well-suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her realize that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not she, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls in the same way - it's an indecision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday, 7: 30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some of the trainers would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a grudge as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Converted did on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to get a point return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his ragged catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pats at a point that was restored in the first part of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for for his NFL debut.
After the Fumble, Hayne left the field and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gay
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field with weapons force.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, confiscated his oil company Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts.
The Free Electors are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn class in Großwallstadt, party and group head Hubert Aimanger warned of a serious crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse," said Aimanger.
"Otherwise, we will get depressions in the Bavarian education system."
The country-day group of the Free Electors will meet in the lower Franconian community until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Elector Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overtake the cure," said Aimanger.
Aimanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"This is no longer the case, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Elector Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to defer the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aimanger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aimanger.
The FW-Chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states across the country."
"Bavaria is moving, others are not."
"We need to become more active there."
But the country policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, KultusMinister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot project "middle-level plus" at 47 high-school schools, which will test an extension of the high-school middle-level from three to four years - in the result it will take again nine years to graduate.
But that doesn't go far enough.
"The topic G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We call for freedom of choice for all the high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Festere Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long distance of free and nervous trade.
It was only in the afternoon that a firm start of the US stock exchanges was made for a clear direction, which ultimately carried the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points up.
The MDax won 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technological TecDax increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the euro-zone central index was 1.01 percent ahead of 3207.60 points.
Solid profits also recorded the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index was the last to record about 1 percent in the plus.
Many stock exchanges expect that the markets will be on the spot this Friday until after the US interest rate decision and also for the large drop in the forward exchange.
In the meantime, the discussion about the loads from the nuclear exit has pushed the shares of RWE to a record depth and also left deep traces in the case of Eon.
According to "Spiegel" the German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in provisions.
The Federal Government denounced the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered, but in the end always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report of the US investor's magazine "Barron's" from the weekend worked.
As a result, the German chipbuilder was currently not paying enough attention to investors.
The investment in future-looking wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were again sold than in the previous year's period, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automotive Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car builders Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
In the German pension market, the circulation rate of the listed Bundeswerkpaper fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index increased by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund-Future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The price of the euro fell in the afternoon to the last $1.1262.
By noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1,1305 (1,1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandeji, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before using rubber shots.
20 police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The fight was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Mashesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disputes since the 10th century.
Killed August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been central for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
A mix of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
You wait for the appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
What investor is in question is not yet clear.
As a result, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented for the first time public plans for the project.
Some people are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facilities
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, greeted, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday house settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The Stakeholder, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Construction," presented his plans for the first time in public on Monday night in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP Group, which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system-construction management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it was good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project has been in the debate for months now, which is about EUR 10 to 12 million.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel building were produced by heavy reactions among mermaid owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, a mermaid and a member of the board of directors in the interest of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a huge mess that overcomes all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase significantly due to the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make it more likely," said Schulz.
What happens exactly on the well one hectare of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must have a coherent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Two-year-old at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is happy about the young people of its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twins are rare with Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said of the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian has so far kept her close to the body.
At first, the "picture" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, as they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com / refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to receive food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved to be efficient, but most of the studies have been performed in people who are mentally obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 to compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tubing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% resolved the diabetes disease in full and 28% in part.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and in part only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the 'surgical' group, "the authors found out.
The researchers also monitor the patient's blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin of A1c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you are reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared to the gastrointestinal group, achieved major reductions in the BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a more complete outage of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in the case of fat-based people undergoing obesity surgery, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is now increasingly considered in the belletrics: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly in school times, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Actually we are not like that" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the history of love, the novel is likely to be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker's readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents in the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the US's violent reaction led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand-disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
The Georgia Poison Center says that poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who are taking highly alcoholic hand-disinfectants.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of the income of hand-disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are getting to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a mutant in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinfectants.
"A child does not think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are the ones that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, which are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
In the case of small children, very few injectors can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of the University of Kansas, the Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whisky around, but people leave these hand-disinfectants in the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spitters of a fragrant hand-disinfectant in the school, was brought to an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold, which is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinkett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was able to hear her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watch her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand-disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities' employees suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "mean" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-disinfectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the plan to be a "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was easily injured in a hit-in accident on the cross-section between Nordring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-section towards the roundabout industrial area and was aware too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he hit the back of an Audis with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta.
The police reported damage to the vehicles involved in the accident of about EUR 10 000.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to move and had to be towed.

The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show the highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers are not here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, swear Deila.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, which now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points in the lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Being together now is so important.
Warburton careful with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was plowing on some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
The ex-boss of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea-Stürmer Michu, in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.

McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in poker games or leagues that have not won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
In the period May to July, unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than that of the UK of 5.5%, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (US) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now falling to 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunk disrupted the process

The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was in custody at first.
Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of a late legal intervention, I will watch a man get killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I started to fear.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a more macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
If you are selected, you will see it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you get access.
I was complaining to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
If he dies, he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go into all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after moist police chase persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and humptuous water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a house-breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape to the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said," I'm not coming out, come and get me, "said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop is negotiating."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Team football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables in the past year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what is best for racing and that he found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tuber sample at Lidaris that he can't explain.
He had held back 18 months for the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the main raised, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Before, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information on what I do within my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL act cowardly and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and break me up, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the trainer have been built up with the long-standing cobalt examination at Lidari, and the late Scratching led to him saying that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after a ride
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries by the helicopter after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia came to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driving and failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Returns against rivals for claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the beating of his players as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly disguised note to the storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" at the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This shows up again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or the techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has made the trend turn for us.
Trent's been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of this shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so that they can play like this.
I'm building more trust because they say these things, because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks making and no points anything exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team will be free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the pre-final at AAMI Park. Ticket sales will start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbier with $200,000 deposit after drug charges
A man who may be in danger of a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and was in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole quantity and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to achieve his release.
"After reading the obituaries of the two people, it is clear that the issue of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he will issue his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police every day and stay at an exit lock of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver's house is breaking apart
In the event of a three-truck accident on the 5 motorway near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital seriously injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he was sleeping, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web search that used terms for the search for unpermanent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then he "pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilith Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court, "he said it would be a addiction that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment that he had taken indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, that he had violated the conditions on 25 January of this year and that he had not appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defensive lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg do not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to get background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was provided with a security deposit, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser deviates from small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up outside the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many locks left people more and more at smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dam.
There they are received by the federal police and forwarded to registration.
According to the Federal Police Department, there were a lot more refugees at the Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8: 00 p.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Rentals of Tropenstorm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm fires in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The strong low was the outlet of the "Henry" tropical storm, which in the last days had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Constance Sea are also expected to be in the range of 60 to 90 hour kilometres until Thursday morning.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The mass does it: every two years the car builders at the IAA show their new things.
In 2015, the main movement is in the compact cars, which are currently selling very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly needed: approximately 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment alone in August, according to the German Federal Office of Transport (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
This year, many new compact models will be presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars.
One of the biggest premiere for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in the hands of the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking for an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
The Hessen also offer other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first only available as a fifth door.
The second version will follow in the spring, which can be seen on the IAA.
And what about new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a fifth door in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the growing segment.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbomotor and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer's information.
Sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but all over new is the compact standard DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger put the hand on the front lot: here the cooling grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time, Apple's CarPlay was integrated.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are on the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human dignity
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex-prisoner of the Teigel Court of Justice who has been housed in an too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were locked in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
This made an ex-prisoner successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area at the Berlin-Tegel Court of Justice between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on the loose, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His action for official liability for the unworthy terms of arrest against the Land of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for a further examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were to be taken into account for the compensation, it was said that a claim for compensation was granted.
Otherwise, "a reduction in the legal protection of the personality would be feared."
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money damage.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, they only granted compensation to a prisoner because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of human dignity.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which, in a parallel case in November 2009, had certified an undignified accommodation for a prisoner.
The applicant was placed in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore kept locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even to the rags, because of the tense situation.
According to the Court Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of young people, and 19 are to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is the case with Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we can do it."
The following overview shows what is going on in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (Federal Ministry of Construction estimate) and 400000 (Pestel Institute estimate) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built so far (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially for affordable rental objects: 60 000 to 80000 social housing will come out of the rental price commitment every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable housing.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created every year and the Federal Government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research estimates that 55% of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get in, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thranhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was earlier a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence requirement, which restricted asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of the population, also because of the lack of skilled workers, has taken on the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are the most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt, the Royal Way to Labour Integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the unrooted parents it is first and foremost important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handbags in different languages.
If the large number of refugees were to increase the need for educators, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stofers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no country prohibits asylum seekers or the patient from studying - the only exception was Berlin so far, but the interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Students could facilitate access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or a duty are no longer receiving benefits under the Asylum Applicant Performance Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the Bafög-eligible persons.
The patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this margin was reduced to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, however, calls for Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Office.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow it certain control possibilities.
This also includes the willingness to fight religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to cause such conflicts in Germany, "have their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a subject of the whole of society much more than today.
This will also have to change the majority of society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has, for a short decade, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it is very slowly learning, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the stakeholders of non-white Germans have long called for, and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention require for Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use its opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the expected refugees so far, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said to the day-to-day spike.
However, additional money had to be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls on all arrivals to hand out health cards at the same time as the registration.
The services provided could be settled later with the Länder.
And in the long term, it was highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Applicant Performance Act.
Otherwise, the doctors make the most of the language barriers to be created.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Bode has shown that migrants are being better informed about their diseases than other patients.
It is not only in clinics, but also in medical practice that interpreting costs should be taken over, it calls for.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
With the partly other disease pictures, German doctors come clear from their education, however, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see." And as far as the medical rule is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and a number of refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and may have to re-examine them.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill, according to the estimates of the Federal Psychiatric Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
The children of refugees are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with a lack of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horror and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
However, so far only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most of the time, staff or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misassessment, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production of "passion," the Circus Probst uses the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the banner of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current mangene production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift to the beggar is in the family's blood.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily life and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Juniorchefin stresses.
"Manegencocktail with a world-city flair," so Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family brings the audience to their attention with a joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to take the Cuban duo loose.
lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon alves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with finger tip and joint.
Balance with the unicycle on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," stressed Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Absence in the attitude of circus animals is only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artist," as they are called lovingly, is read from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the way.
So the top commandment: take good care of the animals.
In particular to her zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponystallion and a zebrate, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a cloak and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the maneuge, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11: 00 and 4: 00.
Thursday is family day, the prices are reduced for the show at 5: 00.
The animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is making the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also grieved by the opposition's claims that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned that they would accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with a pipe.
Last month, they had cut him off and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
She warns the Members of the Parliament concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the context of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is to lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on providing previously unreached, integrated technology solutions for companies," says a company statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that close-focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal-Captain Mikel Arteta says that team members must stand behind the injured Jack Wilthere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Winger stressed to Wilthere that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilthere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain next summer.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilthere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and had then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has seen 23 different diseases from Wilthere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it, and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger is setting up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and to give the players who need a little break," said Winger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 measurements on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has taken the lessons from the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
Friends Festival: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year-old high prove.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In order to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-like and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinical values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said, money really can't buy luck.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was defined by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can certainly refer to it, even though they often refuse to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone care department explained to me,... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and are in danger of suicide has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term response mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit Comedy Central Friends Fest this weekend with the completely redesigned scenery for the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
In his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, Di Maria will help PSG to move to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player, who set the French Master on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a headball in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the KO rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahim's missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2: 0, to cause problems to our opponents and to look back in a relaxed way, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not reach another or two goals. "
After his injury, Ibrahim returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on the weekend was able to hold a 2-2 indefinitely in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinean wing storm was called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, he closed off to Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
If, however, someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, was a heavy opponent with nine national players in the field and two deep in the middle field.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far past Kevin Trap's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some mismatches and bad financial statements, not least from Ibrahim, who in no less than five attempts was left alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his players in the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahim who turned Di Maria into a shot that was led by Wiland in the 52nd minute by the post...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan reached its sixth saisontor after Ibrahim had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough. "
Get off of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt-identification plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is fighting with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencores stock price to the top of the London stock exchange in the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to raise about a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares of 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing rate on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrived is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to take a constructive approach to areas of disagreement," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing self-awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sad Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
= = = Barcelona = = = The Bayern FC was clearly a few years ago before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times poker winner, four times champion league winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the EM 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that's what FC Bayern registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
The change was not made.
And the decisive man for that works today for the German record master: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008 / 2009 season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the red (4: 0, 1: 1) and at the end celebrated the King's class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, then you do it in the production of the film and not in the production of the show," Damon assured.
Brown was shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian were confirmed.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker that's being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights in the film; Damon replied that their director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After a white police officer killed the teenager Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved country-wide impact and urged legislators and authorities to fight discriminatory practices against colored abstinence.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matter," he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media models invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior" crowns first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the great prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero talked to E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the great price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
As suddenly... as I can't even imagine what that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, even though he was the first to finish the race course, does not get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will get the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's got any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was to be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they'd changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the filming will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the final place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field on Tuesday.
The Twins lost a chance to get up within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) opened 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game in a very concentrated way.
The signed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the baton well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (impact training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he put it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back in the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a band, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the signed rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who designed a two-run for the right-hand-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run on the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27 times in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against the close of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right-hand man, however, stabbed Sano at three pitchs for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a non-moving Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers reached three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game, after he had missed more than a month due to a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitchs in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff batter in the first place, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
In the second, the Tigers achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Goose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez left because of an injury to the throw shoulders.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a shoulder breakdown, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He's been missing from the right hip since August 20th.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it are to be placed in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on the Tuesday night.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government's first-to-take programme, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Also Frankfurt and Hanau have set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive thinking about military options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective thinking."
Four years ago, it was a good thing that the cup passed by a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is coming to our front door," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday night in the Austrian television station ORF that no one was sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's what's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU's Home Affairs Ministers want to take a new start at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) to ensure the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee situation in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the countries more closely in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The Federation would manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the Prime Ministers in the Berlin Chancellery Office.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would also have it.
However, those who do not have a lead restriction perspective could not stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is part of the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that the planned new border fence was to prevent Schlepper from looking for signage chutes about Romania.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, the eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice-panzer of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean fades.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the "Cassini" space probe.
The moon is therefore easily swamped around the ring planet on its track.
This tame movement is only small, but still too large for a constantly fixed celestial body, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (New York State) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
For example, in 2006, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of the Saturn moon, which spear water vapor and ice articles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to renounce the "Offensivakteur Valdet Rama" for about a month.
An investigation had shown an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich's lion, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced break."
"This is hard for us, Rama is a heartless loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unparalleled professional.
As a training guest, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove its ability."
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to be in running training.
In the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3), Okotie had hurt his head in a severe collision.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blemish.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to take care of his slender line is often advised of him.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: B-vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits therefore support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS is again hiring up to 95000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started the recruitment of seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are wanted.
Last year, UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 aid.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements in the past year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought the package services to a very critical level.
First hair storm, then striking cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the north of the Alps, the hair-dryer breaks through, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with a storm through the hair dryer.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a striking cold front is crossing us, which brings strong rainfall, wind floors and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British islands in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the hair dryer.
As a result, the hair dryer blows up to Thursday morning in the hair-dryer valleys with trees from 60 to 100 km / h, isolated and in particular in the Urnerland with more than 100 km / h.
The hair dryer can move to the adjacent middle country, and on the mountains even hurricane floors of more than 120 km / h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the alpensüdhang begins to dust.
This is where the rain stops until Thursday night.
In total, in the next 48 hours, the south of the Alps will have to be expected to have some over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer will go out of the air, and a cold front will then roll over Switzerland with a strong, partly tidy, rain from West to East.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go down significantly.
The following days will be present in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a so far nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday to the name of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working group of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries, as a minority, could often only live their faith in the hidden.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546), as a young Augustine monk, stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
At that time he felt the city was a lost sin.
His negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then started the division of the western church with his thesis against the trade in waste.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Othar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been given to the 75-year-old - which is by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective issues, this can seem quite darker.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "book of all books."
There are cycles that deal with topics such as the crossroads, plagues, commandments or our own.
Thus he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, has dealt with the respective Bible places.
He has interpreted the Bible posts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original Bible quote and a set of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
The 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were in the end a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Hernhuter Order.
"There the education was already done with the cane," Othar Alt remembers.
"I tried to work this out, so that perhaps I could get along with the Lord Father."
His second concern was to make art more important in a fast-running time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolic is being pushed away.
Artists have a different desire and joy to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Othar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the pictures, to make them work, to discover and to feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Alt did not care to fully capture the Bible, but chose the topics that are important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not an eye-level cooperation," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX-Bahn near
Plans made, found place, company commissioned, Earth Hill modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was finished.
Absence in politics and administration led to oppression, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So the hills were shut down, the new place was sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will take place in October, the first municipal council, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, was now able to report in the children's and youth's outlay.
"I hope that this year will still be visible," she said.
The work of the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without "further pause."
DFB intensifies engagement for refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear sign on the weekend.
Football is responding to the growing situation in Germany, and it is helping politics to deal with the problems that are in the process.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that it is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone," said DFB-Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be at the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would like to help.
But the decisive course of action must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some of the Bundesligists also support this program.
This weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will be on the left jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the imprint "We help - # refugeeswelcome."
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "self-evident."
"The refugee drama is everyone's concern, no one can look away."
"We football Bundesligists can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large community of German football."
It was great that all 36 licensing clubs had launched their own projects in their places.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will make available EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already picked up the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief of Management loses an eye in the event of an accident
The head of the board of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has, according to several reports, lost the left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a water glass after midnight, which he had carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled out, passed out, then dragged himself out to the street - he told us that last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully working."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software conferences.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott, the "SZ."
McDermott usually commuts between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
He felt it was important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "This can happen to anyone."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible for the night race in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Fever in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all the hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have finally broken down.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7: 00 / Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topspiel against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect him to return to the training on Friday."
In view of the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem milk on the reus position.
So he announced a change at the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stamkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
In the future, however, Tuchel left open the question of whether Weisenfeller will be used in all the Europe League games.
He will also play the second game with a high probability.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League should be the goal, says midfielder Julian Weigl is understandable: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotercars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany is to be a technological leader in the change of the car, according to the German Government's will.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrendt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car, Dobrendt spoke of a "new age of mobility."
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrendt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test line on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to "do not raise any additional liability risks," the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 hour kilometres.
The Federal Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, it was "to be expected to be far after 2020" on public roads.
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital network of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD transport policy Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-propelled cars still see sceptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the Refusal Organization Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the US.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom digital association, only seven percent would agree to pass control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway, this could be 15 percent in the running traffic, 45 percent in the traffic traffic.
Well, no one in the fourth would under any circumstances leave the car in control.
Boll cancel team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorf village, according to the current state of the art, only wants to open up in the single place in the title fights from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship event in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the set list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at the time, and we became European champions."
"We should focus on this," said the world rankings-fifth.
The English national football player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis of the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger pointed to a shin break.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant Terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax-figure-horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: the mannequins that look terrifying human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and so he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant Terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the walk), which will be seen from 18 September in the art hall of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is a good thing that the fashion maker has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little bit like death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diedren.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hard-to-see work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
The show is not built in chronological terms, but it is an excellent choreographed complete artwork, for which a lot of effort has been done: for example, a stylist was dedicated to the cleaning of the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have taken 14 tons of material to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was still a special skate: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi's meeting Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Also Gaultier's old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, tender, fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he has dressed his Teddy BH's and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show he was unable to pay for the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines were in and around ploughs about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modesspitze Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Lit, fashion played a greater role, then was pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional attractions.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all the orders.
Modespiitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they can bear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, around 80% of the turnover has been lost.
There are almost no more private trade and also the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The mass goods are now produced much cheaper in the Asian area and distributed almost exclusively by chains.
In addition, exports were weak, currently to Russia and to the USA.
So there are sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomatic designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Exposition of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, we need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think primarily economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places the machine sticks small balls.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not begin with a traditional Plauener lace."
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it forms the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener's tip - young and old," Reuter says.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in ploughs and surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
This is how I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauer tip.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney still dared to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," this is not about a new film, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
He who plays after Julie Andrews for more than 50 years is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the movies.
Xi urges the economy to open up more widely to the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to a group responsible for steering the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new start-ups and to advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access rules, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), the inclusion of private capital, and the overhaul of the local reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a state-of-the-art business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," said the statement.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large-scale predators and thus to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which is a relevant EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators are already so heavily charged with mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limits, about 50% of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch referred to this as a "trick," because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide diversion that helps the economy alone," said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for man, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in predators.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of the unborn."
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment, on its homepage, states that "a health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment mainly through coal burning.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants are exiting more than six tonnes of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and surface-covered," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the EU's plans: www.mercury-action.foodwatch.de
