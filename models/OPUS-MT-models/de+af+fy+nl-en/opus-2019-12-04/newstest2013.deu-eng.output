A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that the election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
The Republicans' lawyers have, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make the process of registration or the course of the course of the year difficult.
This phenomenon has gained in importance following the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives were recorded in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present a photo card and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time-limits for the early vote, declare the right to register as a voter on the day of the election, and agree to the right of citizens to vote for which a court record is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the voters to show a photo card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have supported draft laws in 34 states, which have forced the voters to show a photo card.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million elective persons, do not have a photo card issued by a government authority in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the necessary ID.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This is even more important.
Students who are considered to be voters who are increasing their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who are more likely to choose the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for election.
Before 2004, no state for the election required proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
It is clear that two out of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the day of the election.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide help to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the electoral registration campaigns in the general elections in 2004 have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the white people, who represented 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the display of a photo card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are crucial for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral committee to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation for the men already unlocked to carry out early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got the opinion of two medical professionals.
In the studies carried out in the US, there were many factors of interference between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been identified.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer must be made really clear to the patient by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the long-term quality of life and in these cases it is more likely to be active in monitoring the disease.
Today, many men who have seen cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and are offered treatment in the event of the disease's progress.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for a decision on who should be treated and who not.
That is why I still recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not to be performed.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, the Canadian cancer society's spokesman.
However, about 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several of them remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It is very damaging to the health of people.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette has been removed, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, glands, bowel, oesophagus, pancreas and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against cancer of the gut throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing a cancer of the grum or mast.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their studies are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family premonition.
"The conduct of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyses
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused a certain amount of attention last summer, for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter, but not yet empirical.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely safe about it.
However, let us assume that it is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being wrong, and let's look at what it is.
There is a law in this world that is inevitably inevitable, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard because you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," with this "state" in general being made up of some of their characteristics.
On the basis of this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizens, who are called fermiones, who are kind to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way): the mesons that we are not going to treat here and the "power particles," through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carrier of force."
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all the particles and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And not all particles interact equally with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good," asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to carefully examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, many physicists who are most eagerly hoping that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again up!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was at the beginning considered a "laboratory play."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has introduced the Nobel Prize in Physics to it in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her committee on "Death in dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that ate him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've managed seven years," he said half-hearted, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped with the food.
Brave he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is peeing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the person's ability to take a step back," he notes.
In the opinion of several people working in the palliative care, great events are taking place in the middle of these steps.
The patients who are enrolled in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer covered by so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation."
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that you put on a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of volunteers for body care and help with food intake.
The palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for the palliative care of 11.700 people.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family and patients alike," reports Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
There is no day in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while being struck in his honor, a young man of 36 years, who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients of less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients enrolled in the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to a care that should ease the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care in the Grand Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec that makes several doctors specialised in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law on the control of death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent Palliative Care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all are entitled to high-quality palliative care before one accepts to go to the aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without taking any measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients in spite of the worst forecasts.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry to give up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the care staff that they have not accepted this wish after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
It must be made clear, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the company of the home palliative care of the Grand Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, therefore, the doctors often use the terminal sedation, which leads to the patient to sleep either sporadic or permanent until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to use this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to get me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Road-building officials, construction companies, money-providers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia are involved.
A "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has been disrupted since the drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Member of the Commission in Quebec and former Head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him because of an in-depth investigation of the imtrust in the road works contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he points out that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them hauled their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors down," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to audit, assess and analyse the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force," which since 2009 has led to the "Canalisation cartel" of Montreal being more restrained in the artificial blow-up of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and has raised allegations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were specifically charged.
The latter has aroused a great deal of attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand in the game all over the world by giving more than 80.000 Canadian dollars (about 60.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals that were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organised an illegal raising of funds for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they have been lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices by 30-40% with false additional benefits.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led to a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to make an alarm.
As a mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she was opposed to the sale of a community property that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to construction companies in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the study, which is ultimately carried out, she says that she "moves on a thread that allows the functioning of the system that is subject to ants to be understood in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, he is concerned about the role of the "leaders who are in the picture of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "I was told that this was only a weak clash of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
It recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who are laughing at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not going to break out with enthusiasm.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They therefore benefit from the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entrances of this summer are used to performing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti is giving all the technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us the place of the top rider.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the back of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for...
To become a great European association, Paris must win the title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG will be given the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we are really at the heart of the idea of this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
You should normally be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams, like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, are all about the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media are expecting too much of the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
But if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what else people are expecting.
We could never win at 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be a 15-point lead for the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahim.
So much the better that you're talking about a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahim is powerful and shoots a lot of gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from turning out some time.
I saw things there that made me come out stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the "Bleus."
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we have to show an exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, is close to the players and encourages the victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the indecision forced in Spain on 16 October (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a similar game in my career.

The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of bitcoin reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later before recovering to about 10 dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade in real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to make progress in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file will also make it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts' accounts that are distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, who has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a file to be destroyed, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain without a link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divisible up to a hundred million, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," explains Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind of
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat says that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to enforce, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB's report, by the way, provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake the possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And to ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, and the injured and the devout.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Usbeken and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discrete.
The French troops were taken from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans.
The truck and tank convoy overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflow in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by the war due to the fighting of the various rebellious groups.
Their acquisition of power was then considered to be a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting of subcontracts.
They have misled themselves, and most of them have not even been involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have been able to make use of American funds: the capital escape is significant.
The young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obskurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain managers, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are owned by mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, which are a modern world, is seen everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militia in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the Prime Minister's office, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dusts are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to control the infrastructure.
The rumor was that Afghanistan had immense resources.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to take possession of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young people, French Institute for French at the universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a civil-military service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has been able to help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, well, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What kind of souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2000 meters.
The message received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising of foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Scratch in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt, with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it the unlimited power of authority, remains more than ever divided, has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone on Wednesday, he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this Assembly two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has been based for almost two years now on a provisional text which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only made the country more divided.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "the right with his feet."
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to find his public and democratic legitimacy again, while the protest is raging all over the country.
After an interview with the American Weekend Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be happy to vote.
In particular, as an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian people with this use of an overhasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 to a large extent, Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the request.
Just before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away, as they believe that they were unable to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators thought it was entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel considered that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly did not go very well.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of justice."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made a more strict application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberals, who only see this as a propaganda attack, return "hypocrisy."
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is about other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which gives an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of theocracy in this. "
The fears of the Liberals are also raised by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system, "says Alexis Brouet, who writes a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that "in relation to Article 220, there may be a ambiguity, as the terms used are rejected from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Ann. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The situation of the blasphemy is being maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch stresses.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on TV last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The promised land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Bend in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bath in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his wonders: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding party, the walking on the water, the silence of the sea tower and the fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
The believers here take the path of the Passion or the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on the Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the Salvation stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is located in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the Cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the walls of complaint, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
Traditionally, there people of different beliefs leave notes with wishes, which then come to pass.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod of the Great built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins of their own power.
Everyone else brings an air-seiner to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high, the famous ski resort Hermon is located, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 km.
According to an old legend, pagan gods were supposed to live on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On one trip only, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be allowed to visit.
The Israel Museum is not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, old Qumranschrijsschrift or scroll rolls are kept by the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is shown there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
The entry is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most powerful department is the monument for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When the space is entered, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceanariums.
It is amazing that the Red Sea is also served in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 ° C and the air warms up to 23 ° C.
The dead sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of strapped nerves.
To touch the secrets of the age
This secrets the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets, which are named after the signs of the stars.
Fortuna is to be the legend according to all who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can find new married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo stores.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and opera are performed today.
watch list for tourists
If you are going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is rather taken not into euros, but in dollars that can simply be changed to shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the subtown to the upper city.
In fact, it's an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, independent of the means of transport, that is enough for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday in Israel.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without scales and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with jam and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, fried balls of purebred beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats, which are comfortable and indelible through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
The average cost of tickets for museums is 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and leisure seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the promised country, which represents a 51% increase compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates.
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families that remain in their home country.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each migrant worker must take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme only applies to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, in the future, the tests will become a duty for all the host workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of legislation that need to be done.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who have received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the audit bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of the International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 appropriate centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the law came into force in the press, civil rights people asked the following question several times: what is the point of the whole?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
In particular, speakers from the Migration Authority responded to the question of reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the Head of Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Severew.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems for migrants without work, education, language skills and medical attention.
Severew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will inevitably meet people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of help in a dark, tight barracks, where he will stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you are promised the One, and on arrival you will be betrayed, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the labour migration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scam, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they cannot only control the language of the destination country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children take the first chance to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
The following important aspect of the law is highlighted by the civil rights authorities.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for unauthorised persons prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fake and we are not registered, and that is why there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Hushkadamov to journalists.
"Just don't scare the cost of wrong papers"
The day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some counterfeit certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by the Federal Migration Authority's staff.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for free: every migrant who hoped to save the tests in this way paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main direct task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily bought, both officials and civil rights are agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise to host workers who fall through the test the first time, that they will be given time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crime is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities are thus responding to recent events: injured in the shooting of weddings and seven dead in the amoclop of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in the public and raise the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening."
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal officer, Vasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in 2012 over six months, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law on private arms owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors in Moscow, any weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that takes arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other weapons sold illegally are from military weapons camps.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and that is why the expert reports that the weapons are under-hand on the black market, for example in Moscow."
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
A lot of guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes craft, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
The report says that half of all weapons on the black market are there by "the blame of those responsible for their work on weapons."
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons are from conflict areas, 14% are from theft in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapons store that does not want to be named by name assures that for a long time now, no one has been buying weapons found in the event of illegal excavations because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supply in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example a type TT gun, is bought via a ensign.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know all about it and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most frequently about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone drew attention to me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja," where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you have to go and date a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who has the daughter lost a tooth."
I even get a few strokes about someone I trust.
He also delivers the strokes to me only because he knows I'm not going to beat him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the Schemas have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered for various purposes. "
There is no need for any papers, nor are there any personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," it is said in the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or a gun."
There users give up your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless headers, and buyers who want to buy weapons are going to get into the network.
People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in Siberia and get to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: the website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
Those responsible will accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the weapon's hiding place," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that, in the end, you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless headers, and buyers who want to buy weapons are going to get into the network.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military weapons camps by middle-range guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period January to October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion detected in the context of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast-food and supermarket employees strike
Every fourth American youth is sitting behind the Mc Donald's cash register at some point.
In the past few days, there have been massive protests all over the United States against low wages in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests are going to get any further or whether they are going to get out of the air soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests have the aim of setting up trade unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organised in a trade union way.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to a handful of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, covered branches of the chain whose target group are people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the small-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheap only because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests called for wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to completely turn the wage increases on the customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
The supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that there was only a protest in nine states and that they did not give the company any losses.
The Black Friday lasted in its shop from 8: 00 in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, the Walmart-Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions on the Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, claimed that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had completed the work and that the protest was just "another PR trick" of the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and are therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get away with so little money in New York, I cannot understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people were behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the young people still lived with their parents.
No one saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there for longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I'm constantly meeting people who complain that they have to come out with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 p.m. in the morning before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The US law prohibits the management of the company from standing in the way of this goal and the withdrawal or release of members of the trade union.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should together support the fast food employees so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New York man deserves!."
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which not all are in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands of people work in New York.
It is not yet possible to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be overloaded moderately so far"
The theme of the extended reality popular with supporters of modern technologies is, in recent times, usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
In the summer, Google presented a working model at its annual conference, and in November, it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
In conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear, however, that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please give a brief description of the research your group is doing.
- We are concerned with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase in which pixels are used on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are progress, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also his environment.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always want to inform all the surrounding people about its actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche is good.
For example, in the area of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short, rather than with uninviting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But all in all, the future includes mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language.
- How so?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this spray can?
They say it and point it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what can not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that we will have to work in the next few years to develop new types of sensors that will enable people to understand more closely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device like this, just without contact control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera features to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identification of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the hand on the way, but I think the most amazing version would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in it lies their strength (private only you can see), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's doing a great job of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something to do with, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays in a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as if someone were puking over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve transmission in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to overload the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overloaded moderately, and we have many years ahead of us.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avant-garde," which is dedicated to residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg Art Scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city, often found recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bear, who is once found at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are shown, they attract large crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, makes his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
He recently caught a turning organ and became a Petersburg turning organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic being, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city, for example?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, imagery and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the Graunorm creates aggression and bad behaviour.
But I want to talk to the people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Museum of Culture in Newskij, where my work was exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters then ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the paintings of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina," which was the result of "Pushkinskaya 10," and then it was over.
I'm attracted to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all of this was united in your kind of clinic... it was important to me to be at the heart of St. Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schür got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schür and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight jerks, and they also included the composer Igor Wdowin, who was told today.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regular guests went.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "Artists of the Year," and I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real beads and clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and I'm afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it all wipes up and loses its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and is focused on the outside and not on the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit it in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
We've just seen you in the role of the city's turnaround player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
People used to form large groups: the Bohemia loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand will come to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- To him come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come, not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is going to be destroyed.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures that were even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov in a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
There are often misunderstandings today.
It's called spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cult experts.
They say, "Servants of culture."
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Tsar, because the Tsar may not understand much about culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are good consultants in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg, we have some experts that could be experts, but they are blocked from the way, because it is necessary to have higher-level experts who properly assess the former and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say honestly that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore need to look for other museums.
- What's for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less with us.
Art must be modern again, just like at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by the City of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthquake inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in great height or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants were already carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of peas grown in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Dysophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, watch eggs were sent into space to explore the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It's developing a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid ground, the chicks went wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely mute.
The chicks did not respond to light and loud.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then set the whole thing up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew notes for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatelite "Bion" will only have the same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but once again it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats were given offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkowa.
The most valuable that humanity has is the female organism.
Our möwe flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after that flight?
"Finally, no one answered that question," says Space veteran Wachtang Watschnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight to space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also Cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaya, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
There's still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in flights to the orbit," Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov concludes, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the preparation center of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the Cosmonauts win routine for the work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander were testifying that life on the land was getting away from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's stomach for about 9 months in the fruit water, and that it can then become more easily used to water.
In principle, this makes sense, since from birth to first swimming only two weeks pass.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So, while for a newborn child the weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not get out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly recuperated and the ability to push the child out is also reduced.
All right, let's get this over with birth-introducing tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is a mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the people of the earth break into their spaceships into a distant planet that will be home for their born in space.
NKū-Chef: Control of the black system failed by debt of politics
In the context of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but falls back in its application.
In the conversation for Mütálně.cz this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyší kamadní úřad, NKù), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I do not think that is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be shared control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he led the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system."
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the President of the Government to come, and the control office whose duty is to control compliance with the law is to prevent it from doing so," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was the specific point?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
In a simplified way, it is about the European legislative system defining how public procurement is to be handled, on which national legislation is to be built, and, finally, there is the real practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to see very interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even more "strict and perfect," but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project?
This kind of joint control could help us stop constantly trying to make the laws perfect and to reduce and eliminate thresholds, if this is not likely to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of procurement thresholds does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that in this way, we are only bursting the system with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds were higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKū, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is only a little different, but in principle both authorities work in a similar way.
The skills are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, that is to say, there are these Court of Auditors in the individual Länder - in that the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in line with our state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
I'm not sure, but as I said, I don't like this kind of comparison.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with working with our authority, would they?
As for Czech legislation, what was the importance for your authority of the revision of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
As our controls take place afterwards, a certain delay has to be expected here.
So far, we are more likely to have an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of risks of inefficiency" and have examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will of course have an effect here, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of calls for tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law as positive, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are "more stringent" and cannot be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any failure to comply with the procurement law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts red tape under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us first of all say what is not the way forward.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not involve the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the President of the Government to come, and the Office of Control, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, is to prevent it from doing so.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we act like nothing was.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic to exclude the bidder with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there is a single ice-glass, but mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice.
However, the roads are generally well accessible, and sometimes there is a need for increased caution.
Karlbad
In the district of Karlovy, the streets were well accessible this morning, and there was some snow and ice-glass.
The temperatures are down to -5 to -10 ° C, and the temperature is to get a little warmer during the day.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower heights there is only a thin snow ceiling.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the trees of the Archergebirge.
According to the district street guard, there was a limited view because of fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
All road routes in the second and third categories of road, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, on these roads, the required or outstretched snow remains in a section.
In the higher levels, therefore, more attention is needed.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is a danger because of ice-glass, in higher layers and in the mountains there is sometimes a snowy layer on the streets, the road and motorway management reports on its website.
The street championships warn drivers of ice-glätte, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Eisglätte can be found in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A long-run snow layer is located in the hills of the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or light, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C, the wind is weak.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well accessible, but local attention is needed, and the way of driving is to adapt to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice-glass on the streets.
It is also expected to be a fog, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
This information is from the district street championships.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the street championships between the 80th and the 131th kilometers.
The first class of roads are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov there can be a cut-off to ice glass.
The second and third street-class trains are moist and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc District
Today, snowmocks have to expect drivers who are on their way to the heights in the Olomouc district.
After the use of stray vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
In the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count on snowmag towards Jeseník, "said a staff member of the road administration Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to their information the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the tracks are still moist.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In North Bohemia, the street championships report a number of difficult road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice-glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero in deeper layers, so that snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the deep levels, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic problems have been reported so far.
Eisglätte is reported in particular from the area of Štětí.
According to Meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I / 13 at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The block of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches that were pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people are so happy to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's decline.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event, which we have been planning for two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning.
On the day before, on December 20, three concerts will be held at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21: 00.
The end of the concerts should be in about the time the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally it was me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's decline, but also, together with the public, we want to think about the state in which we once give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains against the world's downfall, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded the so-called hymn against the world's decline with the title "World Departure falls out."
Already today the hymn is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, provided that everything works and the world will not end...
The hymn is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transferred live in a direct connection from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We are trying to get these people involved in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us, and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the results of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, where we have been working with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly taken care of by readers who help them in different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building of its own is to be created, in which we then move into with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support of Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý are performing.
You can find out everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time in the spring of Prague, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would also like to be in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would like to connect this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips in a logistical and organisational way?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, we must of course carry a lot of instrument bags and other luggage...
However, it has always worked out without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than we do, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is totally non-disabled compared to Prague. There it is still unusual when someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural that a wheelchair driver, for example, is provided in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we're after...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the social event there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to start a band?
At that time, I started as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone among other things, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, has been saying, something is out of control (laughs).
But did the band become known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see it outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and etc.
Was it your goal to get it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I felt the potential for dealing with things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is considered with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life if they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just for themselves a progress, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
This is, in my opinion, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have a sample twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Those who have the will and the desire to participate are always welcome to us.
It takes place the day before the predicted world decline, Thursday 20: 2012 at 21: 00
Events are: Incheba-Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live circuit and a common interpretation of the hymn "World Departure falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional disability-based education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiatket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the space authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the Member States of the European Space Agency ESA. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland to space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos were concerned with space, and they did not always come to terms with it.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the presentation by A. Šternfeld of December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to the Cosmonautik."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905), however, left the listeners cold, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky's worldwide contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth's side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway draisin was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisin.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-powered fires.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that the research was advanced to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the technical press of the design of a photo-electric hunting dragon from Ing. Rohoziński showed up, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywobocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasohy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was completed from the start of the war.
Other articles on space were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the research of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation of Space, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Space.
He was a member of the European Parliament until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been a major participant in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first start was on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 in the Błędów desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
= = History = = The first RM-type missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of the missile were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the Committee for Space Research in 1960, which was followed by the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit works.
This decision called for a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unscrupulous financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price increases.
This concept is to be understood as a state in which the producer tries to compete in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
This means, on a large scale, that most companies move their production abroad or buy it in a favourable way, or that they give up their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to replace the social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The inconsiderate practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments spend their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for some years, there have been public food delivery orders for poor people who are no longer able to feed on their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will no doubt be based on the same state of affairs, in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to pay for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question of where this capital comes from is being raised.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, the workers are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim, up to the overpressure, that the state must not take part in its own economy with capital, and that planning will lead to economic disaster.
Private capital is firmly insisting on its position that the state should not be allowed to take a lead in the economy.
But then one must wonder whether private capital does not influence or even guide politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State is responsible for the drafting of draft laws, in the absence of finance, private, close to the industry.
These draft laws are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that the liberal democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has been in decline for a long time and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against bribe money, by illegal leaning of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew uninhibited, and the people went to the election with already bought voices... "" People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline... "" One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected... "Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is not, by its very nature, able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which are not in the least striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from today's state, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, in which the next round already stands.
The fact that today's elites are facing the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and more recent history, is particularly catastrophic.
The abolition of the law on non-profit-making work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore a system-based one.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
... "that nothing can come from violence, or could ever be created," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is:... "so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no war," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who in these ever-recurring waves of killing the guilty and who is the victim; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
I am concerned with opening the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, the look at whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spots of the Middle East are above all useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or which group of people are significantly influencing the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not been created within the scope of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don't know if there's anyone above them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
I understand.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to prevent the connection of its name with highly criminal acts, in which the consolidation of their power, the proliferation of their assets or both was always in the background.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are fighting or are preparing for them (there were 7 countries (before the attack on Afghanistan, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, while Russia has in the meantime subdued its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global desire for power of the Rothschilds in the years 1859 - 1871 led to the formulation of a plan for the unlocking of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would take care of their amenities and their luxury and would not use so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the advance here) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED so that crises such as those which they triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
After the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they managed to trigger the First World War, and destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks' revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unsubstantiated surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire) and the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the opening of the Second World War, the bankers had a latent conflict situation created by the politics, by making Germany with huge war repairs, creating the condition of the armed masses, so that they only had to give the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multiethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on to unfold the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the creation of a Jewish state, possibly on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it first came into conflict with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke out of the chain where the international bankers had initially kept him, or whether everything went according to plan, is only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared for the Second World War by the war repairs against Germany, the exclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victims in the first line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East, similar to the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (one only thinks of how much people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their striving for global power at the beginning?
It is important to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as we, the people, are only making their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician who is loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything he can to open a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly become a global conflict, and which could result in the destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of the world's oil supplies.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its idea, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth to subdue this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich, the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has reason, he who thinks of the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and six. "
The movie Argo: If it's worst to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the delivery of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained the Patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have greatly damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to liberate hostages only made things worse.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been negotiated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home called for a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small victory.
Six staff of the embassy were able to escape immediately before the embassies were occupied.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e. the story of a successful Hussaar piece, such as the movie Ocean's Eleben.
This will change the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs are shown in the title sequence, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overstated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the offices, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after the Crimi No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director removed from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the first storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film team on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the little he works quite successfully, while sometimes he helps something in reality - which then doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport is turned away from a phone call in America, or also the persecution on the runway, seem a little bit curled).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood staff, but their figures would have earned more space, and they are by no means alone in the film.
This makes Affleck's film lose a little bit of traction. It is a film that can be followed with some interest and that can be used to gold the design and the thriller of the 70's.
But it is difficult to see enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that has been living in a certain way to this day and as proof of how overtaken the ideas of the almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who annually calls out a survey of the most absurd bank charges, decided to organise the competition "Absurdeste Regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This was the idea of the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is taking care of the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
The European Court of Justice's judgment on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women, for example, is one of the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women had an advantage in life insurance because they objectively present a lower risk to insurance companies.
"Other incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which are, as a result, harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazard, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also taken on the fact that the use of the term "butter spread" or the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also supported the need for bananas of the highest trading class in the EU to be at least 14 cm long and not to have "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was looking for an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children in the suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market flows.
Curiosis is also available at home
A directive that concerns European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Fair, nominated in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, also the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
For example, the Czech Republic exceeded the set volume for preserved mushrooms, for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement, "said the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU, according to Palas, should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to organise an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funds for applications for funding to the municipalities, in particular the funds for the allocation of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, in the Member States, although regulations are easily the target of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the whole of the European Union, some experts believe that it is more appropriate to recognise.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions here also point to the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky," the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it into "Tuzemák."
The term rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmachinken now also shows up the Karlbader Eunback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can brush.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are being increased by taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm over 40, and I'm independent and unpartisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Is that not how you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself the whole time that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
I later specified this and said that I will be running for the President's office, provided that I am elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence and as much mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that, as a people, we are shuddering in the pub and in front of the TV, but to put down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to take the honor of you, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed to be a journalist or to be a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive statements of assets of over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I was committed to ensuring that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent paramilitary, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without the idea of the drawers and the dogmas of any party.
Do you consider yourself a human being in politics to be more right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important for me that we move on.
I am not concerned with whether anyone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I am always in public support of any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
For my part, this can be called populism, but all the proposals I have been talking about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have keywords.
And that doesn't get you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people only long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would have to say, if necessary, why they are refusing to do so.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things for myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone, so I've been talking to several well-known people about whether they want to run for the Senate.
I spoke, for example, to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenzo, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the elections at all, and the people who left most of the time elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of the mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about the creation of a party of your own?
I have not yet thought about this, because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, and I do not have the money to do so.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account there are only CZK 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about a statement of assets, what do you look like?
I'm guessing my private assets are about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection that is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb that is worth about a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked the way he was driving in the car, being galant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably does not raise too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So are you going to continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your way out?
Didn't you say you were going to return these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partly driven back my activities.
For example, in the spring my deputy becomes the managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a samaritan to save the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What month's income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, I would, however, completely stop my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bucherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the street side.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going to one of those old-style libraries on a voluntary basis today, right?
Spijkenisse, a small town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-population community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges shown on the euro notes as a pretty pinned steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the great-bodied bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the thing with common serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in in the face.
And while the jury still dusk around and twitched with the armpits, the cheeky Maas stacked his read-in of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist-based speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bucherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain was spilled.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town resort, which up to now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and an unbeatable ugly town hall, behind which white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to richer a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: book eldorado under cheese lock.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain mass, but the true space and reading pleasures are open when the topography is on the rise.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns speak clearly the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the book shelves are located along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on the head and the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The inside of the library is well used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and home technology centre are located in the middle.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes brushing, sometimes stingers.
Optics, haptic and smell are foreign.
Even flicked architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so, in a peaceful agricultural holding, one day, we met a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two saisons, after which it is ripe for the plywood.
For the library, the fleece was pressed to four centimeters thick plates - for the first time in these quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit like new car and a bit like sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre long walk you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and topped-up ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the correct humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a showcase project in the field of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, the sun itself on sunny days seems only short inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as a coating and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be fully automatic.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptical from the IT industry, already dared to go to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg a "long overdue soul."
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical gaps are to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the ornament.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in the king's discipline, which is called the identity foundation in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing to a narrow diplomatic degree.
German Wave: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up an air ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy which, as it were, was managed by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
It is also difficult for Europeans to have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore found between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still having an impact on their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It certainly does matter.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstain in the vote on important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it does signal that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly expressed its support for a veto.
Are there any differences between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama, in secret, has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so much enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on the one hand its close relations with Israel and the US, and on the other hand the position of the main partners in the EU?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not, of course, easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany consider itself to be an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a hard role to play?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, different anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence on European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling up at the moment of this vacuum, who else is staying there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, also known as Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a very officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it is protected as long as the real namesakers do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're gonna get it right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
A new case ends up on my desk every week.
A few additional letters are already available to the impersonators so that they can register their brands.
This is how Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in the injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are multi-storey stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger's brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
That means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the single position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive high-quality products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
But deletion of dubious entries in the brand register is difficult to reach and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can go on, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court of First Instance rejected actions because, after the long duration of the contested name, it had become "market reality."
If the plaintiff's bad luck, he would even have to pay the plagiarism for violating his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use until today an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that was reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against copycat from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO trade mark office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
In the past year, however, the "emergency situation in the work process has returned to normality."
For example, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, the Office still has 81,500 objections to the discharge.
To deal with it costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This was a record and meant that China, for the tenth time in a row, has introduced the list of new applications all over the world, the Authority shall inform.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, a total of 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
Simplified, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To deal with this, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal production of imitated parts of the motor vehicle was eliminated.
But the copycat continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was not the case, as in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office of CTMO therefore rejected the opposition of the Münchner.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
You have to watch the hell out.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely complicated and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated that the company archive had even had to look through one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to go back to Europe.
That is, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The group has long given up this business, yet it was able to refuse registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights, rather, the foreigners should "report anything that is in any way protective in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was under the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other side licence fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we're being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir is rehearsing imbongi - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen are happy about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the bar on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly swinging - old, bass, tenor and soprano - and they are harassing, behaving and following.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes, when he brings them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
The 50 singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetician to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are about 34 million HIV infected around the world, which Unaids estimates is the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
= = References = = = = External links = =
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association has found Voices for Africa Patten in Germany.
70 of them are visiting a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praise laureates.
The language of the banquet can speak fluently in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally come from: to the South of Africa.
For 8 733 km from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore, because they are killed by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni there is a small one, which all of Swaziland is sick of: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Abbreviations of the male foreskin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not a rarity.
On a common Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only lacking parental care, but simply in everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa," which since then almost professionally takes care of the Aids orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STI are HIV, human papilomaviras, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydiene infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human papilomaviras are commonly occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet: around 20 percent of the new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydic infections are much more common among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Humane papilomaviras are also common in young people in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of HIV reinfections has been declining since 2007.
= = References = = = = External links = =
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sex disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, urination symptoms, outflow, abdominal pain, and bubbles or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricants and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in the case of often changing sex partners.
The most STI can be cured early and late results can be avoided.
By patenting, donations and not least the gages that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and strong woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school lessons.
Whoever has no one, comes to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman, who is paid by the association as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is in the whole country, it is best to keep it quiet.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, it's strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned form of life is also due to the fact that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
To promote cultural exchange, the imbongi choir travels through the South of Africa every two or three years together and sings songs full of agony, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know at the southern peak of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already taken away some of the grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test room on the Bergheimer street, you can see it also there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice ceiling may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice deck in the planet's permanently shaded region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that are on the Mercury.
No one is associated with the finding of ice, however, with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the earth: small gazeholes in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera that has developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: the oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has recorded the spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slipped out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid mist, 5400 light years from the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
The Nasa's spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Plejade cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the helix fog on this infrared photo looks at the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent brought the title of North America to this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular colour.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How they were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European South Observatory shows the several thousand light-years away trifide fog in the constellation Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-split), since dark dust strips are the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of serpent carriers, astronomers have photographed the progeny of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years away from the earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are racing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them in their nickname Southern fire wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the Irish Bible in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away mist consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined with optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy called scientists UGC 1810.
In this star mist is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new young stars.
This star cloud, connected with the rosette fog, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mainly able to find hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo used it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows a view of space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the favourable construction: the telescope is fixed in its height angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light collection force.
In fact, despite the relatively low mirror diameter, this is sufficient to that of the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the space after alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all the credit.
With a total of four mirrors, the long-range tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters - and to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes were considered the largest in the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, next to them, still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions of space, however, provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - especially those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be shot into space on board an Ariane5 missile until 2018.
The primary level of the space-infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that ice is also available at the southern pole of the Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 - the first to circle around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and becoming 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is called wild dromantic.
The small bus tramples over the curvature road, past densely wooded hills, ripening rivers and simple farms.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian people of the Talys live, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian as well as Ashish and are very long-lived.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town protzes with too much of an architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 km you need eight hours, because the road is only one track.
The great wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Long Life, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep's shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is to have become 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was still a daughter.
So has Şirali Müslümov calculated his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard from the high-ranking in Central Asia.
"There are a lot of high-age people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since there were no records of the status of persons.
Butter melted every day
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-level people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijan travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
But that the calorie-rich taste of the talys should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, milk products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem to be quite plausible from a food-scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cenmiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a box of butter that rolls her back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of them are long old grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can make tea to the guests, which is served in the typical, building-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in a row and a link, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde pots that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what was from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food in the supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son, Ilham, took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grieved son is right: "The old are in our culture to be respected."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian President did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but in particular to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they all, so far unhopelessly disagreed in a confusional opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of Grace of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, as Mohammed Mursi said almost apologizing, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its powers to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of South California, really wants to save, about which are the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Are you going to get rid of the jedicative?
In fact, the 234 articles that the Islamist dominated 100-head constitutional assembly in a night-time, 15-hour parforcerite, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the bold wording and the legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: in all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiant power, had to be consulted throughout the whole of Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that spirituality oversees legislation, which would de facto result in the dissolution of the judiciary.
A lot of the draft Constitution is an interpretation.
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the collapse of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it is in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote its morals and values. "
This is legally so insensitive that government institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this purpose, another forbids or denies the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The same dubios also makes the phrase that the "insult of people" is forbidden.
Is there a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The interpretation, like so much in the draft that Mursi is to be signed and, according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the power of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual way on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring the Charter down before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-party candidate of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft Constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History."
Through short-term news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet settled," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew up to counter-demonstration, but for the most part not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the Cairo University.
Many disguised women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They said to Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the highness over the symbolic Tahrir square, where everything began, would probably have brought up civil war-like conditions.
That's obviously not what Mursis's followers wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide by the ballot, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even happen"
Haarez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have actually gone by February and involved all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or were in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their belief in the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President is de facto devoting it," says Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You feed a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most obnoxious fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-looking fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sports clothes.
And leave them there for a week.
You have to imagine the nasal-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a trout with salt, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinking you would like to be.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norway is going to be a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very exhilarating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as so-called "Rakfisk-General" also hosts the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can remove the smell.
I'll cost you a few.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk close to the nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has a very long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then taken out after long fermentation and, without doubt, consumed with the help of alcohol-dampened senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was far more rich than Norway a long time ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it to the world press, and most people do not seem to mind.
Here you still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you only refer to the "incident of July 22."
Norwegian are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes the round tablets with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Your English, like most people here, is impeccable.
We're not very adamant, we don't like bravery.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years to the world economic crisis all of them were throwing money around them, Norway was holding its purse closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with a clear smile.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is on the menu again.
The hotel in which I logistics is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-dressed showmaster, surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the heavy thirst of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges he is facing and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-blocked city, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which locks several important routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will be given the presidential ties and will take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," said Pena Nieto in the Oval Office to US President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
He was the Governor of Mexico, and the President of the United States, and the President of the United States.
In this densely populated, large part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
The inhabitants of the holiday resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways that Pena Nieto had built and which represents a great improvement to the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plates with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to have real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party has made great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The opposition's allegations, the new president's lack of substance, he rejected.
He was a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He was an excellent statesman, but above all he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico-City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was engaged in the fight against drug trafficking in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of brachland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downhill area, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed that her body was washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the morgue had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this is exactly what the family said, it has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a snitch, a troublemaker, a Nörgler.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's binding on Saturday, he will also take on a great deal of responsibility.
Ten thousand Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes in the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as he was as governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence is seeking to reject the charge due to harsh conditions of arrest
The release of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor's office tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Manning during a court hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that there were no complaints about his treatment for weekly visits to prison officials during the nine-month period of detention in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of an application by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been punished enough by the hard time - Manning had declared that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army's secret service analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had completed during their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had served under increased conditions of arrest from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole as "very professional."
The forms, "Fein," did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though the officials had questioned Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but they had not been logged.
"They wrote down (after discussion of the concerns)" No problems, "and that did not necessarily mean that I did not say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months before on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status for the "prevention of injuries."
The military said that it has assigned him this restrictive status - which is one step under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning declared his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained about two months before being transferred to the Naval Base Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered the suicide and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what was going on with him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a ceiling, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to stay in motion, because by the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He had to sleep all the time with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards couldn't see his face, he was raised to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning for an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this count.
At the interview on Friday, Manning said that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling he could have covered himself with. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detainees and drastically reduce his degree of imprisonment, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess to a lower level of crime, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the terms of the arrest.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the promotion of the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when the intellect was spreading in me.
Shields referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which one I should go to.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mexicans."
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later on, I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for any cuts or bindings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim to be in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do not get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans are now as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block on the basis of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States came to Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership to leave more than half of its territory in a pretentious struggle.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a US government official is even the only one who has the mildest criticism of Mexico, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country, you will hear complaints about how the Americans are harming the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which it does not do so.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or large parent part - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may be living the American dream, visiting good schools and getting good jobs, we must never forget that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In her opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally entering the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans dislike them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one country nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in it.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico that represent their interests in the United States.
We are to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and to put pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties to Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated just not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have been hit near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this process.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly paternity situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, this week's fighting has strengthened the hard-shot on both sides.
Hamas's leader, the Islamist movement, which has been in control of the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his group itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being infused in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah, is increasing.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power, once considered to be Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken over for the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jealous Hamas followers believe that an Islamic half-moon is formed around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels could stand before the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the most inhabited and most important Arab country - on the southern side of Israel has changed the balance of the region in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is weakened with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor, which cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw a opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States is holding on to its position. Many European countries have held Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Banyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockages that are going into the West Bank and thus to the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal to the world, but which are still being developed.
Netanyahu is in good shape. His Likud party joined an even more fighting group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these defiant Palestinians also encroach and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their fellow leaders in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in control behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab spring could make a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi is meeting Barack Obama to achieve a truce could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think for the longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking gentle steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only get worse.
Bluefin missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a start from the outside
The right answer is the one represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states in which Israel is a security agent.
The hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give the outlying greater influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the exchange of land and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must help to get Israel to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he was just as opposed to participation.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and parts of the body on neutral green packages that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green covers, which are also printed with drastic pictures, which show sick body parts and children with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small writing, will be on Saturday.
In this way, Australia is introducing the world's most stringent tobacco packaging rules.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will no longer start with 99% probability after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that, for example, have shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeits will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette house and silicone caps to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago in the top Australian Court of Justice to challenge the laws.
Zico had sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale trade and was waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the problem of the popularity of social media lies with the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop spending cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to apply for their products do not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health-care researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "very normal people."
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a chicken and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, an operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves okay, that's it, we close it," he adds visibly furious.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored too
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts into boredom.
I don't want to lie.
To wait half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be bored on occasion.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thinking, which may promote creativity.
And since most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively up-to-date phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompejis adorned a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, says that the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job, but not being able to do so."
As a result, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no need to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists of a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing."
It makes boredom sound almost the same as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Uncommitted Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - for example: "The Inactive Mind: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention," published in September in the "Perspectives on Psychological Science" magazine, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television indicated that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems of concentrating, could not find a reason for it and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or exhausting task, the lack of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one-way activity is carried out - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, we can even fight it by keeping people more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a daring speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of long-term vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida - in particular as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the young people were bored in the school and when they did the homework, while 23% indicated that they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
He was, however, sure that "youth is felt to be particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily lives.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case, it results in people taking extreme physical risks and losing the gambling or drugs to ease them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that something else should be done," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
When you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you get happy.
However, television can make it feel lucky in the short term, but it will disappear in the long term.
So if an iPad is enough for his bored child, it can be removed from the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transmits from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our aim should be to feel well beyond the constant activity and technology guidance.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the painful, unwavering desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for one way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy once the noise is stopped."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south-east of Colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana wrecks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavaliers' offences, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana to its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misconduct that revolves around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small-scale property, which is allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that they will continue to follow up existing marijuana acts and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads off.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority for Spirituals in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a coarse guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and thus also form the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist but is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis business within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis," a recent research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora saying that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek "from now on" any criminal evidence for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban rules for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and that drug dealers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County, North Colorados, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stronger view.
After the vote, he said that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
At present 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many were also charged with other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer indicate adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound gap among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District state lawyers are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the accused in court of marijuana acts and acts on the ground as a spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for the fact that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national cases of drug legalization.
While interlocutors and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also waiting for instructions from the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Speakers of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several supervisory arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to a large extent.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government, believes that while criminal officers are likely not to enter the door to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be in a position to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local local authorities approved Moratoria for new marijuana shops, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we can license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We focus on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university that I once considered to be the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I had left because I had a problem with the fact that commandos had sex in the next room.
The author A N Wilson, in a way, said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink out of damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I was harassed - a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my father Woodrow Wyatt, who was now dead, had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports say a new generation of students of moderate rights are suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same level of equality that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwelcome because of their political views."
They call for a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which Tories represented as an eccentric and neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, by the former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and protched with a silver-coloured suit and a silver-filled walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, the president of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university voted not to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even startled Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste for the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the South African apartheid regime found their way into the woodland areas of the tutorium.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty hairy.
"Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?," he asked me.
The other students were giggling.
In my eyes, tears turned up.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," I was curious about Pitt.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was in college alone at dinner when someone was easy to tap on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year, James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory is being forced.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester pretend to be a member of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried to change my mind later.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all the points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in the field of philosophy, politics and economics who had, ironically, visited the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How are Tory's sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded after the fall of the darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years before me, before my spiritual eye, extended to a purgatory of contempt and isolation.
The only tutor to be able to identify himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but also for consulting Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for him.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed to be infidels.
During his time in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do that, not in my city of the dream tower tips.
Even my communist friends have always shown perfect manners.
His moist eyes were dazzling.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nailed.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhaust by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory-followers, had given in to the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial in the next week, where another history mentor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly disgust of shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing," and called her "old fool."
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes, my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a wine-like dick.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is still hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture were made by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stticky and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't put their chicken out on your beautiful carpet, like some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marbella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model," which began their career at the 1995 Haute Couture week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she finally says.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, more of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60-metre-long treadmill, which suggested a roll-out: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the treadmill to admire a dream "audience" that is wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like those of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg are radiant.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Nasty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s it finally came to that.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that makes his name an honor.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care," "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the related memories."
The "King" of fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called its neighbours) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "Savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, commander of the Arts et of the Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, has the highest number of honors in Garavani, as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I've always noticed his affinity, his peace, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was impeccable; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Antoine Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this purpose, he must go down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas that flows out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the shredded paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises up to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the tortoise, while keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur that they dismantle.
At the top, they train the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mine company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who, since 1960, has been using the presence in the volcano and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours to complete it, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euro) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an inhumane effort is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day at the coffee farm and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a wall on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-driven young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
challenging the shadow, he rises into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers charge the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the reduction of sulphur in order to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) supplement per photo machine that the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro), demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals, not for the human being," protesting Madrisin, a dubious 42-year-old carrier who has been working at the Kawah Ijen school for three decades since leaving the school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and is assured that he will continue "as long as he can," because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes are itchy, when the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers are stuck in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one is complaining about serious diseases... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, with his 53 years of age, is now in a position to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years of age.
Time is passing, but poverty is continuing generation-to-generation in one of the world's toughest professions: those who work as human lastiness on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore are blaming them for not having children, for the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the education of children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us complete our civil duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a commercial for minzbonbons, but still - or precisely because of it - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "sliding a" bao "(Laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which made the video, has the hope that the advertising will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil their "national duty."
This is something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we reproduce, so we realized that this is a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as we can to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue easily are the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has made it possible for people to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to prevent the reduction of the population has led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the uncashed xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" which may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Son, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger living units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
It admits, however, that the new standards give the developers more clear guidelines, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the discussions with the Singapore people working in the financial district show that they will not have a major impact.
"People are heavily stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out of many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about 20 years old.
Men and women lead their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singapore people have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he makes public on the Internet situations he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term "something very own" to the personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I would not reveal my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also taking my time with my acquaintances.
"I would not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just gonna load it up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
He was asked to answer that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone felt a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any indication or asked him about his address or phone number.
"If anyone pushes me or asks me to, I simply remove him from my user account," he admits.
José signed up to ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to secure a user account.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe him one out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, says that in order to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of the social networks to be informed.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; however, with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale, and author of the work "Digital Native and Immigrants," formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them, where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what can be spread, published or said, at an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky when it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it, not to work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if you published a photo of you, like the one you published by a friend?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you label photos of parties?
And one more question: does everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them the understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should be signed in theory by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's office initially announced that they would pass it on after the ceremony, however, stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in a brief statement.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information that was circulating among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unassur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused the inconvenience of the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who asked for more information.
After that, the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the III. South America-Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was also not published on this occasion, despite the press's strong call.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were available, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which will resolve a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which began on Monday in The Hague to listen to the pleads of both sides in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Convention after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousoff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the withdrawal of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The welcoming President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the lunchtime in Lima.
The Head of State read the final document, in which it reported that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will "take important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be encouraged to "improve cooperation in the fight against city insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on any triumphant traits, but should be used to increase our production performance and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the spatial links in South America and, in particular, in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian, located on the cross-axes of its area from the coast to Brazil, two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to restore it in the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting, that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to deal with the maritime conflict in respect of a judgment of the IGH that Bogotá had called into question.
"Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Group's defence ministers met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is in the chair at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "are today practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would drive the Member States of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA), with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an example of the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but that he had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there were "justified assumptions at the time that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that its proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticised the Swedish justice that he had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
However, there was a risk that he would take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a narrow room and could not perform physical outdoor exercises.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to asylum granted to Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June was the granting of a letter of release to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the locked-up founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has a number of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
And "if the United Kingdom will grant this free letter tomorrow, I think it will be done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or about Skype, how it allowed Swedish case law and was done in other cases, the problem was resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that defends freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to win and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists "and not by the bankers or the hegemonic and impeccable countries," and took the lead that he would "deepen the revolution in a re-election to continue the way in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism must "remain hard and not allow any opportunism or a coup in law" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which promoted the maritime authority of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the sea-law borders between the two countries, is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in a comprehensive way so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies when both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he would see this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must respect that responsibility," he said.
If I was to win, it would be my last period as President, then I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who has told me that he has travelled to Cuba for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the state of the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State in Lima today took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death because of AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he got the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the occurrence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is receiving treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent would have greater opportunities: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
In simple terms, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 can in this sense "easily become 75 years old as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA's annual report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died since the occurrence of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year, it is already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that universal access to the antiretroviral medicinal products has been available since 2005.
So why are people still dying of it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that the people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are needed, which is why it is necessary to offer massive recognition tests to all people who need it."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State AIDS Prevention Committee in Jalisco) agree with this proposal and also the patients such as Fabrizio who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it was a friend of him who, despite his young age, had already been in the AIDS phase and even had the Kposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the drugs.
All his parents know today is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should do the test when they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between the health programmes and the simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is to prevent it.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the risk zones for new infections are young people.
"What do you need it for?" is a widespread mockery of social workers, guidance workers in schools, in pharmacies and in the health system, which young people do not want to sit down, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table, but should be in public toilets in facilities that are often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether it would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
In national terms, the state is in fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection are caused by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro group reached through a trade agreement in Mexico, an incurable precedent will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, in contrast to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are helpless in confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States' bankruptcy law, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, says that the main proceedings are the trade market in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in non-payment procedures of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute being used as a bad guy.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy class that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority necessary for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Federal Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Competition) among companies in the group.
It is also true that after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vultures funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not reach a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a beat.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same appeal court in order for the vote to take place in plenary, that is, by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not the case, the Ceriorare appeal shall be lodged, which shall request the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The main thing about this case is that the Court of First Instance left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro in the framework of the Law on Trade Competition, and which points out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, to the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow to the country and to the country.
General balance
After several months of non-progress by the Mexican air trade unions against the former owner of Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindic de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The request put forward by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
The supervisory authority then systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the trader in order to remove 198 million pesos from Bank IXE's trust account F / 589 in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrora Profsional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain of Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to set up a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry) has achieved the unification of the governors in the south-east in order to oppose the monumental facility, which partly destroyed protected areas and was the mother of all the industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the opportunity to consider them as a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is putting on the market more than 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four of the same issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competition
Founded from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the leading information technology company, a group of companies under the name of Competition was set up, the purpose of which is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummer of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, agents and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"All my life, I have put up many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was the president of the BSN, the head of the national team and the president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered on a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated and testified with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-manager or manager of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as the managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best shooters.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gaasse would take care of another.
He was granted the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top place of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After that, the 1990 World Cup, where we took the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not that Canadian referee, who made us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Panamanian Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won the bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team not only included Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which made us very happy was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events at the Panamanian games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s to 17 teams in one season.
What else you got to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and first meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, treacherous and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" is a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were in Dallas with him for the celebration of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone happy who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swing," Gray said in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he was undergoing a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman became known on television as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the NBC TV station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comodies, which were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work on the film included well-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing-Clan and other figures in the area was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising saying "Who shot J.R.?," which should create the expectation for an episode of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in contests.
The series thus reached a show record at that time.
When the answer was published in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swung her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a defiant businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcohol-sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) notified.
"I know what to say on J.R. 's tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts for us who have been lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TDT TV channel a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT on how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many famous people live.
In 2001, he made his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I thought could hurt someone or hurt him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the most afraid patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are coming and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also fought against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The beginning of the courses that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long back-count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," and a growing conflict with Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apocalyptic semester that there has ever been," Charmé said this week to the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds me that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer this semester, which should be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world."
In Temple, the accompanying Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a co-chair of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World."
"We do not accept 2012, so that we always keep the option of reholding the course, in case the world does not go down," Restall said.
Despite the "coming downfall," students must study, create projects and take part in final audits.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than to "continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more places in two hours," Restall said about his high-average course for students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places to go.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect- or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and care explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where it is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculation.
"People don't think otherwise," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or about philosophied that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to celebrate about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
