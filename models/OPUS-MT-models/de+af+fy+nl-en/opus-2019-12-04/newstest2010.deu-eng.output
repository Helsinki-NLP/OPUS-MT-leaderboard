Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth President of the United States in history.
He also receives the diploma, the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North-West metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five members of the Committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony where Obama will take over the prestigious prize.
He receives it as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in the office.
The White House was already airing that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when the prize is taken over.
The President does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he will take the prize as a President who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He said, for example, that he has the feeling that he does not deserve the price completely.
He also repeated that the price is not only for him, but for all who seek the same values as him.
As soon as he was notified, he said that this was "a call to action."
Nature Protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the citizens' association "Leitmeritz Naturschutzgemeinschaft" for extortion.
In a number of cases, he appealed last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from investors in his favour, said the Leitmeritz police speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeintiger Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's under threat of a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the Sortier dumpsters again on the step and step.
And in Brno?
There you should reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council leaders are not taking sufficient care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because, as a citizen, we are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all by the number of tonnes of waste for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket in the center?
This is art, it takes time and a lot of nerve before all.
The only place I've found so far, by chance, is the Moravian Square in front of the Married Gans.
Mr Unterka, let us not let his colleagues get upset, but that seems far too little to me.
In addition to the fact that the waste separation is not a honey slackening in other parts.
All the rows of my friends would rather not sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to the garbage tons for them.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles even after the party.
But on the Konicova road, I did not see any dyes in sight.
I was lucky to get in the right place when I was on the tram.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They would rather buy the city an ice hockey league that would embarrass us all over the Republic rather than buy a few more garbage tons and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics, after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-Kom, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and officials, the budget no longer contains money for pensions, health care and construction business.
But not for the state debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This will cause more problems to those who will be at the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the S & Ds and Communists put in place the wage increase for some groups, they expected the government to add the money to the sensitive expenditure, pensions or health care. "This is just a delay in the problems to the future," says Janota.
The loans are actually paying higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, from where, the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state business are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
People don't have to be afraid of the pensions or the sickness benefits from which 1.8 billion have disappeared from their account, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes even more - in the next year not only 163 billion will be missing, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will thus increase faster and faster and, together with it, the cost and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money as the government made in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the money laundering in favour of some of the population groups, there will also be five billion in the next year for the development of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections obtained in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and may be reduced.
This is not free of charge.
This means the delay or the cessation of thirty large buildings, which is also at risk of the use of Europe's money, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it dissolves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay for the damage to the environment, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the non-level of 5.7% of GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
It is not certain whether the state can handle it without that money.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international court case, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota will make it clear.
The Minister must then save the money internally or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the two-million-dollar project "Staatskasse," which is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans are counting on a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of the virtual software for the computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware indicated during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test model to journalists with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran in parallel.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are to come to the customer within the year 2012.
Snow angels on the mountains tortures the hotel owners
Sneelless slopes do not only care to the giant mountain residents.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering the ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," the operator of the information sport Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want to stay in the spindle mill in the New Year's Eve, you should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save and the quality of your stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think that they will try to sell it for a while, but then they will have to give in and go to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Scheiefert, said.
The New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Scheifert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizonz in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in January, and in February the business will also be well run, the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
It was a pleasure to surprise us this year in January, for which we are already occupied about 60 percent.
A little bit weaker is now February, but at the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly also increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall it should be on the mountains snow.
After that, Jiri Jakubsky was informed of the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Replay is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny with which student-pursuit Barack Obama, the president with his call of the clutches, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself thought was the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly expected Afghanistan doctrine, it was shown that he wrote it off three years ago from the Busch-Iraq scenario via the copy paper.
Not only did he use the term "as in Iraq" in the text himself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path" without scoffing.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea of sending fresh troops to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as "irresponsible and in the conclusions of the war."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which was based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and so far very successful that the news about Iraq was no longer spoken at all today.
The call of Bush was not improved, because objectively he left a much more grateful starting situation to his successor than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military have again asked him to increase the force, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination habits, strongly criticised the shaming shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he cheated on the General Wenistens for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he originally expected at least 10,000.
The whole Obama strategy is very problematic, its intention is to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brother war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally set up correctly, will remain only the sham buildings behind which patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the incomprehensibility of the conditions that further complicate the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "viable state," which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only continued to deteriorate and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
The small soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a really romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is a little too low.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu-mountain suburbs.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians are not effective, the United States will have a very serious question as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is going to Obama for the withdrawal of the winner from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to reach another strategy if it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs' managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which thus responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case of excessive risk.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is the head of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism, after putting aside almost $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to the Reuters Agency, even despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, the United Kingdom reported that it intends to tax the bankers' bonuses that exceed £25,000 with a 50% tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women in Stockholm today took over this year's Nobel Prize in the specialist categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustalt.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The award for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the enlightenment of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have carried this prize for research in the glass fibre sector and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of the purchase of the money.
This is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
According to tradition, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He recognised in his speech the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the head of the country that has two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus will be receiving the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree to the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the subject of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Raram Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on his further stay in his office.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
However, on Wednesday, Parliament voted on the left-wing party proposals on money laundering and increased the money for public servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has stopped the Social Democracy proposals that it has covered up the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has therefore arisen, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as was accepted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishing government in the autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end the public debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the State Budget Act, said today, at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs, that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem" which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget was terrible and that the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS position president, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
In the editorial group, Prime Minister Fischer referred to words similar to "strong statements."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was terrible that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and that was above 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD considered the approval of the state budget for the next year to be a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows a lot of the country, of which the fight and victories, despite some reviews, were held by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of American Oscar actors, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to present him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another important role.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby," was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he finally became a slave-holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but rarely a person who is still alive and important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak how he
The film is a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. New President Mandela knows that his people are still in a racial and economic division after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players that are one of the outsiders in the world.
Finally, the South African team is going up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema.
He had no other objective than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
It's important to me to have become another person.
Matt Damon is the captain of the national rugby team in the film François Pienaar, where the white players have considered it.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang to the door bell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real models, he has received "Invictus: Unbeaten" positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety sheet, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good history, very well-performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again, and the rocket, called the type "Bulava," which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as about a "rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atom submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the launch of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undefined flying object over the north was actually the damaged "Bulava."
In addition, the Norwegian have not been in doubt since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has kept itself from it this time and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the Ministry of Defence's management only considers six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and so it continues to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly without problems and even carry up to ten hypersound nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenseman Vjaceslav Fetisov again presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of 40, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas has been injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, and he was a co-player, Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty and a total of 15 matches and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he won the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the trade unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
The union announced the willingness to strike on Monday because of the often ordered overtime.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company has offered the employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff will also receive it in the afterward for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
They can either be paid the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the ticket and lunch.
With due regard to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of trade union claims and complaints that had stopped production last week, the management decided with immediate effect yesterday afternoon on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
The employees of the car factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
As soon as the agreement is signed, the trade unions will withdraw the willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are to be concluded on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree on the fulfilment of the claims and can sign a common document, they would be prepared to lift the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory was on the increase when about 400 employees spontaneously attacked for continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held that the employees had to do overtime to meet the car delivery needs.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday strike call that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be subject to any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for the reduction of overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
Up to this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in 'stolen' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact is against the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong the combination of drugs and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your take is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of sg. Resistant viruses, against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarbs have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarbs are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus proliferation in a way other than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarbs have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages that consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Proud and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-protease-induced HIV virus division, there would be no mature virus particles.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus's proliferation in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report, which was published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarbs on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, which are often without effect.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical design, makes the metalcarboreans interesting links for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight for the budget. ODS started on fishermen who resisted
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "cruel" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister referred to the statement of the ODS as "strong statements."
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Civil Service Office, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer work.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the growing deficit, or whether he is about his stay in office with the help of the Members.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, and that is what Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with proposals for amendments to the Left Party, more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for public servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has stopped the Social Democracy proposals that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the revised budget is also just a less bad version of the budget budget.
Disillusion and senseless
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has talked about his disappointment and a sense of senseless, against which Prime Minister Jan Fischer has mentioned that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up for the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He suggested that he should consider his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget's negotiations.
The extent to which fishermen are in favour of the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that it will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sickness and pensions or the new law on services.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a vice-function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he is supposed to be unable to count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I have not thought about it, and if that is the case, then I will deal with it, the Minister for Defence, nominated by the citizens, Martin Bartak, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister expressly asked the Members of the Ombudsman to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not seem to be an orphan, we are not little children, then he answered the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As I did not have the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, in particular, the Bolsheviks of Parliament and the destruction of the House would be all positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will drive for about the same price.
The Czech railway will end or limit a few less equipped fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new road map compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer travel tariffs are not changed.
For example, several links to the capital are provided to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, and the railway is used for this route by trains of the type Pendolino.
The fast train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also drive on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but it can look forward to an increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the most important changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice must now move to Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth traffic route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will drive in the distance of two hours.
With the pendolino the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's account for regional railway: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive four billion kroner in the next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, just like this year. The local trains will provide the districts, and they will pay eight billion kroner in the next year, with the state offering three billion kroner.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has reconcluded a ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway is commending the system, and perhaps it did not take the opportunity to increase the price of the large majority of the tickets.
There are only changes for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the road, so far it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine Millitante captures more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary schools and their teachers.
This was the case with the AFP agency, which initially informed only about 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was taken in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants were supposed to use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now working on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the Millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police were following the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was related to the election to the Board of Governors, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of taking part in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government were resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American movies "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life history of the former President of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the start of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar Prize and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Big expectations are put in the film because he comes to the movies at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are culminating, but at the same time the media are shaking the world's public with frightening news about the increasing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being positive, despite many reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamt of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
On several occasions I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in the interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to bring this film to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a South Africa story, but it affects every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united portrays the South African human rights advocate in his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, is trying to bring together two racial and, for years and years, intersected groups, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays his role in the South African National Rugby Dress, which at the time won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela gained great ovations 14 years ago, mainly from the white audience, and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to join the people into a single people, the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, such as in recent interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Great Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchboard near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - foam and special materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal shortcut.
No one was injured, the Havarie was not at risk, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, and the damage will only be measured after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, they added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the speaker of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingorova, and the fire of the tram station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the control system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy to distribution system and cable line with a length of 4339 km.
Jancura is in charge of slander against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Raram Jancura, is now in charge of slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The case is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, and we only made the offer about the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
There is nothing left to us but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all the districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with the law of the Council of Europe.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be a further continuation of the Jancura media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call for further leaders to do so.
I assume that in this matter too, it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional passenger transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the negative step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was going to stop the campaign after Christmas, and that he was going to continue the campaign after New Year's.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura, after the districts agreed on the operation of the regional railway transport with the Czech railway and did not sign up for the order in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vocura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was, if we do not give up, that we can also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, today Jancura told the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Implantation against pneumococci will change the living from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, voices are reporting that duty vaccination would be more effective.
Cultivate the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci.
The medical institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance is required to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has started the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for the re-vaccination itself.
The first dose must be given between the third and fifth months of the child's life.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci last year.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In general, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses will spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save on the treatment the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's area vaccination.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle-ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have killed up to 28 children up to 10 years of age, following an examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
From January this is to be paid by the insurance and voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Citizens' Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the duty vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting Pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to enforce at least that.
I think that's the way we need to go now, leading Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman, Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children had been vaccinated, then one could think about the reduction in the number of repeat vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Mr Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination to be paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention, so that they save for further treatment, grabs Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, involves a concern of the practical pediatricians who are concerned with the purchase of the vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance would "get the money out of the health insurance system."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance to pay them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That's not gonna be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazeta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazeta was caught with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings to his vehicle.
They say Frank Frazeta junior and another man used a excavator to get into the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazeta Senior is famous for his depiction of images such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazeta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police declaration, the agency reported that Frazeta Junior was instructed by his father to "enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency informed that Frank Frazeta was disputing Senior to grant any permission.
Labour Defends Etat and Tax Increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously by reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer was also under attack for targeting low and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public pay-as-you-go for 2011.
Social security
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low-wage workers are being punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of imminent "problems."
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
TYPES OF THE PROPOSAL EAST REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 per year will be £110 richer.
Ministers said that their target of the deficit reduction by 2013 was "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be paid to the 5% of top-earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denied that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone."
"These are great figures. They will bring us the deficit halving, and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth - which influence the level of new debt and the speed of the deficit removal - were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to fall by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be at £3 billion higher than before.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years was untenable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan to repay it and press "cynically" against difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They did not say anything important about what they are going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do so, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are kept from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit reduction coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that is generated by the tax increases and the stops will be used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that some at the time of the announcement - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April - would suspend the treasurer from the accusation of the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only take place in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Studies said that the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins it," Roger Bootle added, business consultant at the Deloitte audit company.
"This was only the hollow preliminary report. The markets recognize that."
FBI is investigating "arrests of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens for the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men that were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani origin, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that are accused of them and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police have already been interested in the house before and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest road protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people were given prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuses and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Penal Institute.
But since then, there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"Wrong confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and the protest against the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head, threatening me with death, and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half-unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty reported.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in the prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 other weeks.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to examine the government's unrest after the election and response, but that Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the results that would have been obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, Skihang was set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competitive track.
The ski slopes of this parking event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Awards were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night the snow is left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on building minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written and integrated a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularisation societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French do not love headgear" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a question of dispute that the country shared and occupied for a decade and a half and the effects of which are still to be felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic Free Spaces."
He is a good listener, he gives up discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media is engaged in.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly disagreed with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, which is in connection with Saudi Arabia - who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French policy-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of the Church and the state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He is more likely to see a "tightening of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comforting view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the new open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural story of the icon of the North, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice."
Divided in the complicated history and politics of rolling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the sea, who only fought with the flask of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, the zoo still has a million of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although in Norway, America and Russia it is prohibited to lay down in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm guns in helicopters and motor-sleigh-driving inuit to get their prey to the ground.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century had for the first time shown the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting degree of undercarriage.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but a lot is still achieved by unafraid people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice that is formed by salt water rinsals that are pressed together during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice is once passed, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us."
Marine infanterists were among the 6,000 who laid down in Arlington kranze
De'Angello Robinson, who was the top-level of the party, travelled by bus for seven hours to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infanterists, who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they took.
In a few months, from wherever we're being brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that were us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the funeral company Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also set up a non-profit organization, Wreats Across America, which has also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 kranze on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, at the graves of the National Peace Court Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines' Memorial for Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation for the second time spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
The volunteers walked across the extensive lawn areas and hills of the cemetery, packed in warm clothes.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hand while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where the main veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Some wept open, others prayed and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white space cards that had been put in the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's grave.
She went 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Navy-French underofficer David Shane Spicer, who was in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the US government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government that sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternative Inc. with its headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US's representative of interest in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the accusation of "danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, which often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy places emphasis on the fact that the United States will be in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give you any more information on the arrest.
The arrest and the detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch," which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same as Cuba," a reference to the use of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and arrested within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, especially at the time when both countries are moving towards more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to uncover a comprehensive network of terrorist recruits looking for the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had submitted comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page of YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to access the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the recruits in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made it a matter of the highest urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as doormen who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years about who they allow access, because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets and called for a more bold action in the area of climate protection by the negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were more like 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit up small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when there was little happening in the UN-supported climate negotiations, thousands of activists were walking through the city with transparency, on which "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish said "The Earth says" enough. "
Some stars followed the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travel to Peru, the mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heart-breaking problems that the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to pass the word on and appeal to the world leaders to create a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called, as he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes ignited several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, in which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as light rockets, but then were followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the conference centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's head climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the place is great, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it would depend on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they are disrupting the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race club
The certificates of mathematics performance were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C. last week.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest benefits, the evidence shows that the four and eight-year-olds have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average score of the white four-year-olds from Washington D. C. has increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American counterparts have only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-clässler was basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And even though the score that the children of both groups have reached has grown over this period, the difference has now barely decreased by 58 points.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed their concern last week that the results of the school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been driven forward, for the most part, by white students who are already high-performance children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall evaluation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of directors of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that supports equality of education in Washington D. C..
I do not jump up and down for a range of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a more frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the city's central schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson read system, which aims at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic skills of reading did not master at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to the sixth class games and life-like experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NAEP progress reported last week is attributed to this curriculum.
I believe that we must continue to work to give the best measures to the students below the level of the notes, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political consequences that are working against this important item of the agenda.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that it tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we set up a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year for 185 days a year, which he considered to be a "one milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blink a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick simple seed and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-year-olds in the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the year's teaching costs $38.690, was more of a fearful visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told the low-level professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other, there are also hundreds of thousands of people who receive the college training needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano-American students closes the college - which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and a drive to success that is inherent to them.
Many of them also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advice programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
When you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing these children with a support network from pre-school to high school.
The Federal Programme, which Gracielas College-Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gear up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programmes that start when low-income students are in the middle school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluded with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the cut.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin-sown representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European are on the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were underlined by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably stopped American oil companies from, said analysts said that they are more committed to Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, in particular the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For the pre-selected companies, bids were made, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner was to be killed this week, reported by representatives of the US fight against terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second fatal attack on a high-level terrorist organisation in the autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani government representatives in the region, had been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Wazristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a government representative of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Residents suspected of being militants ran to the point and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US fight against terrorism showed indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate nature of the American air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one assumed its central role as a given one, this also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somali had quickly ascended to the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the government, but this does not in any way reduce the risk he presented to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack was carried out by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA's drones has since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organisation, dropped from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decrease may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, brutally kill suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was defied by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure takes place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he was supporting the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is to start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help Afghanistan's political transition.
The force increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not set up his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO.
The Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, will now forward to him the time to provide a replacement.
What I said was that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started to search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-tribal Staffan di Mistura, who has recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election. "
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that are donating for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said I could only hire one person.
This is a disaster and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions on his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for choice, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama government is considering a penalty package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer from the sanctions."
On Friday, in an opinion from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will have to expect "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to reduce its nuclear programme and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is disagreed about whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in terms of some of the proposals to which it had already agreed at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that it never was in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals on 31 December before he will continue to pursue other options, including those that Minister of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "imposing sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated claims" on Thursday by some members of the Security Council on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are prepared to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers to "achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American force by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as a government official in Shanghai, who began to change the course this summer, because of the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was direct and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, reconciled single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors," a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when this policy came into force, the UNO
The number of people aged 60 and over is expected to rise from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1%, well above the global average of about 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old and older people made up almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labour shortages of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "so old - but not as rich - as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial decision that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Marital couples who are in breach of this policy have to expect huge fines - up to their triple annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at work.
Chinese representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical stress on natural national resources could be avoided, and human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural regions, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to drive away.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, which created an unnatural high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their position on one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife have been single children - and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban staff and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Deceptive reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the case of the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 in spite of the campaign -- a little higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted a child, because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, who owns a translation company, said it more unabated.
For parents from the middle class with a double career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is about being successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-old grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the question of space -- "You have to change your apartment," and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a resume for the best pre-schools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group proposes emission reduction plan
The UN-supported climate conference - which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations - has again, on Friday, set a priority for the publication of a document which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to face the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas control, has both identified the remaining obstacles and shown the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a trial that is going to take time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a UN working group specifically created for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policy-makers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called "the great whole."
It shows the basis for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost to its commitment to providing USD 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
The US Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of major emerging countries and taking measures, says Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the statement by the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that it was either a "lack of reason" to the leading American climate negotiator or "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
By the fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies have broken down.
The current fight also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States ordering themselves for their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of the braking of greenhouse gas emissions, as even the countries concerned have taken more aggressive action to take the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic domination will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a draft 24-page contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who runs the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exert political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The discussions were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues need to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Minister for the Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, escaped their planes and raided through the corridors of the Bella Center to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that are being negotiated during the next week.
The mere extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people are entering and leaving the conference center every day, playing guitar activists are doing night shows, in which they are making fun of the countries that they think are selling and selling, and draft contracts are handed over by hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km / h fast train redefines the assembly feeling
Monday morning at 5: 13 am, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train trip that is a revolution in traffic in the United Kingdom.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h on its flash trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and will take 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then be on board the first Javelin-Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually link to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and will connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the change of aircraft and car to the rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three big parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still be a brake on British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will give it a detailed track map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which London is to connect to the West Midlands, will pass by with a space of five meters to urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open area the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped line line, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the line, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to take the London-Birmingham line in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The draft offers the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km / h, which would make the British rail network the fastest Europe.
The first line was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a final station would be needed in London, at which 20,000 passengers per hour could be completed.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Bahnexperten say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing railway lines in the north of Birmingham, so that the travel time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is considered to be a key point in order to ensure a change from the plane to the railway, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Tax payers pay for a mortgage for a conservative's 75,000 pounds of orange
Alan Duncan, the leading resident of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had to build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that house members must live "from lean rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak factory to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The people responsible for the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenditure of the members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "more clean or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest house members, has a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control centre of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has grown a winter garden, which in the plans is called "Orangerie."
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was not invited to comment on the increase in money during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee, after examining its expenditure, released him from the breach of the rules last month.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a member of the Parliament.
This week's published documents show that by March last year, Duncan was reimbursed about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the money acquisition of £75,000 (EUR 85,000).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
In September, Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the lower house, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that MEPs would live "from lean rations."
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live from lean rations and how S * * * * * e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a very small part of it, measured by what is to be.
And I could have called the whole damn sum, but I don't. "
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenses, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the Fees Office that this could "be considered an excessive demand."
An activist as a protest in Duncan's lawn dug a hole in the form of a pawn sign after it was known that he had claimed over three years 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and then by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and leaning or a bending of the rules or something like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be more clean and clearer at all. "
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach cottage Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17: 30 to 18: 30 with free light wine and traditional Mance Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The so far selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the house decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary spiritual of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people to come to a strange old building as a church? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach cottage Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen in order to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish President of the Climate Change Conference, the increasing mobilization of the world for the climate is an example of what these demonstrations show that the "political price" of a failure would be very high in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, all dressed in black, had smashed the window with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police have intervened immediately and with no respect.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, in your opinion mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs," were arrested in the East of France, in April, by these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has strongly criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers had been arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday night," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seat position.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with bosses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asian, including some Chinese and Korean, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth, "to form blue tides" for the "climate justice."
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and tell ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water run where you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
Mr José Bové, a European member of the European Parliament, said that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable as a result of the warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundreds of people, mostly students who marched in red and have heated bandanas in which you have famous the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators took the lead to demand a strong approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the 350 network have gathered a number of hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its President, Georgia denounces that this is a "prank."
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its President, a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "prank."
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetic area, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The polling rooms closed at 5: 00 GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the election, according to the Abkhazian Commission responsible.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
In turn, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be a part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the conflict between 1992 and 1993, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to the election to a polling room that was located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
The large signs on which Bagapch can be seen at the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular as regards the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Ten thousand people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to take action, have arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives the delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From the Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash discs, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police have immediately encircled you and have intervened with no respect by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs," these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents in which approximately twenty people were arrested for the time being. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of order were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
But there were also many Asian, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we are going to the street to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say: we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that defeat, there are rivers through which you can walk, which was never the case in the past."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was set up in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the opponents of globalisation has come closer to environmental protection organisations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila, some hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "350" network, several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille to the south, Lille to the north, Bordeaux to the west and Lyon to the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview, the national education minister Luc Chatel, who appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dikänn," stated that the subjects of geography and history are stronger from the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) have now every four hours of the week and the same programme," confirmed Mr Chatel.
For the Minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued. He said: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who had been upset by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité showed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project to remove compulsory education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question as to the limitation of the philosophy of the programme of the Terminals S. A.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which they believe will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they are subject to a technical aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year to an approval examination, in which their teaching skills are examined.
They also carry out internships in the M2 during the year and then teach one year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours that you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he would like to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education of the people."
He again confirmed that he would like to abolish the school card "until 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to meet on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience for 15 minutes each with their films.
One would like to do something with which people can be reached and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event dates back to the name that the students have given to fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts were selected by the twenty participants, even according to their charisma," he specified.
"You can speak for hours of climate warming. However, the core objectives can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of films in front of about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners may find out that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos made by these conferences will be available online on the school side as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the law enforcement trade unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, the payment of which was postponed for budget reasons until January, were transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of law enforcement officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the staff who are not on duty to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning in front of the law enforcement institution to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The third union of law enforcement officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of the overtime, night allowances and the Sunday and holiday allowances in December became a "shameful and unacceptable" market.
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Court Union (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilizations to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penal Office and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them were included in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims were paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the law enforcement unions to guarantee that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our criminal enforcement system working and to modernise it," the Minister for Justice in this letter.
"I have instructed the administration of the Penal Court to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has been caused by a lack of assessment of the overtime that has occurred, is not repeated in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lean, except for the management staff who benefit from high-level service and target premiums, the UFAP / UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces that "all meetings and calls" will be boycotting up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," also the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being set up without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT trade union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, and some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, states.
Obama thinks that he's always sharing Christmas gifts better than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has been talking to the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always sharing better gifts than he is getting.
On a special show broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nailed the president.
"So please," he said to her in a shameless manner and pointed to the first lady's string of pearls: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unwalled atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"It was only much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of group them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms he was transferred to an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control," although RTL confirmed that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found "damage caused by the operation of a tape disc incident," which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, said his production company in Paris, which added that these damage had required another operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
Only after 48 hours, however, one had a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" it is clear that after its first operation in Paris "no wires were laid."
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a tape disc incident.
The surgery, which was planned for several days, was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on Monday, due to a subsequent infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley." However, he assured that you "don't have to worry" about making the rock musician, because he was "a good fighter."
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, so that's not possible," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responded well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was restrained."
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
However, the concern for the health of the singer had become ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had fallen on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer surgery," which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been very much commented on. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was only in the middle of November that the people surrounding him had to demend a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009 / Short-haul: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, took an international title on Thursday about its favorite distance, 50m free-style, at the Euro-2009 on the short-haul in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record at the 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in the swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman in 20.53 Sek, claimed. In a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight are) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not succeed in breaking the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things, and in this case I have said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their era in Istanbul, which began in 1999 for the first time in the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not pay off for the German Paul Biedermann, two times the world champion in the pelvis this summer in Rome and the world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m of free style (3: 32.77), yet he has achieved his second best time in his career (3: 34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give it all this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job. "
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA: Grabplate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman gravestone, which appeared to the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at $1.5 million above its value, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the III. Century after Christ and was always rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionyso are presented in a sophitic architectural decoration, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Enrichment of Roman and Egyptian Antiques at Sotheby, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly the most for which the buyers have offered so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she showed up piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart," Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola."
Zelaya's escape from Honduras towards Mexico has been distraught
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of President Manuel Zelaya, who had fallen to the ground, to be no longer compatible, after the coup government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone call with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that there is a disagreement in the possibilities of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the Immigration Authority, the aircraft, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of origin.
The Putsch government wanted to ask M. Zelaya to "take off" and to seek political asylum abroad.
However, the President-in-Office of the Council refused to do so because he wanted to return to Mexico as the most welcome and active head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a new failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to thank you," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been in the Central American country for five months.
I am able to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, the President who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted to us a request for guidance, which we cannot accept, unfortunately, because it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch Government, had declared to the Honduran radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would he only act as President of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of a departure by M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the President who had become the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had increased its commitment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the coup government.
This, he said, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organised to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had come back surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The President of the coup, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upturn, the US trade balance is feeding optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the figures of the US trade balance show a price recovery of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67% and the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the end of the market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, in turn, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from different sectors, told Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market is only focused on "half-full glasses," it did not.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are mainly fixed to the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
In October, the US trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in September.
In contrast, the analysts expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the case of goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States's main trading partners, Christopher Cornell commented on the business research of Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States in the last week have increased against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers had "fallen to the bottom of the year in the last four weeks," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday night, and the return on bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power are calling out "ladies in white"
On Thursday, a number of hundreds of partisans in the Cuban power raided out the wives of political prisoners who were gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also denied another rally, for which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
To the forty "ladies in Weiss," wives, or close political prisoners, were raided on the open street of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the main city to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!," "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!," "There live Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partisans with a high fist waged against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of the evening in Havana, in which there was no injured or arrested.
On the other hand, in the Havana area of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also took part in the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police, a reporter of the AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents of the government to enter civil vehicles under the use of force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize issued by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners," the number of which, according to the dissident list, has about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband, Hector Maceda, is in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of which until 53 are behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime's opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries."
The Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the violation of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Crazy guy kills eight-year-old with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A lunatic armed with two knives killed an eight-year-old on Friday against late afternoon for the main business time in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from a previously unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police data, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a police syndicate in the hospital, is responsible for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triggers, intervened and was hurt.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other victim is in danger of life, as, according to police sources, he was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she was hospitalized in the "shock state."
The armed man, who, according to the police, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is to have immediately moved to the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passers, apparently by chance: a three-year-old and a four-year-old, while the latter of both are difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meatballs, which he was carrying behind his back in a cross, said Arnaud Pressé, a member of the Syndicate Alliance of the Haute-de-Seine area.
Several passers, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witness reports established by the AFP, to banish the madman.
I saw a guy in the triggers with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at house number 61, two city police officers, including their chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife marks, such as police information.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me there's a injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first-aid position and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about three years old, was injured by cuts.
The state police forces finally arrested the man who did not carry any ID papers.
The prosecution of Nanterre has commissioned the district unit of the criminal police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out the fact that it is being transferred to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to get him to the police commissioner in Clichy, where he was deported.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the spiritual confusion of this kind, in which the forces set free during the coming of the day."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be stopped
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, for the time being on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), has called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the director of the "pianist," denounced a gross procedural error in the time of the negotiations in 1977 in front of three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California.
I am calling for punishment, said M. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Rittenband, "let it run down to a cold back."
According to him, the - now deceased - judge knights band, before he fell his right to judge, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a nursery -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and decorated" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and sought), especially by the infrastructural prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court of Justice refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel is asking for a process to be conducted which would allow him to submit the evidence of his arguments.
The charge, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the facts put to the defendant's attention cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the death penalty was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not travelled to the United States since that time.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski must be "there to attend the trial."
In this matter, would you like to spread the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are a way out of the question?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested that the prosecution of Roman Polanski be stopped.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded me that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by every relife of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is blocked by the rise of the dollar and closes without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off without a course on Friday in a market that was torn between better indicators than the US's planned and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at the time of closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is quite quiet," Mace noted the view silver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains limited, the volume of trade has become very small, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "helped to improve the market view to the solidity of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which means that two months in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level of the euro for two months, "pushing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something to the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The rate of return on the 10-year-old loan increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482%, and that of the 30-year-old bond to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of a round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and to be in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned as Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true structure of pleasure.
Nice cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was just extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5: 00 (3: 00 in Central European Time) from Midland, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of gala, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, and to enlist Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defy in traditional strides and not to forget in the swimsuit.
The show is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a little more than a little of a warm and proud one, Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari that visited famous township in Soweto, but this time cost by bike and local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave their hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains the draw in Cape Town (southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote for this event a little more.
I'm wrong about people I could probably never get close to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1: 00 local time (21: 00).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "as soon as possible" to the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape disc incident in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press department announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday, due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely affected the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told he did the pure massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
I've heard about the possibility of a court trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled to Los Angeles" far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon.
I made a personal phone call to this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced to RTL that the singer would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operating in Vilnius a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has already been convicted several times for failing to do operations and not to forget for tax evasion and fraud.
My Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Chamber, has referred to him as "a man without a scruple," who has to answer "regularly" to the board of the Chamber and "anything but recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal."
The operation "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require a drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been going on since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The party alliance, which is being monitored by François Bayrou's party MoDem, has on Friday a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and, under threat of a judicial persecution, asked him to use this seal on no more documents.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he considered that François Bayrou was not worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to emphasise his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who was the first to claim the ownership of the UDF brand since he applied for this brand in 2004 to the "Institut national de la propriété industrie."
However, the business office of the UDF party alliance, under the supervision of François Bayrous's friends, was silent and clearly understood that they could not be expropriated and set a time limit for the Minister and the Member, under threat of a judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer the brand's property rights to it.
In the last few days you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal + +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoThem and the Senator Jean Arheim of the Central Alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau center +, the slogan + today's UDF + printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF's office explained and called on the party NC to "remove immediately the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website."
In addition, it was asked by Hervé de Charette to "transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal rights."
If you refuse to do so, we will appeal against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the signatories.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and remind them that Morin and his friends have "made the choice" to leave these 2007 in order to create a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP."
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no right, according to the signatory, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocracy française).
They continue to point out that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 approved the three-year accession to the Modem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name."
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the deposit of the UDF in order to do so for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, in politics and in life, more dignified to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by using a name that you have no legal rights to."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is sentenced for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighties in order to make part of her assets worse.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his starphotos, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in the court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime which will be punished with a maximum of three years of imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair that is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter sit and at the same time have the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions provided during the investigation by the Prosecutor of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly announce whether and at which times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to be subject to these tests.
I will speak to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court of First Instance.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal action against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of taking advantage of the weakness of her mother for years to make gifts of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For your part, Liliane had always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer she considered to be a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidyers of the lawyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was mistrust of the husband of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for 15 years, one to two times a day.
Francoise has never been able to speak since she was married. "
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardian in the last few days has rejected its application to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in its place, "confirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the process of admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the end of the early strategic education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determines the best as it was to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the area... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
The demobilisation of the employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & D, which is even more important, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (Intelligence Economic = Economic Intelligence) "calls for a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach" from all the parties involved; it demands a commitment from the employees to which the instructions of authoritarian management are completely opposed.
We therefore call for an operational revolution, which would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns in an equal way with the customers.
The very benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, how the questionnaire that Orange submitted to his wage-earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that the whole structure, in the face of a new situation, after a lot of detours, is in the process of doing what it has always done.
Even because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - is increasing in proportion to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most managers have a very simplified idea of human behaviour.
It is the first time that the European Community has been able to make a contribution to the development of the European Union.
They take on the old behaviorist theory by intellectual comfort, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) for the involvement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in an attitude to a mechanistic control system that is not suitable for the present world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of management: for the wage-earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears to be a clear means of implementing part of its dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they are assessing their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their objectives.
The identification and measurement of these mobilization factors allow the managers of the companies to control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and to place their human resource management back in the right place.
They create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed the speech made by Barack Obama on the eve in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had mocked the award to Obama on 9 October applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today daily, and added that she even raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo, a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognised the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech has felt quite historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous Member, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not give a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does," he "spoke like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, referred to the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, high-tenacity and ininspirational."
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If you put the war under the cover of the justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama early, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Carriers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the TLF and the road union trade unions - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday night that would put an end to the strike warrant and the threat of a serious supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement would be signed quickly in the late morning.
And that, though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours were left from the beginning of the meeting at 11: 00 until the agreement was concluded and the agreement was not signed until 6: 00.
The conflict "would have done a lot of harm to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not very much, but we start with small ones," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some dissenting people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of the 13th month content and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the employers' charges of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 bill of adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies connected to that organisation and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time," says Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR has denounced "fraudulent trade," as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to compensate for some of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to destroy the goose food on the next Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "threatens to bring a big grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals
The problems on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport management) left the strikers waiting with their demands for wage supplements.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas no trains were made between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside of the central line was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to move.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the major business to transport technology."
The line RER A passes through the Paris metropolitan area from the west to the east.
The RATP section connects the places of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains at the main traffic time was scheduled, and almost none during the poor traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human cloak on the platforms, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had adapted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overrun than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29) said that he would have "got up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to the passengers by staff and administrative staff, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare train station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove over the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results of the meetings which the associations had considered to be "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
This is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-overdue wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its own wage-fixing proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leaders who, up to now, rejected any discussion during the strike, and approached a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a prior announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of passengers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, have a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services and Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party, a decision following immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is a major threat to the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "site for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which Turkey and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders of the party expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the State Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it is "not connected" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is in the hands of the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-outbreak of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the arrest conditions of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had in recent weeks led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the million-city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The forces used tear gas grenades and water launchers when the demonstrators began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turk assumed that the decision of the Court of First Instance "will further deepen the despair."
"Turkey cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, English, German) on the basis of a party's ban," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Tanner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It is obvious that a PKK reaction can be addressed," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK declared itself to be an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snowfall may come
A really crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, the winter service manager of the FES says.
But so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to the meteorologists, it could be there for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are taken off by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main and transit roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting routes, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with fences, like the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3 o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 km would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt that is more resistant.
That is why the FES starts at 3: 00 in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It will be difficult when it snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is prepared to make room for the stray vehicles."
It is only after that, if it does not continue to snow, that it is the turn of the supply and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, white Brauburger.
At 5 o'clock in the morning the FES foot-people are on their way, danger points and transitions are addressed as a matter of priority.
The FES could not usually take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which will keep an eye on the bridges from 22: 00 to 4.30: 00, says Brauburger.
As there are on this fast glass, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the sprinkler is on the way.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1,50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangäa on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species
In the course of the excavation they carried together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Found confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, mostly only single pieces of fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs showed up for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts are discussing when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, known as the "long-term" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants of the eating Ornithischia (bird-basin saurus), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, the researchers found, for example, evidence of air bags, as they also have the descendants of the Theopods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also sometimes filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and light-building bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first showed up there.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all the parts of the earth, which were still a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of sisters of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America, just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is little to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile tribe to the dominant farmers of the Earth's age, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the air saurs and with many other lizards.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border from the Trias to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that happened to survive the dinosaurs, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteor impact of a group of animals on the flowers, which had also developed in the trias and since then had been a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, is a university in California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is a global wave.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers on the education strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been painted.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the Signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The exposition is a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delilisation and criminalisation of the protest" and distracts the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers are calling for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupaners did not support the material damage, they say.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landesjugenssecretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the President of the Union and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU country representative Peter Beuth.
In other words, the opposition groups saw this as the SPD, the Green and the Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it was clear.
The left has tabled an amendment calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For a long time it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow center, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley."
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds have been in contact with the Frankfurt scientific site of Riedberg - with the uniinstitutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning dezerent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a question of a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIS companies are able to take a stand on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for the research of arms.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart Brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe."
Right so. S21 is much more than the laying down of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade into a heinous construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, the main railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered to be the transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which were like the brake blocks of a modern rail traffic, since it once took a great deal of time to move locomotives from the back to the front.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
And that's why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about half a distance from the trans-European rail magistrate between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe."
S21 is now in fact being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost priceless to implement the laying down.
However, the main stations no longer have a problem with entry and exit since modern turn trains with engines and control cars are available at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 plus the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being approached.
National and local politicians have made it happen.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure-individual project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state-owned groups are borne.
The project can still be justified by urban development.
New city space is created, which - in the opinion of the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which was attributed to huge growth - typical of the 1980s.
At the time, there was not the competition of the low-cost aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by road.
But the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy increases.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also has many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be bundled in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the well 180 km long line through the Rheintal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the road in the time-lupentempo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will look like a brake lock.
The Rhine valley line becomes a bottle neck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government is examining judgment to the airport
The State Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU / FDP coalition has appointed experts to have the more than 400-page VGH judgment examined legally, said Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway in Frankfurt airport, the country had to reregulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the national government, was not compatible with the legal protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to a ban on night flights to their pre-election promises. Otherwise, this would be considered a "word break."
It is very hard to keep your word, said Green-Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, in a reference to the FDP slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get to its night flights with "right-wing and trickery."
A precise legal examination will take time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression."
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they were the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken US large banks are disbanding their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (just 30 billion euros) at a single rate.
And the Citigroup also plans to return the state aid after a report by the US station CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of managers' bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had provided a good 19 billion dollars of fresh money to investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
On Wednesday night, bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: the money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had moved to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported on the call of circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Fast choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote on the staff.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the station - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it is also likely that a role would have been played not to further damage the ZDF-Intendant Markus Schechter, should this proposal not be made to the Board of Directors either.
Frey, a bad candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The result of the vote was not yet clear at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years, Schechter failed the board of directors.
Only seven members were in favour of Brender, seven were against him. Brender's election was a hard defeat for the bad guys, but one expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The resistance was organized against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost control, he rejected a further term of office of the highly respected chief editor.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was distraught.
In the last few years, even 35 state-courts had intervened in the debate, which considered the Koch approach to be unconstitutional.
It didn't do any good.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
= = = ZDF = = = In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, and in the first place to the "today-journal."
Following stations: 1988 to 1990, personal editor of the chief editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998, head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens, after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the industry magazine medium magazine as a journalist of the year on Wednesday, announced a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals from the intendent cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also ruled out Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors with a smart move - by strongly criticizing the body for this immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this staff of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both the warden without loss of face for the post of chief editor and the board of directors, without being suspected of being a party-leader.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is assigned to the left-liberal anyway.
Study is unravelled
After one year of the education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally launched on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and the Rector of Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the audit burden: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
The aim is also to review the workload of students and to ensure "a realistic and reasonable level."
In addition, policies and universities want to facilitate the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cultural ministers and university rectors have been using the winged word of the better student in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part: "Each module usually concludes with only one test," it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially reregulate the approval of courses.
The "significant reduction in the audit burden," the Accreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm said, was to "stop the development of a misdevelopment that significantly affected the student's ability."
In addition, "student" will in future be the key criterion "in the design.
In the case of modules such as content, "to check strictly" whether "unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of the
This is the first time that the European Parliament has been able to take a decision on the matter.
The students would have "the right to have room for manoeuvre that would allow and promote their own initiative."
The rules are to apply in the case of the approval of new, but also in the case of the review of existing programmes.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years - which means that it will take until 2015 to review all the programmes.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are responsible for the adoption of the Accreditation Council established by the countries throughout the country.
In October, the Ministers of Culture "urged" the countries "to influence the agencies in such a way that the substance is not too large and the examination system is not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the State Ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional resources to the further development of the Bologna process.
The main aim of the money is to set up tutors and to strengthen study advice and audit and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to bring a revision of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to this, only one study is to be required for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies is to be made more flexible, and the recognition of evidence of performance at other universities is to be ensured and access to the master is to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all the programmes of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso higher education groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students should now also "get a word out of it."
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rector's Conference (HRC), Margret Wintermando: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday, with which the HRC discussed a common reform paper.
The Association of Education and Science (GEC) did not go far enough in all: it calls for a legal claim to allow any graduate with a Bachelor's degree to access a further Master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelor students, there will be sufficient Master's degree courses with the best possible conditions of study tomorrow, said Gew board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to hire much more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves in favour of a more free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
The first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this one in disturbing language flaws addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won the freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing company before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literary Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a significant out-of-literature appearance last Tuesday at a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of their security acts."
Söllner, who was a member of the Romanian Parliament for the first time in his life, was a member of the European Parliament and of the European Parliament, and was a member of the European Parliament.
Together with some of the people present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have started in a slippery way, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not fought enough against the intimidation of the Securitus."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that indicates the abyss and the defiance of a political system based on monitoring and focus.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say in the past, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner by the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut it out" in all the deefficient points for him at that time, said Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The people concerned, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases have probably also known what clear name was hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the more procedural view of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been driven back and forth.
A National Council for the Development of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 is there a law governing the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview was held in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar was abruptly informed about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
I am sure that the case of Söllner, as so often in the context of hidden debt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been damaged? The sensual response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for knowledge rather than by debt allocation and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Satisfaction supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was an adrettt-dressed outside service from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sports product manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose to a C-class a quarter hour after midnight.
The man with the striking glitter was driven because of the still strange city.
Otherwise he could have been driving himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was not the same.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow's work will go on.
Or get going.
In the words of the first three days before the Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary in Mainz to repeat the Royal Class performance in the Liga daily life.
And after the fast three gates, the very once again revealed weaknesses by Marica (5.), Tresch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exhaust
The eighth final of the Champions League (in the second half of February, February 16, February 23, 24, February 9, March 16, and March 17) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant rebellion of the Babbel successor remained true.
Not only in the supposed Heilsbringer, who had taught the unsafe Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, willingness to use and joy to play.
I went to the players and told them to remember their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more brave, so the shrink big explained the so simple-sounding success recipe, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injustices, came to the best player in the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the operation of the new superior: "He is a man who is perplexing and demanding discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel, it was obviously a big deal.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all constancy.
Like big, players and managers were also afraid to overassess the victory against a replaceable and completely overhauled defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening at 0: 4 gave Khedira to remember.
And Horst Heldt, the sports board, warned that while a season target was reached, the other one was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not in a position to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview by Torhäter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the board a lack of leadership and decided to change the training on the pressure of puberting fans.
Also that his free day had been cancelled after the games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt returned and announced consequences for the closing man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life, the two four-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work of the team, the playful and fighting-strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in the heavy weight
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Over and over again the challenging Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainians defended their weight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judge's judgment was unanimously rejected.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the world's box champion in weight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the WBC Association, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on the night of Saturday in Bern after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.o. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights; twice he had to be beaten due to injuries.
challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left-hand lead.
The 11-inch-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, has, however, repeatedly withdrawn the World Master's battles, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive conclusion.
In total, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and was just trying to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his battles only rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of 12 rounds.
Before the fight in the Swiss capital, the challenger had provided some vertebrae.
He insulted Klitschko as "ugly zombie," who "can't do anything right."
On Friday, the champion could then be provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of work, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "recovered his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year he forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one hit in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the rapid return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after it was able to dethrone the Nikolai Walujev, which was 2.13 meters tall in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
His promotion company is now already planning to fight Klitschko in the London Wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Front attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has referred to defence minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left are calling for the Chancellor to be informed.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the recent findings of the air attack by Kunduz, the opposition's defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been subject to a conscious deception.
The Minister had said "knowingly the truth" to the deadly bombardment on two tanker trains from September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Day Show."
It's called the land-going, he's been lying.
The order to kill had been issued in breach of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) called on Green, SPD and Left to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the new strategy was approved by the Chancellor, the Federal Defense and the Intelligence Service, asked Jürgen Trittin and Green Mrs Renate Künast.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on the concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the background to the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneider and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have been properly and completely informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially it was said that they denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, the two top officials' environment indicated that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the missing Colonel Klein and a field hunter's report.
In the meantime, Wichert has asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper."
He has not yet received an answer, he says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which would like to establish itself next Wednesday.
dream worlds
Some see images in a warm state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are not only blurred in the case of mental and drug abuse.
As long as it happens in your sleep, it's all right.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves to the wildest ideas and imagination.
However, those who experience dreamy states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug-addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of mentally ill people or in the case of drug abuse.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, to paint pictures or to write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, truth and reality disappear.
Dreamingly changed consciousness can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
The visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of relaxation, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes, even if the effects and effects may differ.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural bone substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of truth and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the watchful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, established in 1861 a "great resemblance of error with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of such a kind."
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book.
His body is two-dimensional and squeamish.
Gravity has no power over him anymore, he's floating on the room deck.
He can feel a kick.
Behind him winged devil shapes with blood red, distorted fragments, tearing.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Loud, evil voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that slander him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, fastens them to a blade and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a speaker and puts the blade around his neck.
Jump.
The blade dissolves.
This is a lesson to you, the voices in a drum-tearing choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is 2 years ago, the first one is almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressed, he's taking drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deep despair, he says.
The tribulations are cruel reality
About one percent of the population is suffering from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most people can no longer distinguish between the internal and the outside world, they get into an overdeveloped state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialect.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate important things from unimportant ones, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the event, everything has a meaning that is aimed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenic people often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually not able to compare reality, the tribulations are cruel reality, and wake up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, is in principle preserved."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
In any human being, exceptional situations can lead to a short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic approach to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the factors that determine alone.
Researchers believe that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains fox.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neuronal system comes about, which, in addition, does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the cause of psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get to which, says Lübeck's professor of psychology, Erich Kasten.
Whether it is felt to be pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports for ten years about hallucinations and deafness, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irrational World in our Head."
Hallucinations are one of the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Hallucinations, according to box, are made up of memory content, which are usually held back.
They occur when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love pain or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that they had experienced a hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the high school.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
In the break it may happen that a sleepy boy with long, dark hair will touch it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
If I'm crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other trick pictures are not real and are gone again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening
The trugimages are often also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new student, while he explains mathematical equations for everyone else on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees are the fragments or the girl with the bleeding cuts on the arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them about it, they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the graduation last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she got in touch with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
True is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is suffering from travel, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is under-busy then, and I think it'll make its own conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think is not her physical father.
As the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish trugbilds and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they look so real. "
Even night-time dream pictures of castes are regarded as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mental healthy people are able to recognize their trugimages as irreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Condition between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too much-focused world, imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also contains positive, creative - True is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has been researching the so-called uneiroid form of experience, a special form of the dream-changing consciousness of the guard.
Oneiroid are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced considers real and which he cannot distinguish in retrospect from the state of watch.
The uneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a human being is threatened by self-loss and world loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, it replaces the life-threatening real situation with its own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of state of the art between dream and hallucination.
As the management of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning foundation and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which allows us people to have their own ability not to go down in a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzweben" as a life-saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplant goes on travel for days, while his body in the intensive station is sentenced to inmobility.
Claussen is immersed in a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: he is seen as a bed-bearing old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who make narcotics from blood.
It is taken by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, surfing with its hospital bed in the Firnschnee of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for classen.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are still clear to me after years and in other details.
More clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is blowing the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of the external reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist's box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children are to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding should continue to belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have prepared the details for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises after that.
The question also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
This will kill the children and the company too.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January, and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen would be appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors of Burda since 1999.
At first he was in charge of technology.
Later on, the Treasury was responsible for the company's assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, the direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," said Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the fall: "This always concerned families that were infected by a capital search that was completely speculated and thought that they could become a very big player.
My strategy never was.
He had "never had world power dreams," said Burda.
I do not see myself as the political precedent of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Full beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao, Madrid, where it is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, one can find among others prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which ensure a hair removal with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department, which, through its tea house, has more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours rent the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" on the feet with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for the hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit with the entry of a personal password on a touch screen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
If, after you have trained your body, you would like to visit the hairdresser's salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room in which treatments for the recovery of the hair beauty, the shine and the health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and get their festive clothes in our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an oversized and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office."
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility through the management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied by the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace."
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminded again of the measures that the government has launched in support of the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production works," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the potential of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of the government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's efforts to boost demand, in response to the 2000 E plan, which was applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of the government, this plan allows the exhaust gases of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced on average by 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the authorisations that increased "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental-friendly sportsmanship
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is the result of its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can see that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
In the further examination of the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is in the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the supervisory colors red and blue.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are abstaining from the sobriety of the German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive the car in a very comfortable way.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is so far only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-gear switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is characterized by its fineness, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the gear connection and its low consumption, even though in Mazda the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series equipment is the main source of the RVM, which thus removes the dead angle, but also the control elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-Bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, the learning bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not spend many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is a little high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the luxury model and 23,270 euros for the Sportive model that has been tested.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving fun.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, were more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of glory when it chose the magazine Time as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is more unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, quite unlike the pitch where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to do without all the data to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or when you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but in my experience, you already need a PhD in physics and a good glasses to read all the small print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe was almost always ignored.
Outside of your own country, you're always afraid to read your emails, and that's right.
That a small device like FonPeek (which is always amazing, that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a wifi / WLAN) can offer this type of tariff means that telephone providers have to rethink slowly, but safely, and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
No ligature and no hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, that is, when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a life-long Internet purchase option like the peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetishcolor of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
She appeared in a dress and a coat of this color when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States and has again chosen the same color to accompany him in his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama was wearing very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and she was wearing a little big-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to appear at the first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a painted velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time a nice model, but gold colours.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was put up on this occasion as a hair wreath, the previous hair was open.
75% of working mothers have had problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in the labour market has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey under 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt that 75% of women in work see their career opportunities in the labour market reduced due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women are working and, if so, what kind of profession they are doing.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract will become more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, shift the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment are given their first child on average only 3.7 years after the reunification, a number which is increased to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have completed their assembly and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of willingness to receive, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary or higher education, became mothers on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with the main closure are already getting married before their first permanent position and having their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are doing it in a different way and are first looking for a permanent position and then getting married and then having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his list of embassies, which was enraged by all of us: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising word "Because you are worth it."
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish woman Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional embassies: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (acting colleague of Evangeline in" Lost').
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents the three X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life) in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but is looking for a sensibility to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save from horror or enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the incurable fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "This woman, with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, has put our man into her spell, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to come into the sky on the way to destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 800s peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try to get back on. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cow.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size. "
Over Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the crazy cry that was written out of a bridge from that person from Munich, so that his echo could shine deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did so on a journey where he fled himself and begged the afterworld with a speech of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneel down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: 'sleep after effort, / after the thunderstorm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a decent life you will find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the Azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than try to put Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium? "
Faithful aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age were walking next to her and our dog, our dog is a blender that we took from the shelter, which weighs only six kilos, and then from the hot sky they missed him two steps and hit him hard.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun is to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the leash.
There is also the suffocation that a woman who went for a walk in a comfortable way, when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older man or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at 5: 00 in the afternoon on a very common Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have reported in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
The aim of this initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the use of the helmet, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that become more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that, with other actions, they also contribute to the achievement of this objective by educational and informative means.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that traffic safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, it is always a commitment that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever more secure products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent a 12.6% increase in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, in line with the figures presented by the producer association Anfac and the manufacturer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008 are a particularly bad year of sale with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% lower than the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles from which the small transport market consists: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter small trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, the same weather clouds in the sky are still the most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the large part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of the financial crisis of credit institutions, need to include other factors, such as the increase in unemployment or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support has helped little to buy a vehicle in the 2000E plan.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a small transport of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Gervam had reminded us that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealer association prophesied a similar year for the year 2010 to the previous one, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and land cars) of 19%.
The support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control system, the emergency braking systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already a duty for all newly registered passenger cars and light small vehicles, for the rest of the vehicles a period of time was set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not get to the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not been fully inhibited.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake support, on the other hand, is used with the maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance that a car is doing during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving the damage of pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that any fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall exercise the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel to January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the site concerned already gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM will ensure that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, who has a back cover from the Russian group Converg, is becoming more and more popular.
If none of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, which makes it only 1 275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to renounce the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent-wall roof with manual drive, so that one alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air-conditioning again 13; in addition, one reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so another 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporty bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims.
Then one had another six kilos less by renouncing the audio system CDR-30 and by replacing the door handles by handles made of fabric the missing kilo reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK double-coupling gearbox, the test drive was carried out with a 6-line hand gearbox, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very short.
In his driving behaviour, one can only give him the note unbeatable.
However, the reduction in its weight has not in any way led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, but at the same time there is a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the time we need to give him the orders to race, to slow down, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
He's doing everything he's told, and the car is doing everything we can with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether out of the stand or when reaccelerating.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads, on which we were driving with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car was good for the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire line; and that, although we found ice in the morning and in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving fun, as it is usually rare, and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl
The singer, a business friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same necklaces as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she is a "Bag Girl."
The Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes first within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight times the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of work and work, even if they had to wait for their victory to the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue red, who sat at the top of the display board from the beginning.
As the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the Álava team chose to play Barac on the inside and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with puffs and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter had already shown that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
However, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided and the macabaeans wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the ever-attacking "hand of Elías" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the fact that the "yellow" turned the rudder (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a few games with meeting security to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the display board again a calming distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavese were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first three minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, were not signed and tried to give their team the power again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was set off for Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended well and even though the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaya from being foretold
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and that was in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blinded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even if the local team, with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schorsanitis, managed to show the scoreboard in their favour in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which the action almost came to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the leaving of the English man Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleiza, with its triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third part of the game was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to make up for the difference of 66-48 in the 27th minute in Málaga, which, in turn, caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the disappearance of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31. minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis again came some hope to 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to take the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now learn their salary, due to their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the user's salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. There is a form available to the users in Facebook that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the United Kingdom and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31.059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11.592 euros per year net; followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 euros and that of a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most wanted places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day posts and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation not later than 27 January 2010if his mandate is officially terminated
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, as his mandate will expire on that day and he must seek a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the set date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician who the de facto government, under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti, wanted to force him to do.
Thank you.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned on the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow the liquidity to be free at interest rates that move around zero so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to scatter some sand into the transmission, as the BCE näc has already suggested with its annual auction taking place next week.
Therefore, investors are in doubt about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are now witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchange and the differences in the company bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to state the private risks and government debt is rising again.
We are now again relying on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the euro-zone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability so far, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down with regard to the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk who had once again tried to create a awareness of what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that the limitation of credit led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided to take a new day to thank them.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also anticipated earlier.
A government that doesn't have the government's debt, elections and a new government that's on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that at the beginning of the year, Ecofin will save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments and therefore allow a euro member country to cease to fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of public funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some exhalation to too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, it is not necessary to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European company bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to continue to increase, this would be a specific Spanish risk.
This is a farce by Standard & Poor's. While the indicators that are at the forefront of the market research institutes force a large proportion of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their upward scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this, despite warnings, does not promise a long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is called "caution when driving."
Connected branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on energy supply in Spain is being discussed over the next two decades.
After his performance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain must invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion from this date by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more are needed, under the conditions of the proposal, of course, by other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal use, which is exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are clearly in favour of this direction, despite some" individual "measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
If it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investment should be taken already, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement on which no figures have yet been published is set at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona is competing with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German court are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city council wants the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration had chosen a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to drive the project forward according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and the toll site management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 billion), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrow choice, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises massive construction and privatisation, but has a hurdle to overcome, as only by buying a local construction company can you get access.
A strategy that has been followed by the above-mentioned companies, in addition to Asian references, and which still needs to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% participation in the high-level company, the owner of the Leighton.
millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets it already has its largest wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been entrusted with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to get access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the Office of Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and is called Northern Link (North Zubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 km by tunnel. This is the largest measure to reduce the traffic on the streets of Brisbane.
The map issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is involved in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high-tech, Brisbane is ready for his big business.
Australia has repeatedly signed a contract with the government of 154 million to Hechtief.
The ACS sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and Hochtief has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke is also competing for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction work for the extension of the Boshuck tunnel (Austria) of more than 130 million.
In this way, Alpine increases its experience in the construction of the tunnel.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros a year, informed the railway company.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented the competition that Renfe issued, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom for the suspension of the competition.
The French Competition Authority imposed a penalty of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition with fixed network and mobile phone through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company have accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 for the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that is in charge of the competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become obsolete.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application business on the Internet to increase the revenue outflows that do not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this sieve to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought to Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for the football club since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League will not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992 / 93 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and who, next to AC Milan, has the only one who won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is based on Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also take the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that were able to make money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini is in charge of the Champions League, expects revenue of 1,090 million.
Of this money, the UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the pre-qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an indecisive (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner deserves 9 million, in contrast to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked, are also included.
This money is granted in proportion to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places allocated.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-party and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday had details of the purchase offer of shares that it would like to acquire between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage which, due to the number of shares, does not force it to make a public tender (Grandpa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jéréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the Authority.
The deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In the attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial quails of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created item, which is directly under the chairperson of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics, because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar's loan, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public exclusion notice of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer

New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, it is not only the motor vehicle workshops that deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles that have been involved in an accident are carried to the workshops, where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
No accident is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest information tools, it is a question of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the evaluators use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audtex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies that compete in the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales manager of Audtex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorization have been on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work for the companies begins.
It is a difficult task, because every single one of the Aberthousand parts of the vehicle must be categorized and its price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, on which you can "click on" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is fast.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audtex has complete information at 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audtex has eight distributed centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audtex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audtex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products that Audtex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it gives to the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the evaluation of accidents for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to the use, i.e. for each opinion.
Most expensive it will be for customers who use it rarely, up to a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions is negotiating the price with Audtex.
With other products, such as Audavin, one can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, only by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional market on the Internet, with which one can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on the differences by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be used in the workshop due to a break or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and in the same way provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the group Einsa, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, fumes and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT-Guide for Opinion is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% a year over the last three years and in 2008 the turnover was 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audtex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and was established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audtex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005 the group Solera was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Inauguration of accident cars on the Internet
In the past October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flat for the sale of car and motorcycles on the Internet.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who have to be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been declared must no longer be on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars with historical value may be re-approved, even if they have been unregistered after difficult government procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audtex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the model will appear and the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, up prices or discounts and then have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for monitoring such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At the moment, the company Audtex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have long been waiting for, for example, for you to select a door with it and then turn the image completely around to view the inside.
