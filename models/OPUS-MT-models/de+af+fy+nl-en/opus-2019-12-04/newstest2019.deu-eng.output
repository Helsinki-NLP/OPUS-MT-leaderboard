DFB-Chef Grindel does not see a basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he obviously felt one or the other in the way that was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrase Mower" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92 times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and was also based on the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with the German trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club, you talk to your coach about it, and I find it a shame that this conversation has not yet come about."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensettlement burned
At 2: 13 p.m. the professional fire department Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angeerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensettlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade returned and found the cabin in full fire at the time of the arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed from the ground and fire debris removed to the essential extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery attached to the store at noon.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother is fighting: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this very strange action?
She obviously wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she seems to want to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is what the US portal "TMZ" reports and publishes a partial cut of the stream.
Here you can see "Lucky Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family just flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accused the adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is in the video to hear her follow the family further along the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around, and Lohan's gonna miss an earfight.
Under tears, the actress controls how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved on to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
She should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that she can soak material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The Lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the heavy earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 victims of death.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas and have been cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
In the beginning there was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk caused a disturbance in the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The US stock market surveillance sued him for fraud, but now both of them have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain chairman of the board.
Conference of British Conservatives
Shotly guarded - the Tories' Day of the Party
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The meeting will be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front of the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these namespoplations for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia should be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands of people went to the streets in several cities to protest against Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the front of the polls.

Audi: "diesel gate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in place," said development board Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobile Week."
In December 2017, the arrested and chartered Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine / gearbox combinations were probably tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel channel at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and would like to continue the discussion on this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities are accusing the Audi Chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the disposal of the waste gas fraud.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
The company is currently head of the company's sales board, Bram Schot.
Due to the change to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is counting on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations available.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm should be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, will again be running for the post of DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it can," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to participate in the future project after the addition of the football EM 2024."
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to cooperate in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to be consulted in this role in the future and then, of course, warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could be his successor as a DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become the integration ambassador of the DFB in the future.
At present this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic practice, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the subject is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Take off correctly with a semi-smart balance
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about me replacing fat with muscles.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear opening sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
The vice-master won against Science City Jena with 112: 55 (52: 31) without any problems and offered a convincing match for over 40 minutes.
New access to Roka's giedraitis was the dominant Berlin with 20 points of top score.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory play debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with the guests with 24 points best boatmen.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 meters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
The new national player Karim Jallow was the top 24-point shooter on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings won 25 meters at the Oldenburgers.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 course of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens the mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were in use - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is critical because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, buoys and horror seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and diseases at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Engage yourself wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of some 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also showed themselves on stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, afraid and tried to escape.
A short time of panic, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was the audience cheering and applause - Buhrife, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons were on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and so many women were faced with it.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges, after two women who, according to his own information, had themselves experienced sexual attacks, faced him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You are also happy to meet me in an elevator at any time," said Flake to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the release of the journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the release of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist, who lived in Hamburg, had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He's the one who caused the man to be taken out by the guards.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate issue.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage, support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades in prison.
Also foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a lot of attention.
They were released and could return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for the moist talks at the counter of the Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Schellfischpost."
Moderator Ina Müller has some beer, some wine or more highly prose-like drinks with her guests to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for compulsory singing.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "men's hearts," "Terror - Your judgment" or "The most horny day."
The Münchner did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two little slits left.
The bed selfie shows a fully equipped Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only got a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - findings that he has now won: "Rule one: does NOT go to Inas's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which throws Ina at half past three, also leaves away.
The consumption of alcohol is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans were about to post a few tips to fight the posterity.
They ranged from instantbroth, fish rolls or - probably the most target - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the usually attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the night-time drinking, it is not known yet.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun on the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unadvice
The entrance to the 36 km long railway road in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and milled.
Recipes against the gratifying vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly visible.
Scratches, cigarette chickens, waste and unravel, demoted waste bins and now dismantled signs - for a long time the entrance with a seating group to the bike path on the Haate hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the example of the railway bike road in the Rotkäppchenland a more than unruly sight.
The subject has been a member of the ADFC group Schwalmstadt but also of others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
There has not been a solution.
The proposals ranged from the transfer of the seat group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject has also been included in the local council.
Not only the waste is driving cyclists and residents around - the sitting group is on weekends regular meeting place to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, the joints are also destroyed: the posts are torn from the earth, the dumpster is destroyed, the signs are cut, the seat furniture is covered.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest site on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for the drinking season.
"Along the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus here on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new wheelstand in Goegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold much higher to intercept with common good.
This would, however, require a police strike to come by soon.
In principle, Wästenhagen wishes to develop the Haate hill.
It had to be made more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still extensive.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical point of danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no sign of a beacon on the Haate hill.
In case of traffic, it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for help" is the appeal of the city-part-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with blinkers in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, a ensemble from the kindergarten of Lummerland and finally Rike Wessling and the Black.
This contest, district mayor Joachim Schmidt said, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the texters see in connection with?
The Hiltruper See and the Market Allee were particularly common in the places.
In his "Kö von Hiltrup," Rolf Ihmich shortened the Allee in his "Kö von Hiltrup" ("Kö von Hiltrup").
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Over and over again it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or references to their work.
This is how he learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he was recently in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, in the meantime, has placed himself on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was still something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: with his help-team, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children appeared to the final again - and even without electronic support sounded "really good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, consistency of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Partieloffensive.
The city-level offensive had created the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
All were "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red film - only after you have put it in.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything by mistake.
The maps then say, for example, from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Fest. "
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that should be guessed here, but codes.
A player per team is the encrypted one.
He gets a code card that says maybe "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" the terms behind the secret film are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe the terms "dice," "festive" and "windows" - in this order and in this example - in such a way that his own team can see the correct order and the opposing team is not able to do so; for this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The Encryption therefore notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to the festival; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible because he was careful in school and knows the window crash there.
That's the way it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite - but it can be better combined with any indication that the encryptor gives there.
The rewrite should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames," which also brings a subject of agency to a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about guessing and not about winning points, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police hillerguss and harassed guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
He first showed the hillerguss in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also fell in the Upper City in a bar when he harassed other guests.
After being clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of non-constitutional organisations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The station in Pressig was the turning point in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, it was heard in all the Prestige," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
There the brakes also squeaked and the wagons clapped.
It was just a train.
Statements that stand for Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep-disaster mountain line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its foothold point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, the train and drawers used to be needed, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway works station with 21 train stations, apprenticeship workshops, driving and railway masters.
"The centre was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway for 47 years.
The station (BW) Pressig, which was under the supervision of Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the sections of Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalm.
On 15 July 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and drawers.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighing was still carried out in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were cut off, in 1991 the rest were cut off.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not consider a better use of the location, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later on.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were taken off, the Rangerbahnhof Pressig was a history.
"The rangers and the hammers did the most difficult work in the train," Dinkel recalls.
Any miscarriage would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the conversion of the Hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success in China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonist Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.

The sister-in-law now has to do with Anett Conteveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelerenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoying" series.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelerenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the "Rum um Walberla" tourism association as part of the series "Art and Enjoying."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great appeal to visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelerenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He's been there for the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he laid his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and have co-designed flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of art & pleasure, there is another 70-cent special stamp, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn aufängen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high level of commitment of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical framework.
During the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "wind play performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfully.
There are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, coloured, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoe and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairyingly sunken and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Wascheck, who in three-dimensional letters is dedicated to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On the half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind-play performance" to slimmer through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the albachters also at that time gave air to their indignation.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they lifted the MGV 68 albachts from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting."
"It's going to be full today," President Jürgen Holsteege suspected, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachtener singers.
For the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary the tradition festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes before.
As usual, the guests were not sitting in the "House of Meeting" in a series of seats, but at tables.
In the meantime, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put the regulators on and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 made the voice sound themselves.
It was a good occasion to have a happy song.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had before it, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein."
"Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin name for "hops," was a reference to another cool drink.
Again the choir line of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who was in the Tinnenbush at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holsteege: "He has such a light way, it's a master performance he does." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves in singing.
The women's choir "Hohe C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreen from the 20s to the 1960s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until 3: 00 in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And also Andreas Winterhoff presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in League Three.

And that at the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against the city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"This was not glass-clear, but we have already left an impression," says the kind of satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed to this: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party by Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a record ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can already tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routinised forces and brought the full benefits to the goal.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like that.
It's not gonna break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not hesitate with the 0: 3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent, after just three days of the game does not seem to be foreseeable.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not almost comparable with regional volleyball. "In the fourth league they do not want to look down.

However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven parties.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have had a share of her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series that made her become a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
For I was grown up with this work, traveling around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at an eye level, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday. "
First of all, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thought it was possible that her husband at the time could have been quite jealous, but "as many men, Hans was also afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to know my fears of my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind, "as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in fact, even though I sometimes appeared to be naughty and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the wedding, I was sitting in the cloakroom crying and trying to cancel everything.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Why did it never work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone far too naïve to love. "
The night-fold, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ-resort Zurich, has dared to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but a little light-shy.
And the bright splendor in which a green carpet has been dipped on the bristles' square, blinds it for a fee.
But it's a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunken in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday night, he torches over the square to make it easier in the "Aquaclean WC oasis."
This is what the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, is called, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
That night, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason.
So, get out of here, get over to the other side of the road: Loaded guests who, in the cinema next door, had the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the festival with a party in the three-storey warehouse, like every year.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are well known from the whole globe.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival so as not to fall into the loop for its 190 partner companies?
The falter ties around the feelers, which has a good fairy attached to him, and two bully doormen actually turn him in generously.
In, the raids are pushing themselves, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be predefined by DJ rhythms, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite paws.
In the delicatessenshop in the basement oysters wait for sloping mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprouted.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If that's two separate instructions, he's in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly saved lives.
In the household department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye," suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here that night either.
But there, between local celebrity, cash table and kitchen articles, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrely, the director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far from there.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is about to walk through the crowd, with almost sixty almost like a chorboy.
He's not being chatted, he's not gifted, he's being stoned at the most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a clairvoyance, international stars love this film festival.

For the break, the gap was only two goals.
In particular, Senden's Bester, Marius Hintze, met the other time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst looked like 15: 15, then the team changer led almost through.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Incoming the impartisans into the process.
Bieletzki is usually afraid to look for the blame for others.
But: The 120-second time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys had a great fight, had a good stand against seven men in the back and threw them back on the empty gate.
But they can't buy much for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was the rest of the world.
ASV gates: Hint (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billionaire-heavy company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervision SEC filed an extrajudicial dispute about misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost the permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and for three years, Musk gives up the office of Chairman, a position similar to the German Supervisory Board.
He can stay the head of the board.
In the comparison, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla allowed any misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in front of the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also presides over the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, who is now rated on the stock market with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk made it clear that he did nothing wrong, and that he was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, he might have taken the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share that the funding was secured.
Thus Tesla would have been rated at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk returned: Tesla will stay on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a outside chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor muscle communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel until 2021 as a chancellor
After the qualms of the past few weeks, the GroKo will collect several surveys.
The SPD falls back behind the AFD in a survey - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AFD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid-Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AFD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, have only 43 percent of the votes.
The large coalition has now lost the majority of the Sunday question in all the major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).

The range of the other parties is also large: the AFD, the second most powerful party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, and FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At the moment, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the office of the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BAMS showed.
Only every second (50 percent), according to the survey, currently wishes the large coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed a significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also consider that Merkel should again be a candidate for the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 percent of the Union's trailers want a candidacy, not 35 percent.
Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs stories - he should talk to Aldi about puremeat.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a place of acquaintance for the great love, exudes almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxer-shorts on the table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandkids than a mere Swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, in the first message you don't talk about the hot break for long?
Here's the amazing result.
The real Hollywood Lovestory potential is when the love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eyes-lost and recovered plot.
If the guy still reports to his worshippers at the e-mail address bio-putenmeid @ gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pudding meat."
For the faith in the magic of the analogue knowledge, she definitely deserves her happy end a la Hollywood.

Football: District League: Researchers' appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrhein makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
He was the coach of VfL Wolbeck's football team, and he retired (innerly) to sing about the lack of power on the green.
All the story.
In the meantime, it's going around the brandhoveweg again.
Baptism is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the past season only a little bit past the rise.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We have narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys and visited every one of them for the game to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more share of the game in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This would have been a great deal of revenge when the SCA in the minute 41 once in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbauer was dangerous in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.

Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.

When the old Rhine of Chris Naberbauer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 meters before the guest house there was an indirect free blow for the placemen.
The foulte himself came and demonstrated his vulnerability to standards.
Westhues "thing with the right sleep hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes to get the hell long.
And then that: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck, in the 80th minute, unhappily, flew the leather to his hand in the prison room.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Scared minutes had to survive in the final phase, before Geske had the victory on the shower in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it was too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26 L. Rehberg), Westhues, Wielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board of directors were female on the first day of September, as the report "The Power of the Monoculture," which was officially presented on Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was before the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Stiftung's CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, it is far from possible to think of purely male leaders - with a few exceptions.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women in the German stock exchange companies was also due to positive impulses for the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board of directors are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the last few years the proportion of women has stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked in the board of directors.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture is found in the Supervisory Board: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If you recruited as many women for the board of directors every year, you would have reached a 40% share in 2023," said the report.

This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöfer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 60.000 euros in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put a strong bet on it even in each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train to the opening of the 60th Abtwinder Weinfest
The Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine-festival session with a torch train.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which will rise every Saturday in October in the large festive tent on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge of the sound of the team train from Wiesenbronn moved through the place to the festival.
The president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz, and the wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already propensity-filled festive tent. "60 years of this - this is a great achievement for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "said Starz.
The wine princess Lisa II, later in a symbolic way, came out of the stage with the guests.
"It was nice that so many of us found the way to Abtswind." Later, "The Troggiers" made for the mood.
On Sunday, where the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the price of drinks as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guest, before a day later in the festive tent in the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerine was killed.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best to save people's lives.
Such a rescue mission took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notzarztauto had hit a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinhorn.
He then collapsed on a cross with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car sled against an amplitude and a tree.
He caught the passerine who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from the force.
The also severely injured 29 years old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried to do so - but without success.
The three severely injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After the blamable out of the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU 1: 3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is likely to give up.
The scene was in the 74th minute in which the reborn Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3: 1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an off-side at Mark Nobel's passport, all the defenses of Manchester stopped, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already far-reaching performance.
At the moment, the state of mind is quite different at Unite's city trivale Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to a undangerous 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling, for the home team, first broke the defensive bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1: 1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came on the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Better did Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his sledge.
After the Reds had started the week with an impeccable balance, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the London eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table by the remis in the league.
Like City, the two London clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which granite Xhaka played through, had to stand up to the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford-Defender Craig Cathcart made an unlucky contribution by Alex Iwobi to his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third saisontfeffer.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, passed Watford and is again directly behind the great rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave the ascender Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row at the 2-0 against Southampton.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a subject, but not a problem: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they show their new features from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel is no longer a big part of this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A large name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt is to be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart in 2019.
Officially, however, both were already presented.
The iNext of BMW is not to start until 2021.
The centre of Paris is the new 3.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 there were a million visitors.
In the case of the serious earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and huge damage has been caused.
After the quake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the peace church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, which is responsible for the pastoral interests of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September the last Sunday of a month the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the house Nordhelle will always take place.
The bikers are traditionally celebrating the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There on Sunday, about 150 bikers had come together to do anything other than ordinary worship.
From 10: 00, the Bolides were already set up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker-early shovels were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a strong currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also included.
The sermon held during the biker service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical painting.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic-quiet sounds," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing audience step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the field to the children, and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how to become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces that look like a hackle-like layer for a layer above each other.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step of work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already finished filled in specialties.
He opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchdorf" was accordingly large.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorfer camaradschaft of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited some stations to play short-term games.
The Heimatverein will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home in the heart of the asparagus village the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: after all, it will go around the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season broke: "Fake situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
There was a lot of positive before, however, at the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and went on to say, "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The more victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) met for the connection, are at the bottom with two meters and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
On the other hand, the first season home victory was held in Frankfurt, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (49.) reached the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful general trial for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, went up seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen in his first debut and never to get control of Handever's defense.
The storm, which was set after the World Cup for a long time, showed with its speed and ability to enforce, why it is so valuable for the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed by Liverpool, was the first to be in the early formation of the Frankfurter, which began to be a swinging one.
A headball of Lucas Torró (17.), which was falsified on the tornet, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failure of Kevin Wimmer (back).
The guidance for the house lords fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to the penitentiary after a turned-off corner, and Haller extended his head to the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller was looking after his storm partner Rebic, who was able to gas and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser had no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but sparing ideas remained out until the end, when the connection was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient there.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid on De Guzmán, who only had to put the ball in the empty gate.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against the challenged guests only a show run, and Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
In spite of cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185 in front of millions of people.
Munich Wies'n in the last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which comes from the 30-year-old war, which the legend of a Swedish soldier is supposed to have shot.
The gunshot wound then found blood.
This led to a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly visited despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service of God the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Cross Festival.
For many years the Catholic Church choir has then invited to the secular part of the feast to the Catholic parish house.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm holiday.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish community, informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage was more precise and the individual calls for tenders were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, as the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been identified, which has only been possible through the impression of the inside by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal work is completed, before the winter is to start with the natural stone work and one hopes to be able to finish half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Danube-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to his destination in the Münstergickstraße - all the people present agreed on the inauguration date.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have already been living in the home of the help of the Danube-Iller for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the people with mobile-cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved on to tear the house off.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new home
Around 4.6 million euros were invested in the new building.
The free state contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction works have remained in the planned framework - time and financial.
He was also thanked by the Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spade between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, which allows the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without any foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile."
The homelessness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And on the other hand, "The land in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in today's situation."
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers a space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
Stolz is the life-aid manager Heinz on the 11 full-time employees, all of whom are employed under tariff.
Germany: Schsig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has called on all the countrymen not to accept the disadvantage of East German.
There are differences that are painful after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said to the" day-to-day spiegel on Sunday. "
The objective should remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germany, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but had 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this puffy dog end the Korean police?
The one-year-old Pungan hunting dog is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their receiver on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in the middle of September in Pjöngyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of the memorial, has been the subject of numerous new books, which are most likely to answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthane, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the unofficial motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not, in the last place, promulgated the "return to material work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashier and other working citizens in this country to the justified question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to re-dedicate itself to its mission - to government - it should not be stopped now by means of definition debates.
If, after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks, the Union and the SPD can actually do something together, it is possible that Monday will show.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the issue of the diesel retrofitting and the law on the movement of workers is again on the agenda for conflict-related issues.
CSU Transport Minister Schreuer wants the car companies to get away with the exchange premiums in a slippery way, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has brought about an approximation over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned labour force immigration law.
The SPD calls for a lead-reduction perspective for refused asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another fight among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined together with the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society which is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests does not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, the argument must not be rebuilt for part-action reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight, but always have a look at the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
That is why the people's parties must now fight.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visitor
Does the Minister of Labour, of all things, violate the applicable law on services?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" had worked on the social security reform, a superstitious social security minister reported in the presentation of the latter two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) in the case of the list of mushroom-mandatarin Daniela Holzinger is a surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and that she did not want to announce any violations of the right of service in front of current cameras."
However, she now has questions to "acquit Har tinger from any suspicion."
Police are looking for a woman's body to open a street
Marx Grün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The line is still closed in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old man's bones, together with its leader, could finally limit the relevant position to a few meters in multiple applications.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing person's case.
A cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been disguised 30 years ago in the course of the new construction of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: Chamois in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be the first to be held.
But before that, there are claws.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, the centre of Barcelona has had a conflict between separatists and the police.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, by colour powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil forces wanted to honour their colleagues who were in use last year in the referendum in the electoral rooms, which was declared illegal.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the around 6000 separatists would have tried by force to break the police chain, and the officials would have been thrown with, among other things, colour bags and eggs.
Six people had been arrested and 24 others had been easily injured, they were called on to the authorities.
The first year of the independence referendum will be held on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-prison.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Countless: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are disconnected
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The closing light and the third last one, in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be unravelling.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without concern.
There was no risk of missing a Torchance, because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - possibility when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederick Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border.
The hosts were still harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48-minute period Sebastian Müttel was just over the housing from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloher also appeared for the first time openly.
After a ballernung of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented account about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a however a soft shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed with a headball by Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball by the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mütel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut tried to make the positive point: "I like that we played zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also in the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against wood wreaths and that, although our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensiv "everything was a little bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get an enemy, "said Daut.
As an audience, however, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too weak for that.
Reckfelder Harvest thanks market: Fortunately there are enough Kremmers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased about from the corner field table output point for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, while the place was still a little empty, but this should change in the course of the day.
Because, "Here it is so nice and sociable, so we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Franz Josef Holthaus festival welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which should actually be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer entered the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kremmers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to maintain the more and more visitors in the meantime.
That was so good that at the later hour some folk songs were sung.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, including mostly associations.
"In fact, there should be no such thing as a board," he thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other parties that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here is something.
Then the Maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klug with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stands were used for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupier saw.
Furnier work, beer lid with a corner field motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A specialty offered three fields of the beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey," brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bushkleiter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access it over and over again, so the cake tasted so good.
The sociality is the one that made the visitors stay long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skate
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably not been able to promote the construction of a skate plant in a very difficult way.
In several places there are similar lubrications, says Jürgen Küne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been filed with the police for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" were written on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding writing was discovered on the advertising plate at the entrance to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could have been removed without any problems.
"Only a few days later it was there, but this time it was sprayed up," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department of school, sport and culture, without name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the painted board.
For years, local policy and administration have been concerned with the subject of skate.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council, after all, expressed a majority in favour of the fire-fighting parking lot.
However, this approach has not been implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turning point followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kun says to the state of the art that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then is the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control is getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures is the long-known need for personnel in European air navigation, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pillows takes four to five years," said the trade union representative.
The market for fully trained pillows was wiped out throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that several air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the Federal Republic, the countries, the air traffic control, the airlines and the airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the federal German air traffic control system.
Maas once again made the EU Commission's guidelines responsible for the miseries of the pillows.
The transport forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost and human resources savings in the national air navigation services are now fully consistent with the operational business.
Maas called on the Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Schreuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air any further."
At present, the EU's targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further intensifications would be to be feared.
The EU was under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Ryanair's head Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would lead to a change of mind.
The GdF would only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offered a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The so far announced intake of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related exits.
The necessary staff structure is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting on Sunday, the critical group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two disappearances, the control body on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is the case with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police and Catalan leaders of independence.
In two similar demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan leaders of independence in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with many injured.
According to the city administration, on Saturday, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as well as about 6000 leaders of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a big effort.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates have repeatedly tried to break security.
They would have attacked the officials with color and shot.
According to the information, there were also links between the participants in the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police, with their demonstration, wanted to appreciate the colleagues who had taken action almost a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they called for better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers make much more money than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drugged us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty in the past year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the police assured.
Dispute allowed access to British Minister's personal data
A security gap in a mobile phone app has led to the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the break was announced one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people clung to B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on the German road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of the road Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The forces are on the ground.

Football: Juve Trainer praises for the top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star storm "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought-in star was also the decisive man in the important game against the persecutors without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and was doing well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three torches of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early backlog through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and for the time being depended on the worst persecutors.
The Torjäger from Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by head ball, also did the preparatory work for the hit of the head of the defense, Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach said.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to be even more pressing.
Seven victories in seven games is the impeccable series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples.
The table range, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not hopeless against Turin.
But at the latest after the space reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get on too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
She was also allowed to feel that Emre Can was there.
The German national player has made his way to Juve.

The midfield editor also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square at the 2-0 victory of the Turin and was closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly skurrile performance, Rapper Kanye West has brought attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" in the weekend.
Among other things, his common performance with Lil Pump was in a mineral water costume for headers and question marks with the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, it can only be called "Ye," the musician said.
"The being that was previously known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the late singer Prince, when he took his name from his artist.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe" Ye "is the most common word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
I did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not make a fuss out of his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more comfortable, we have almost never faced problems. "Accordingly, the list of Hoetmaar's shot options is read thin.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so that only rarely games can be made positive.
FC-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first Maik Krause used from a sharp angle to the early guided tour (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great preparatory work by Krause he was free to stand.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsterer Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (62) all gave up.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the door line and saw red - also Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests (75th).
It was only when Nils Berheide raised the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had been very critical before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," the conclusion of Florian Kraus was.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We don't have access to them at all." By which he was supposed to mean the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-white people who are looking up with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, wink and pulled from there to his players, however, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well, after a duel of two teams, one of which is albachts, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class maintenance.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA-Trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we get back after the 0: 2, how we keep against one of the top teams in the league all the time, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it is that you have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th Saisontfeffer (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he placed on the left side in a pattern valid for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"This was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without any hesitation.
Shortly before the change of the side, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free-blow from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Toorkeeper Hinkerohe into the long torque (45.).
After the change of the page it was McGill again, who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a tight, action-loaded game.
Näch shocked albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like (69.).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45..), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nahe (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straße berg is fighting point against Primus

Media: The entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to the media reports, the entire Bureau of the second player, Dynamo Dresden, has resigned.
In the evening, several media agreed on a joint letter from the panel of the Saxons.

The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligiist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests, whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest for three days in Berlin and Cologne, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy of Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
The term of office for Christian Wulff was too short: as the Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Akademie Director Udo Hahn, when he said proudly, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellor were already with us." The fact that the Academy at the Tutzing Castle shows up again and again celebrities, however, was also a theme in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wacker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed to receive the "Tolerance Prize" he received from the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a daily title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean."
"And at a meeting on Syria:" Barbarians without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war harms every human idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change in work through digitalisation.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."

The next birthday of Karl Marx will be the one to expect more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, the other to expect a tendency "from the left to the center."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church of the State," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender communication with heart - Wolbeck - Western Fairy News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the room of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner began to understand the gender, not only with humor and heart heat for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man, and what else may exist, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used them and also master their violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverküp.
This is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrup Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
That's what happened, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that's how the red thread of the evening was.
Then Teubner had put a paradox in the game: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but it does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart's composing, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, in improvisations, Süverkrup glides from Bach's "O Head of Blood and Wounds" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's g-minor symphony into a playful dance.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz little one, treasurer of the club, the chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markbeck, was not able to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a show in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, as well as one in Wolbeck.

"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only a player has made too many goals.
We didn't get a hold of them, "said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more concerned about the many opportunities that were left out.
The concentration in the end missed his team this time.
The ASG was therefore almost after a backlog until the end, at the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45) behind.
Only towards the end was the wider bank of the hostesses made a decisive contribution.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschheit (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-league club VC Allbau Essen, the Blue-White won with 3: 1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out this, "Trainer Dominik Münch was looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage was dominated by guests almost as they wish.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year with 25: 15.
Food has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV led already with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't hold the impact.
Food has soaked, and we have let ourselves in a little bit, "says Munch.
At 18: 17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose in front for the first time.
In the 19: 24, Ostbevern was still able to defend four of the stingballs, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the exercise leader was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge, with their impact, contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Munch: "We played there consistently and quietly."
About 7: 3 and 15: 13 the blue-and-white passed through four with 25: 22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachauer also had a great day.

International: Turkish community: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne, in the German-Turkish relationship, has left a shrew of shreds, which can only be brought together in a difficult way," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, reconcilable appearance.
"Instead of on the side with German leaders to underline the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The wide-ranging exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, Folktreff time is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7: 30 p.m., the Nottuln home club is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the Chamber of the Old Office.
Almost to the very day it is then a year ago that we did a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar in Nottuln, "Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the office mannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is as always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sea songs, folk songs, Evergreen's and old battles," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion for the first "birthday" of the Folk.
He was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the district of Steinfurt, who played music with platGerman texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk meeting are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche at night," inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We are counting on many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," is said in the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and is interested in active involvement is invited to participate.
As the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there in time.
The Folktreff starts at 7: 30, but the entrance is already at 7: 00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step on the way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the number of permits in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the US are still in place for the million-dollar merger.
In the last place, the chances of an insider's consent had improved, because Linde has promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October to ensure that the merger is successful.
From pure fruit-growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year existence of the district association for horticulture and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with an fruit show in the Kulmbach Vereinshaus, the last founding impulse for the district association for horticulture and land care Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach city hall on Saturday night.
In 1893, he was raised from the Baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa, as the "district softbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" ("district softbausverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land").
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually pure about the fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture at the time no one was thinking.
"At that time, in the age of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Günter Dippard, the district-home nurse in his sermon.
Fruit trees should moan long-distance, so-called industrial gardens have been created in schools.
Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as the provision of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mulschreibung" have shown how many different the areas of the work of a gardening association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the district president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experience in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the district council decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also the district manager and professional consultant Friedhelm Haun had no doubt about it.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and for the winter it was docked.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we must focus on it," said the expert on fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let down, so that our home will remain beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian Association of State, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful feat, which was solemnly framed by the turbo blades of the music association Thranau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister replaces UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in the matter of Nafta: they are an ultimatum for an agreement between the two trading partners.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and moves her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, informed her.
In the meantime, they are focused on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that Canada and the US negotiators had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed to a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they will now be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives after a report of the daily "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public action in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in the beginning of September during an election campaign in South Brazil on the open street.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks too, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and women's disdain statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and should not therefore be allowed to apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the extreme right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in the policy-making process for a long time, but has recently been presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of the election reach the absolute majority, there will be a vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for being against homosexuals and black people and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left workers' party should be shot.
Europe is getting Ryder Cup titles back
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Only an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the bed of death.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasoline ', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen appreciated Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewrite of the rocky live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the citizens' center of the shoe factory near: Hardry pure of three friends.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of Lampenfeiber.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - are very enthusiastic about the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince the opening of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of his own feather and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to a consistent and busy interplay.
Although "Admission" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the trio "Here We Stand" to the stage.
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with her alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" the "Tigers" is used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is used.
Not only the longing, straight-to-ballast "Take Me Home" impresses by changing melodic passages to the guitar-hard rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a special level of awareness since its creation in 2005.
The band will be presenting its hard rock on Saturday with full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and inaudible.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the '80s.
For the sound that has been felt even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a juicy solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of this in a hard-rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to the mixed-part team, is located at the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air hammer, but it is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals," which point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear-deafening 120 decibels in nozzle-shaped blue strength as usual for the annual metal-setting in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need this rock night, however.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, though in the transferred sense, say in the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a sailplane accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim / Essen airport there was a fatal accident.
A sailing plane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailing aircraft had crashed at the fair park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on the landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a fixed site on the airport grounds.
But a October Festival has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly at the entrance to the 52nd motorway
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the Essen trade fair or the Gruga hall in Essen.
Trump inspires Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea, Kim, is well-sensed despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
But now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The tragic thing is, it's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, in public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprouts of the Pjöngjang ruling dynasty, although the one in the ring around North Korea's nuclear disarmament proved to be quite tough.
"I was tough, he was tough, too, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also had political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all the nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip acquaintances.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - is not to be any memory, seemed to be well aware of the US President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it at his performance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling in advance: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he took care of it very little, explained Trump and then pointed his finger to the crowd: "I always told you that it is so easy to be present."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, atmospheric as well as on top of it spoiled by sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre on Sunday cleaned out.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festive tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya by means of a mobile phone video, allowing them to be saved.
The group had shot the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under the threat of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his fellow leaders was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their home country this year using the programme, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved was not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a call for help by phone video.
International organisations have been criticising the state of the Libyan refugee camps for a long time as unworthy of human dignity.
The North African state, which is dominated by large parts of the militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

The teacher informed the police that the investigation was taking place.
Whether things have been stolen or money cannot be said yet.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to stay in his car in a forest area in the middle of France for several days and nights after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, rescue forces discovered the car near a meadow and released the missing person since Tuesday night, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was found to be in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his ground car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has, according to his own information, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries were currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns, above all, arrest waves, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition for this."
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan had once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved in the short term to a building that was ready to fly from the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the Schloss had rejected it for political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuklearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a meeting with Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent halt is that the US is building on forced measures that are deadly for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean Chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could "force its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri stressed.
On the US side, however, there had been no "corresponding reactions," the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone in the past year had decided three times on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days at the United Nations called for strict compliance with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again be travelling to Pyongyang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT received nothing from it: white blankets and flower muck on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone did it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It is not better to cook," a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have done," said Father Frank Beckmann, while the sorcerer Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, made for astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board
The head of the Essen board, Jörg Sartor, has made his position in the national association, out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen board had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW panels, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday."
I've had too many of them in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswis, has expressed an understanding of the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there are people who did not know exactly why the Food Table is doing it."
But Sartor was still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswich said.
In the "World on Sunday," Sartor again criticised colleagues from other tables.
You should not follow the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fucks who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2: 0 tour - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a backlog - Bettringen strikes Lauchheim clearly.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly reached the rear with 0: 1, but after 90 minutes won with 2: 1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to get a 3: 0
Gladbach plays a two-time tour - Schalke without Empolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outside victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 the foals play a tour twice.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke has manoeuvred with early counter-tower to the side.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again put the strength on the day with which it had the first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home quipe in the eleventh minute after a strong preparatory work by Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, the hosts then preserved the mini-poster with a compact defence performance.
Borussia Dortmund welcomes again from the top of the Bundesliga thanks to an extraordinary comeback.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0-2 backlog against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the season the 4-2 victory was still in place.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) were in four minutes with a double, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided a further double in the final phase (86th / 94th) for the crowning completion of the increase in power after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgart authorities had to be afraid of the German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-German-.
Borna Sosa and the inconspicuous Goalie Ron-Robert target produced a curious impact-self-tor that helped the guests in the 68th minute to balance.
The VfB was won by Gonzalo Castro seven minutes later.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who entered with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a tour twice, played 2: 2 in the end, and still waiting for an outside victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation for the 1: 1 season with his second Bundesliga.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargau, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second match after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are quite tolerable.
Alassane Pléa is seen as a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
The French record purchase, which was made by the OGC Nice, met Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is the fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Wader Bremen was manoeuvring against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first Saisontfeffer, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to give his team: the 23-year-old Serbe caged after a jersey-didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart's defenses Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert target brought the Bremer back into play by a curious impact-own (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the excess of the Stuttgart garter back to the winning road.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether the name of their country should be changed in North Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three decades of fading conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-prison.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrer brutally beat three retired women and thus injured them in some cases.
The 41-year-old asylum-seeker had landed on Friday around 10: 00 in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went to the passers with his fists and tried to attack them, to his behaviour.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground just before in the Wärminger Straße at a tram stop.
In addition, he had kicked the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were in part severely injured.
They had hematomas, bruises, and concussion.
The asylum-seeker was also severely injured "for unknown reasons," as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored during treatment.
SPD-Politicians: Johannes Kahns Marries His Friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the Jawword.
A registered life partnership had not been considered for them, Kahr had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the political spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the "Seehamer Kreis," the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahs had aroused a fury of attention on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"This was your Schabovski moment," he said in a reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabovski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Kinderhaus and the Society of Leprakkunde.
For around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the farm should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about 12 supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce the costs," said the Chairman of the Citizens' Association Walter Schröer.
And there have been so many of them.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape.
Because already in the spring one has already shaved the hedge.
The breakfast that always follows the work has a long tradition.
"They should all remain strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.

Two years ago, he had missed Olympia bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough trips here on the plant and it all fit today, "said the Olympic third of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms to the height more victorious - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had a start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not topple his fable time of 89.69 seconds.

The police inspection Gauting reports the first attempt to break in this autumn into a single family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to use again.
So yesterday the police inspection Gauting reported the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it has remained at the one-family house on the Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators put their hands on Friday just before 8: 00.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system surprised her so much that she took the escape without a prey.

Plute at Hertha: Retrieved from reality: Bavaria against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin "does not want to fall to the FC Bayern."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance models under the new coach Niko Kovac should not in any way increase to the larger autumn low for the Munich people.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught up with us, "said Thomas Müller after the earned 0: 2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know we're really upset about this and we're going to take it to Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year, no one's own goal was shot out, as at the same time in the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table tour in the Bundesliga for the first time lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berlin through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered within three days two blueprints, as the last powerful Bavaria are to crack.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we are not going to let this happen and we will do everything we can to be successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown, and his first defeat as a Munich coach was only on the again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would, however, be the first step in his term of office before the country's break - otherwise the tone would probably get worse.
= = = Benfica Lisbon = = = Kovac did not take any special measures before the second king-class performance of this season after 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-match against Ajax, which had also forced the AEK Athens to start with 3: 0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost poker final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke clear text.
The legal defender played the role of a Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," said the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria were even behind Dortmund with five meters, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so Kimme, with a wink of the eye, was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan denies the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious allegations.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
A new item is now to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the term-theme Mesut Özil on different stages.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the former World Champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB-Chef defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Özil personally attacked Grindel in the Mainz ZDF- "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, we need to draw very precise conclusions that this is not happening again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they had me photographed in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the city.
To be honest, as her president, I could not digest that our two young men, who went up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "well treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to present himself to players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - I can't."
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
He does not see a basis for the return of Özil to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football, and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he will again be running for the post of DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as I can," said Grindel.
Annual builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10: 00 and 1: 00.
The 75-year-old driver was first mentioned by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauterer's height.
She told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call about a car driver who would have gone off the road and hit a central post.
In response, the man did not want a police officer on the ground and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, in which he has lived for decades, has gone to trial and, at the time of the change, has a construction vehicle.
After all, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a crazy impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorfire in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defence site in Emsland, 980 forces are still working on the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to a speaker, the situation has continued to develop in a stable way, the last 70 volunteers have been withdrawn.
It is said that a further reduction in the number of forces is planned.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put forests and settlements in danger by wind and radio.
On Thursday, it was said that a fire attack on adjacent communities would no longer threaten.
In time, more than 1500 forces tried to control the large fire on the ground.
The Luftwaffe will continue to support the work on the Federal Defence Test Site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5th of October, according to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned.
The fire was triggered by the test rockets that fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke of the Moorbrand had moved to Bremen for a time up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD-Politicians: Johannes Kahns Marries His Friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the Jawword.
A registered life partnership had not been considered for them, Kahr had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the political spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the "Seehamer Kreis," the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahs had aroused a fury of attention on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"This was your Schabovski moment," he said in a reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabovski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has started.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens has blocked any approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give a start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016 and leaves a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for the afterworld.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden of members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, stresses Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden of people in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need of a Swiss plant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, institutions can only be taken away with explicit consent, stresses Swiss transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donation card, says Franz Alle, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks the family do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You will then have to decide in an alternate manner in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says always.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the speaker of the Federal Centre for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völger-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or counter-organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered to be an organ donor, unless he or she were opposed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in head-counting.
He was in Wolfsburg for the weekend against 39 co-strikers.
This was announced on Sunday by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greß from Germany took third place.
The most recent World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest to have a 74-year-old retired from France, as the main judge Ralf Laue said.
The informatics professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
To date, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants against guests from the audience came up with a calculator.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he kept a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or child of wonder, the organizer Laue can not start much.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants had a number of hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even accounting competitions in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
In the case of versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here too the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asian people are often in the advantage, because in the early age of the child head-extracting is learned more intensively and with other effective methods.
Impressive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows up from her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and make a strong contribution to early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover up their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer recognition that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
When her daughter Alexis Olympia was born, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serenas's lung were then discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polare cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
The first time in the West next week, Mrs Holle is shaking out her beds: Polare cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the Meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), at the beginning of the week the snow fall to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at a strong intensity.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, it is expected to be more than 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
This means that the road conditions are winter on the higher-lying pass (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlopass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße).
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knitting on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual knitting on Monday.
The "green forest" in Germany has been the landscape of the Waldarmen Bundeslandes for about 200 years.
The "Walderset" and the last retraction rooms for many animals and plants are the tree and rock hedges up to five meters wide.
Knicks are a corridor of scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the German Nature Protection Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of a command of the King of Denmark, Christian VI, in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitations and livestock fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
His name "Knick" is also from that time: By "kneeling" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, there are about 45 000 kilometres of hedges and the image of a wooded, diverse-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a spare space.
In one kilometer of Kick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it will become a light series of trees, which in addition to the variety of species also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knitting care may only be carried out outside the gross period from October to March.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about sition on site
In the interview with the German Editorial Network (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up something provisional, where we also have other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, on which they still remain for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some of them are in front of their homes, and there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are partly stealing food and petrol.
The public service is completely down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the prisoners are free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people, who do not know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami met the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific fire ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against weatherners: VfB must give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had drawn a muscle fibre tear in the back left thigh at the 2: 1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
In the case of Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss even after the following season.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundling tear usually heals out within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre tear usually heals up a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the most prestigious European festivals are closed every year.
In spite of all singing to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, in particular with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract a lot of attention with Hollywood Oscar candidates, San Sebastian also provided one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire department tried to catch a wounded duck.
The action, however, took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walks on the Olchinger Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station.
To help the animal, the passers called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to catch the duck went wrong, however.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and move it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a heated handle.
The duck was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleissheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
In the coming winter the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia Sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to the catch.
Seven tenths were missing in the end on bronze.
"I have deliberately given myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in great shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the line in the heart," he remembers with joy his fourth world cup place in the single race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start-up competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at the Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are trying to secure the very thin majority for the court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who was in charge of the charges.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that are more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama about the vocation of Kavanaugh accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first lawyer, Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the jurist has been in a rage against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Committee on Justice should clear the way for the final confirmation of the Supreme Court of the Supreme United States.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After a series of scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had referred to the heavy speeches on Thursday as "a call," initially contained further attacks against women and on the contrary spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, the final doubt could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election campaign, Trump attacked the democrats sharply because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will specifically examine the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar of the city community of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the time limit, is, according to the city community, stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed Radarboxen.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on shalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our prison room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Royal Blue had still succeeded in bringing the 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given safety to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In total the first half-time was good, both playful and from the pressing.", with the increasing duration of the game, the head obviously played a role more and more.
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to get it out of their hands and therefore they were still moving on.
And defended against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who did not have an insignificant part of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man-made."
But in the end, all that matters is victory.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start off in the early stages with pressure and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
At last we can be happy for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to go to games for over 90 minutes
The biggest lack of the afternoon: King Blue missed to ensure more clear conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konptyanka, who met twice the latte 59. / 72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a snitch victory," said Tedesco, "the fear has already been felt a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker with that.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at 1.30 p.m. saw a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out the police and the fire department: an unknown one had burned waste on a two-square-metre area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the gluten unsupervised.
And that near the forest.
30 Fisherbachau firefighters were engaged in the conflict and the deletion.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is in front of them.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the repeated time.
"I have had the task of bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - that association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani is very relaxed in reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some kind of joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The syrishy-like author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits on a table, and the first-generation migrants on the catfish.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not a matter of deciding whether to sign up to the right or to the left, but of "Am I for or against an open society?," he stresses.
In the beginning, it is more and more the discussion is starting.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is ahead, not on stage, of a sense of discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not press his opinion, stresses that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the following signing hour, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively further discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win the opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an outside victory.
In a hard-fought game in its own hall, Gießen fought against the Mitteldeutsche BC with 91: 84 (43: 46).

On Friday, Munich already had to make a 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84: 80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new building area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 land areas that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Some 100 applications had been received, said Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger Mayor, the aim was to have the candidate rankings for the 20 land by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
In total, 50 land areas for single and double houses are created in the area in the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight residential units.
The development is now almost completed, the roads and roads are to be asphalted in the near future.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 land in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 free-state-funded income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
Grossly estimated is created on the area of the new building area Landsham-South living space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a children's day place is done there.
It is intended to accommodate three children's garden and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
So Schalke's Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo does not thank Domenico Tedesco for the first time in a row.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre-old Brazilian had really talked about the soul's frustration.
But after the 1-0 win over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker player gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call simple Naldo, turned in and said: "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve existence, had no grudge.
Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shalker in the last season, knows that he did not actually get on the staging track with his coach - but for good reasons he received a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I'm telling you the truth," Tedesco told me about the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the Startelf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the association, "Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that at the moment, everyone can get through it.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo caught the last time.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also acting as an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to speed up its decline in August compared to the euro area.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month climb.
However, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Marit Institute reported to 3,000 companies on Monday for its survey.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro area increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, so the index is still the 13th month in a row below the mark of 50 meters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride may mean that the worst is over," said Marit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry, in the third quarter at least, remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in a row of jobs.
In China, industrial production also fell more than initially assumed in August.
