No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish, as part of a revision of the Criminal Code, those paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the arrested Prime Minister, rejected the Members at the second reading of the application for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final; in December the appeal of the convicted will be brought to trial.
Tymoshenko himself refers to the judgment as the political revenge of the regime, and in the West too the trial led to the suspicion of the court's bias.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of the Libyan liberation campaign or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is common for this region, in the elections Islamists are victorious, the question is which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council made a commitment to the law of the Scharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, if any, they should be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Koran from one another's command tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable here.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best, and it would hardly fit the above-mentioned Libya.
In this way it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could be helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To her excuse may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a change of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from the military occupation of Libya.
This is a concern for the hiesigen - the expulsion of the cruisers.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price even without the occupation?
It is hardly possible for the West to boast of the protection of human rights with the right of its selflessness.
If this does not destroy the Scharīa representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe are the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm was needed through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy was stagnating compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France are increasing.
But today the bond market is breaking all the records.
The investors are not only in the eyes of Greece, but also of Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% and by 0.4% in France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than was originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France allowed a slight fall of 0.1% (initial data were only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend in the growth slowdown in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
In the whole euro area and the EU, the economy recorded a growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of the analysts.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year-old government bonds was 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are loud that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has been the most difficult task for the whole season!
Thanks to a well-designed goaltender Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great amount of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious head start from the home game and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1: 0 thanks to the final weakness of the home, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football EM.
Due to the precise defence game of the Czech team, they could not put more pressure on the Montenegrins until the second half of the year.
The game's unlucky birds were Damjanovic and Vucinic, the two huge opportunities being lost.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European championships next year, and it is also a pleasure that a premium of about 200 million will be paid to local football.
From the first few minutes, quite a fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home force was left out, and the long-term declines in front of the criminal space were successfully rejected by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core program of their country.
They made a living sign.
Some hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday at noon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Ishahan formed on Tuesday a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Ishahan, where uranium is being processed.
They wanted to tell them that they are prepared to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had not, in all likelihood, abandoned its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, we are talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
On the afternoon before the entrance to the complex, students had prayed and then declared death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack which was intended to put the Iranian nuclear programme to a large extent, the Israeli press from the centre of Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The menu of a greedy child: it does not breakfast and eats sausage for the evening bread
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9% of all students and 5% of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have shown that, most of the children are from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families in which normal children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the eve of the education action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" to the evening bread.
In families with fat ones, sport is not exactly one of the most popular activities, but as far as the majority of today's students are concerned, only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence," which is supported by the General Health Fund and the Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors responsible for the frightening increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children interviewed, for example, said, five times a day, in the mode of eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-Vesper evening bread - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of the families of the students had breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that every tenth family does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the basis of healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families you consume overweight children much more often unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are sports, only less than half of their parents do - that is, only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to set up their own food plan from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many meals of flour, meat dishes and, of course, sweet food.
"Alarmingly, the great popularity of sweet lemonades is above all," is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta was won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits when they get proper information.
"In the survey group, which completed the questionnaire after the opening of the" Adipositas is not a coincidence, "there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," is mentioned in the project's results.
This was the case for example with the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were prepared to eat less noodles or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a little bit of a joke that it was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
I want it to get worse.
The closer the examination, the more information and practical tasks we have to do.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
And these are most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves, and others are chubby again.
It is a matter of stylist to claw wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to expel the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large bosses, broad hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-stressed, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so large that the skirt or pants really doesn't fit, you should at least be cut one piece to a size.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the poles that always slips up and down, in which waist stands, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bushes, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad that I have a whole week to let it all go through my head.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the light of the homework.
In fact, each of the students was given a celebrity for which she should make up the appropriate outfits - day clothing and evening drobe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm cheering inside, because this is a lot better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard," as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models in a purely physical way, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific requirements, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was also seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
from the stylist Jan Pokorný, from the fashion maker Jakub Polanka and from the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a skilful stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is called variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear the shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to break all these courses, what you can combine with something and why, even though you often get to see different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a ten-page fashion story (ten outfits) to style at least 15.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes represent half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
All you need is Madonna to watch a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be out-of-date money (the main thing is that I bring something I look like is second-rate).
And if one of us can already be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to have a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevardpress writes that the corresponding celebrity has gone back to or lost, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate with the people he styls and he must be a wise psychologist.
To assess people without offering themselves and stand by his opinion.
"If any manager ordered us to look at her wardrobe and to complement her pretty pieces, then we can't clear out the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some commendable things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "space bag" must contain.
So it's a bag that you can tie to the waist and carry all the necessary properties with you.
Apart from such clear things, such as scissors, scaffolding for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats from), special clips with which the clothes are rigged in the back if it is too large (plugs or other terminals are prohibited to make the fabric not break) and of course sewing gear.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly wear shoes.
Even when taking pictures in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
Oh, we clung and clung...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors so that you don't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario made me happy by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to deal with styling at a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree drive is made by a series of completely preventable, dilettantic errors to the routine drive to the early shift.
Although it has been possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, what good is it if no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already-year "Need for Speed" game series back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not actually seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the way the enclosed passages fail, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But the way you're used to it at NFS is, in the end, much different than you expected.
Sure - it is potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible folly of the game developers in principle.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is carried out on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to feel that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very pretty, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or high above through deep snowy landscape works visually very pleasant.
From time to time untypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stop watch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are involved in, trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (in fact only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model passes in the footboards of the previous parts.
In other words, from the point of view of today, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand it could not be said that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to be quite fair to an action-loaded race, even though one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only occur after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object know how the car behaves, then obviously it's not all right.
Typical example: When moving close to the front or to the front of the front of the car, one "strives" the other cars in some places only easily, but in other, almost identical situation you get into the sludges and turns wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's all very annoying.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the line.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you've exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work out, but you better not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, there is nothing to help but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to be run in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always met in the same configuration at the appropriate location, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contestant passes by two coming cars before a play, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The competitors have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and again here without regard to the time.
This is the most crazy thing to do at the end of the game on the long bridge that you happen in the opposite direction.
The contestant has to get you out of here on the devil.
And when he's in front of you, he takes the view, of course, so that you drive your own car a few times in the first place.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly gives you the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game as a whole is quite entertaining and, on the other hand, so much so that you don't know where your head is.
And in principle, no matter what "debt" is to it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that cannot cause boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car in the course of the races.
You must not miss the gas stations on the line, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the serpentine in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, various objects must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected to the online autologous function, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get to a subway tunnel (because of me) by car, where you run long in the dark on the tracks (because of me).
On the tacho there are numbers between 150 a 200 km / h (because of me), but there comes a subway from the back and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial group, we will probably have a long time to argue about whether this was a blackout of the game design or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that in some exciting moments the frequency of the image is slowing down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This is, however, particularly the case of accidents with a greater number of persons involved, where a continuous FPS is of no use to you anyway.
The sound is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "was created by everyone something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game was not reduced by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have argued with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared to see that these mistakes are stabbing into your eyes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "students of the collective revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festa Academica Festival now offers for the third time the quickening of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this, including the music experience.
During the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university chors will present themselves.
The festival will focus on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"The University of Charles has a great share of the festival."
"Among the participants, the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies is also represented and, among other things, the Rector Václav Hampl is in the festival committee," led the head of the organization team, Jakub Čaloun.
The final highlight of the festival is the public concert of school chors, which will take place on November 17, from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech Jazzer Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass."
In the evening hours, in the gallery rooms of the People's House in Vinohrady, the concert "Students of the Holy Revolution" (Studenty sametu) is not excluded from the choirs of the Charles University.
Festa Academica is the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Holy Revolution, but to present choir music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of the Charles University, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
The schedule includes also numerous music meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the various institutions felt."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn out. "
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth and all to get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her speech, in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have envied such a teacher of the Faculty of Law of the University of Charles.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who had not grown up to such a role, but I must say that it has begotten everyone's breath of how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a man who is ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them, and who, above all, has a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: who is it - the European Union? What number should I call? ", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards States, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil mites from quargels
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and plans to live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative, which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was rather hectic not only in the Presidency but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
The EU's seven-year budget has yet to be approved, which makes it much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe."
"If I don't like something, it's a cruel shortcut, a stranger, and a professional jargon that no one understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether you really think of crooked or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from quarrels?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive side.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are responsible for this, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Ungar comes to me and a Slovak is near, the Frenchman next to me says," Hey, what are your heads together - is that your V4 again? "and it makes a pretty sour mime.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU will expect to see more stringent rules for the Member States' budget policy.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more real than a "European Federation."
"Here we have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those who do not want it should stand aside."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong" Europe of different speeds, "Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole need to be discussed by all Member States and not just by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its foundation a century has passed.
The foundation of this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand to play the life of the future giants (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was started to be published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and also society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already in the thirties social care for his employees - in the same way as the entrepreneur Baźa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees a vacation, an insurance company plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for best new and dealer.
IBM's long-term relations with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was a genius in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies in the world to raise any discrimination - and could therefore choose to do so.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
This has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken the position of the head of the veto, marketing and strategy.
IBM has made so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, as the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and the outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony from consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue," has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code or also the diskette.
With about $220 billion of market capitalisation, IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with Microsoft overtaking it for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, the attempt with the own OS / 2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not emotionally commit to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano says.
That is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Prospects for success
IBM's profits are a major contribution to services, software and hardware.
In 1990, hardware with a more than five percent share was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time, it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-looking technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the new financial crisis for the first time swept the world like a storm.
This is where IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the great global economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be able to survive today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in missile terms since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
IBM's company slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is why it is also possible to expect this flexible giant to master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was only taken over in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, the history of which dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous card watches to register the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also the chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even put the founder of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutting, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the chair for the whole forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's technicians and computers helped lead NASA flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 to the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System / 360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultation part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of "smart planet."
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform to help the dealers run the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Central Bank is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top research team dealing with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtáç (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosy dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had given refuge to singer I Bartošová in her own house, she would not have even thought of the way that this was going with her husband.
When Iveta went out after 30 days, and went back to říčany, Joseph went with him.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reunite with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytáż it doesn't matter who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtáç Iveta left Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already been emotionally separated from him and insists on mutual resistance alone.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door, Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I am talking to Darina in a normal way, but we do not share the bed," said J. Rychtáż (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take over all responsibility.
The worst female indecency: what about you?
When you ask men to call some typical female unvirtues, they shake out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unseated revue pass again, which make the men roll the blood in the veins?
Purchasing
Does your husband accuse them of being on the market?
Do you have to buy at least one hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a little more in the case of actions?
Then in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping spirit under control.
But hand to the heart, which woman can already stand to be bummed by a dress shop in the cabin in search of a well-sitting upper clothing and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told your husband?
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start to jog or do gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you must be one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife is always whining about her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Are you complaining with your partner, because he is again tramping with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, did you shackle the children, because the sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet has fingerprints again, when the polishing is so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "currency," you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first priority.
This meticulous purity can in the end also damage the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Scouts
"Dirty gymnastics come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put your old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised that it will bring him to the palm.
Of course that's not a bad idea, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, the women might not need to complain so much.
Klatsch and Trachsch
Some women like to clap and scratch, there is a clandestine behind their back, or even slanderous, or you make alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to focus on such issues, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think each of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand to heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clatter's greatest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who, especially for women, are a significant threat.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
The ice hockey player Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5-3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina in the assembly of the NHL, and is thus the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Gioux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was the beneficiary of the review of the 90-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had a great evening prophesied to Gioux.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him that he's going to get a Hattrick today."
I kind of felt that. "
"From time to time such a feeling happens," said Jágr, after his action Gioux already reached a gate at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail."
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first-third-off, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hander, but the second-third was the flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third goal, and after that, Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I would not have thought in life that at the end of my career I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as I did with him."
"I'm so glad."
"I'll cut my game to me."
"All these years in the NHL, my players set their game on me, and now the skewer turns," Jágr smelled.
Carolina made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who made his way out of a penalty shot, it came to a gate.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acts in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride, and (Read) went to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and am glad that it worked," Voráček described the last match of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and in the second third he left because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candies, in addition to their experienced Beck, also paid their leadership an unlost in the Penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the sanctions.
More than the lost points probably hurt the home coach the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they only finished the game with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"At each change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defenses.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
There were five different shooters in the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, the ČSSR had only five approved state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies were only selling travel to the socialist East Bloc countries, and in the West they were allowed only to choose.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one could also travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechoslovakia) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the way things had gone.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of the Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that still lasts today.
The collective revolution of 1989 followed a rice revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers were sleeping on a trip to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had the money to stay in the hotel or in a pension at the time.
A typical feature of Czechs abroad was a trunk packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of living and therefore the average salaries increased, which in 1997 ended up in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights after 1997, making the flights incredibly cheap in comparison to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had unsolicited payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-collected" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was taken to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying every year in far-away sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 000 Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely brought our country into line with the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 000 CZK per head for a single holiday, including the cost of the holiday place.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a patent is threatened.
For almost five months, Czech football has not been a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
The vote will take place at the next voting time.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek the old quails between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the trial did not result and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with a power of authority.
In this single point, at least part of the agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in the opinion of the Court, was not admissible.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
The Executive Committee also no longer made it clear that the meetings of the Executive Committee - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle no more on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: what should be done in the third round to avoid a patt situation?
"The point of dispute concerns the question of whether to act in accordance with the Statute or whether a completely different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the management.
According to the legislative model, in the third round, the candidate wins the greater percentage of support in the chamber he is running for.
Moravia is supposed to be prepared to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side that it would be best not to turn the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
It is surprising that Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even though it is clear that the legislative electoral order is the most likely to meet Pelta from all the candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to avoid the idea of a stupid replacement variant, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time is running for it and in his comments was mainly to the Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If the football first rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to work together is also greater," says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience of all three Adempts, at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately divisive."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to" redirect "the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a new block at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will eventually prevail," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete up to the qualification game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance, and so one was looking fibbly for a replacement, how to bring part of the Executive Committee still to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
In the end, then, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have brought the divided parties to an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
There is a great deal at stake: state subsidies, the confidence of Czech football and the forthcoming General Assembly of ČSTV, which is to take the new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football players before the extraordinary general meeting could have made a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic's football association (FAČR), he would not have agreed to the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a breath," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, coming to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory he intends to perform the role of the chairman for only one year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too involved in football.
"I have spoken to some people in question in person."
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík claims to disrupt the connection of Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' arrangements on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have taken the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be conserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also points to the fact that Pelta's name fell in connection with phone calls to investigate in a corruption affair some time ago, but that Pelta was unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (tsch.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier words, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but he already sees something more late.
If Paclík was to win in the Thursday election, he could, however, imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could well imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to run the association as a manager."
"I did not put my nose in matters that I do not understand," said Paclík, who in September had made a point of view that he was at the top of the call of the Arbitration Commission with Luđěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the President of the Association is growing.
And it is based on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which can be found in a situation that is in a situation of conflict," said Paclík, who does not make a fuss out of his antipathy, for example, towards the Sparta head Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities was to consolidate the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help him to lobbying the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should be devoted to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to say in a very clear way where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, even though he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR must be "over-partisan."
In turn, Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Rajchl is connected to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I do not think it makes much sense, however, to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person, in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made it clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would rule out a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the President's Office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would be strong enough to give the FAČR a new statute that would in future rule out disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday trial in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly disarm in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would focus on the national team and the financing of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, and so he liked the two-month break to help him defend his ideas of the management of football and to introduce him in a wider context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, says the man who is mainly connected to the Jablonecer Club, but who also worked for Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
That is why he also thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the Euphoria is responsible for today's problems with the election, which was in power at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the general meeting in June approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September, "said Pelta.
In particular, he used the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association as a means of relief for the delegates.
"If I am to be a chairman, I will take it personally and I will be prepared to take responsibility personally if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
He is also not trying to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent was his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to some successes. "
"However, his attacks were depressing and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"For that reason too, many are now in doubt about his real character," said Pelta to his opponent, who is likely to remain faithful to his proclamation, which he expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemian to the descendants of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Right after that, I would run into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his move into the top of Czech football would not mean any human cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the long anarchy, there is, understandably, nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If it really is the only controversial point to choose in the third round, then we will get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only gains it back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president, Jindřich Rajchl, was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association at the general meeting on Thursday, it would seem to be a great deal of people in the association to be in a mood.
In fact, Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and otherwise continue the work that the previous president Ivan Hašek has started.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to the performance football for the youth. "
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks to make football progress in every segment with milestones. "
Many would not be very excited about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to run for any more.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not throw my feet in the open and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"This is trust that cannot be lost," he said.
He is also supposed to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a great deal of work and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There have been processes that probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just hate to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action, and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"There are people behind him who would make the football in such a way that he would only be there for the chosen."
I guess you can blame me for some things, but not for being party. "
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for all, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for moors."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the role of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its vice-chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of million crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not move on a single line.
While he says from Pelta, "he is disqualified from the outset to retrust Czech football," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the staff occupation in the commissions he would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his benefit, "Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pool
Jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Pitch pool in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a tour of the city or a hike, rest the tired legs in a whirlpool.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the last one and a half years, one of them could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artfully designed domes, they swam to the marble-pits, waiting for them at the edge of the pool, and surprised about acribally restored youth-style swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it in her notebook, with some interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been exploring architectural historians in this way - and now present them in her book "Bädüden": People's Swimming Hall in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she took her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much on her mind with sports, says Meder - it's different only in the water.
The only thing to be annoyed is that swimming fans with blue tiles and chillystone have to be found, while joggers can breathe in the depressing scent of sprout forests or listen to happy bird-wigs in the park.
"I was wondering one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the middle of Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Spitzer in the pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so large because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have made a lot of effort, swimming halls can be a real beauty: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture band "Bädüdten" provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis on 190 pages - but above all, it is a pleasure to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable copies in her research in Hungary.
In addition to a magnificent spa such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrates-containing water in an ancient Karstholle (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basin is filled with alkaline water and located in a flask-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the riding on the ski slopes.
The most exceptional swimming pool design is expected to be in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three open bowls it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Oetztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so much of heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and the shleen of which adheres to the skin as soon as you slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of the special art
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing areas: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sun bath in the Czech bathroom Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, it was in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed by this bathroom; it is possible to discover not only neoromaniac elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool-connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge so different style of construction into such a great unity," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a side thing.
Agrar Speculation
Deutsche Bank makes raw material business look through
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business of agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
The thing is clear to the federal citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions leave this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global raw materials exchange are driving the prices up - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, commodity laws were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the zockers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest to make profits.
In contrast to the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from Spiegel ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results are presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the Bank's top would like to tell us what its consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann bases on his image
Foodwatch-Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reckless banks today damage the general good."
As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly in the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all of its assets from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr Ackermann is about hungry people or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The view of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the head of the group wants to give a perfect picture of the office a few months before his departure.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors will not change to the Supervisory Board as planned.
With a turn away from the controversial agar speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shave - that would have to do with his successor.
Any second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore only 11 percent that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities where prices for food are charged.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: according to the survey, each second would cancel all the facilities in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and changing to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy ends: the Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won the 1958 awards, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and disguised.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When the modern post-war architecture is blackened by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition is an accurate and famous example.
At that time, Schwanzer's Pavillon got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a school-like branch building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden, the pavilion was designed as a temporary exhibition building at the Vienna Südbahnhof, and in 1962 it opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20 house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new house.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krishanitz has remodeled the pavilion, now called "21 House" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a case of luck in every respect.
In 2007, Agnes Hussein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, a student of art historians with a significant career, among other things, in the youth as an ice-skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion among politicians and monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the Foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should exist, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation, Krishanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had changed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensibly and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was for him a "very important place" where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost generosity and ease in its transfer to Vienna and its reuse.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy schleuder," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass-reinforced insulating glass used and the glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a lowered light grave between the house and the street provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-protection colour.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with a small budget.
"Often it was necessary to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office," says Krishanitz and points to a rugged ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krishanitz recently said, a typical drop-in-the-city story.
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to raise a real consciousness."
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building lucky fall: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main station quarters," with office and residential houses are created.
And another lucky case may come up: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krishanitz construction, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourhood in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The train has launched a crisis plan to prevent train failure in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report, is spending more than 70 million euros in addition this year.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, calling for a group-internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
The aim was to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in the event of extreme weather.
It was planned, among other things, to double the internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railway installations and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim was to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours, up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary steps.
Two months ago, after a high-level meeting with government and industry, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the rail in passenger transport had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the US
After the tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann comes new unease from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is still catching up on its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA is accusing a whole series of large banks of having led the cooperative banks to buy the financial products with false promises and would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and the banks were in the deep.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two monetary houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Cooperative Banks and is in charge of pleading to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting million-dollar damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind
The regulator also had other large banks preoccupied and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the US real estate bubble broke in 2007, this became a clash for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the climax of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers relocated.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have increased the number of actions to obtain redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest challenge.
It accused 18 international large banks of overtaking the two state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a complaint from FHFA, which is about several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses," without, however, giving a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as untenable and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett gets in with IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he does not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is not possible to predict.
However, he has now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was mainly providing services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knights' strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IT primary rock IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett now revealed in the US business station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus increased to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided for proper profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been relying on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for a long time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had lost technology companies up to now.
He says he only invest in companies, whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett used a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway, along with some 80 own subsidiaries, also has shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rek.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unspeakable sense of money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
Once the Buffett investment was known, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zell," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology," which is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small business operator in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a long-believed ghost returns: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
However, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" said the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, the co-operation was staged - as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media is like an earring: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which reports the background to the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this spiritual connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The action of the police and their later success in the search are discussed very critically in German Internet forums.
Why the German authorities did not think much more about looking for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some people, at least rhetorically, are ready to use drastic means: "If there is still a clamp here, there is nothing left to migrants but self-defense and arms."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The quality of the education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen."
What it means is, when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made it clear.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
No other event showed the Turks living here clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly caused by the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent an assistance telegram to the Turkish President, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many charges the Turkish people paid.
As if the value of a person calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been.
In addition to the efforts to provide a comprehensive information and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The scandal bank of the Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been slipping from one crisis to the next.
Now it's a German to judge.
I'm sure that's not what Axel Weber was thinking.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its new solidity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had circumvented all the bank's security systems and had recovered around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been considered to be a hit since then - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to advise the Bank from February 2012.
And he already takes over the board of directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's getting hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and a central banker, and would certainly have needed a time to be involved.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank."
For the UBS, on the one hand, is huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will save the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also a paid-out Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to be a very large number in investment banking.
The UBS 2007, on the one hand, managed more money-generating customers than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had moved into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I always put the UBS in my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it became apparent that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, head of the board, Peter Wuffli, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, it was known why he had left.
The bank's investment party had been involved with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For that it actually found investors, but which, from some to a short time ago, would still have been fighting the nose: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so hidden that you didn't even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, President Marcel Ospiel of the Board of Directors, and in 2006 the second best paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
The disaster followed in October 2008: the UBS, in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis, was before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-to-walk loan, which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We could not save the UBS again," says Bankforscher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second one.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and expressed its willingness to issue the data of customers who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty.
In this way, the UBS were more or less open to having helped in the tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just when it got a little more quiet, just as you thought the UBS would get it back, there follows this unlucky dealer story: a single dealer will make up EUR 1.7 billion before the bank finds out that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that the risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the bank institution of the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was the very idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had started to become guardians of the great assets of the world a long time ago: no too great risks, for which security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic was allowed to break down the world.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprügli for particularly noble chocolate.
The central office of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its head office on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elitist private banks such as Julius Bear.
The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy turning door.
The walls are marble-dressed, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or tell us how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all the Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he found - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes would have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the fishing axes."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008 the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the biggest rescue in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Häsig in his book "The UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the large bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How did that happen?
If you speak to Swiss bankers, you see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was too big for small Switzerland in the merger - and was growing ever more.
In doing so, the two different precursor banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers came to a lot of money, with which they could make a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospiel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospiel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, the feeble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospiel, the abdominal human being, who has worked from the bank's teaching to the top."
But Ospiel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear that the case was about to be overtaken.
The UBS staff clearly remember the management meetings, on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already taken some steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the top.
However, business consultants who were asked to do so highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income," there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that it almost cost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund created before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and passed securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
Post at the UBS became a sling seat and are still wobble.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has come to a close with all the business models.
Bankforscher Geiger already has an idea: end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink, so much is clear now.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has made his point: he is to run the UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
He's got 3500 jobs.
That won't do it.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself.
In public, he only says that he and his wife are going to find an apartment in Zurich for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is a burden on the US stock market
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without any impact.
The throttle industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales tickets.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values was recorded for the trade with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer was between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S & P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax, with a minus of 1.2 percent, was adopted by 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro-countries has significantly reduced its production and is in line with the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
The US investors were sceptical: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment-telling Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
In his view, it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the heap and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and had it first recorded against the trend in the trade process just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
According to his own information, Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's shares declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house has almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and is committed to $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institution's main aim is to increase its capital ratio and thus to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus reduced the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-range machines of type 777 and estimated the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed the owner.
719 values increased, 2281 declined and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, at sales of 1.38 billion shares 630 in the Plus, 1913 in the Minus and 82 closed unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seeds are considered to be "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
Some of them like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many communities there are problems of living on the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crow can no longer be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
The problems of nature protection in cities also led to the land-escape of the particularly protected seeds: the chemical use in agriculture has increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing construction and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of brooding, among others in the West-falian Soest, in the North-West, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crow in the district had provided negative headlines.
Critics had called the catch of the animals in bird traps and the killing of the animals with the legs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the burial, is not a good thing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Sprinkle nests with water or fall trees, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Gravity is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is possible to think of a combination of the animals' bursts from sensitive residential areas and relaxation facilities to relocate them in other places.
"Infoplates instead of chainsaws," however, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgen called for a completely different approach to the animals: "After all, we can best stand a pimple in the face by ourselves."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgen had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, which provided information on the life of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgen had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to get to a delicious bite, but also make their own tools as a tool.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested four seeds, the extent to which the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they have to bring a scaffolding to the collapse in order to get to a moth larva.
Without a lot of training, they realized the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the puffy crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wire pieces.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then applied the bucket to the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds were able to do so at first.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup were not met.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Following the double-successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row perfect after the 0: 0.
In the play-off-back with the outsider Montenegro a 1: 0 (0: 0) was enough for the Czechs, after the replay (2: 0) had already been a clear thing.
There was no more burning in Croatia at the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted commercial meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a measure of the start.
Ronaldo had a 30-metre free blow to the meshes for the early guided tour.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-range qualities and met from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnian who did not take place in the first half of the hour had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburg from the English table leader Manchester City put a head ball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
After that, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian prison room, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial commercial fmeter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely turned.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time the European champion of 1976 has been in a row to the EM.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of terror in the early phase.
The closing man Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic was just passing by the gate of Cech in the turn of the border.
After the break, the cross-latte had to save the already beaten world-class player of the Czechs, again the storm of FC Seoul had taken off (50.).
The gate just before the end made it all clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond a 0-0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink has to get his place on the bank of the World Cup third in 2002, the Croats are allowed to enjoy their fourth participation in an EM final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, and the attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the imprint in the gate.
However, after the second of terror, Croatia was increasingly in control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which took place from the 62nd minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the lead, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar to the guests.
From the beginning, Ireland pushed at the pace, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian rear team prevented the possible lead.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident, he was in the position to push the ball to the 1-0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, will invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ employees accordingly," announced Co-Chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Wallvillages had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55 000 employees worldwide, is running just as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by a comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horrors. A history of the First World War, told in nineteen fates," begins with a long list of main persons that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to do this: carefully cut this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic story, and these main characters will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and are deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe incorrectly as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"beauty and horrors" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance and office staff.
Some of these people are becoming heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flicks up like the votive candles in a church, some come along while others are dying.

It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Horrors" walks with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book are beehives, a Christmas party among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefly are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war is flooding the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, which smells like Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children, and has a gun fire in the distance.
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being conducted at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "were raised with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horrors" follows individual people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports can be frightening or irritating, but they are extremely alive in the environment of the collection of small moments that are lost in details.
Many of them are of lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere Replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false eraser rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
It describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in jam fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes sown with wood."
There was, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all that was meant for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and pretend to be such a facade of civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind your own strengthened and slapped shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he will probably die and will not take any note of it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beestiarium of the still young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced mass killers in the suit that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseeable way and there are just as frivolous behaviour as Heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococci-eiter, because soldiers bought and peed on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like that," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, they put him in the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet inexhaustible and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified than Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.

His book has the most glorious end that I have ever read in a book of facts.
I'm not giving it to you anymore.
But it's like with his book he took this side with the main characters in front of us and lit us with a match.
After an early failure a minutiously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them were involved in the operation.
It was decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which is contrary to the rules of the decree and which gave the house owners a huge increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how the occupation was carried out in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who was familiar with the orders, what a decree said as "exercise."
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then went back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Civil servants from various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including, among other things, the command of operations from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in highly criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1: 00 in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park is in the park," he said.
An ambulance with Jupiter lamps and speakers was ready for the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that were drifting from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light-blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their things and left the place.
The police said that by 1: 45, no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their goods and their goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the area to intervene, should be arrested in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the president of the police, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that a TV car on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
When the police moved to the west by the great mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their staff of city cleaning, which had been left behind, followed.
Some of the protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined together with their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officers were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3: 30.
The clearance was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "improper behaviour and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was there too.
Despite his presence, "Mr. Kelly" did not lead the operation, "as Mr Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway waited between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, Barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how the police from these locations extended the area around the Zuccotti Park.
One place was observed, like several officials, many of them with protective signs, people driving out.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the ripening of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The trade union of the carers will file an action against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last possibility that the trade union, Council of the District 37, is still open in their efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Sixty-six school workers, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst-paid employees in the city and had lost their work in a chess suit on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups to close the budget gap last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specified that the staff would be released from the aid.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference that will formally announce the submission of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be performed by Mr. Walcott and the City's Ministry of Education as a defendant and will count eight dismissed workers as applicants, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in charge of the lawsuit and therefore that its individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the city's arrondissement in order to support an action for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more help because they are under-financed chronically.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in the 23 district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 people in the 8 and 9 districts in the South Bronx were released.
By finding the loss of five out of eight school workers who were employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the claim says: "This is not a neighborhood of well-guarded parents who can organise donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for the extra financing of each school entry.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been released, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like the Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the authority of President John Kerry (Massachusetts), together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have started the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House were arguing about the choice of words of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide range of parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law failed in the Senate. In addition, the board agreed to a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was upset enough to criticise Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the foreign relations body or will they divide the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version is the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every parliamentary term of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or another area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to try to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlate's change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was presented to Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the change in the balance sheet in the Senate alone and another dozen that would control "federal expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients the opportunity to "write" such a measure, especially beginners in the Republicans who want to polish up their resume.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among the same sex is a recurring one, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the States reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move as much as in the past years.
In the 11th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last change to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Married but not defeated," said Gifford in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after a close-range armed man shot at her during an election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Giffford's (Arizona) Monday night appeared on national television. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that to return to Congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20 / 20," she ran for words and needed help on the way out.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the ball that shared its skull pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she was surprisingly returning to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake, triumphant.
In her first TV interview after the January assassination, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the 8 January assassination.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to.
Months later, Gifford is sitting in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to make simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Gifford whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see how the congressman, together with the therapists, sings to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Hanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin '."
In the interview with Sawyer, Gifford, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article on a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is being treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say," Gabby, you were not defeated, "said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings got up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't.
The very contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being overhauled with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were suffering in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support it is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops were fighting in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, talks are taking place about feeling sorry for the quiet and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence, as they defeated rebels and had travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over a high state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking if he was able to stand up to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after he returned from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely used as a praise.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno A.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely concentrated on the suffering of a service member.
Forces are recognised for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is faced with the growing pressure to get through hard in the event of rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in the event of a rape in the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit that they have brought against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be approved in court.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, the complaint was filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., including 17 plaintiffs, who, however, increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to identify, condemn or make available an appropriate case-law in accordance with the alleged attacks,
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, because the problem is starting there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them may be part of future actions.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs, so to speak, putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more actions to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted an application to reject the action.
The files of the court that are in place in Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy, in particular that the military cannot be charged with injuries caused by current or former soldiers in the armed forces.
Under the law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for any injuries to the soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage was caused during the applicant's military service," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams are increasingly playing important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
She does not stand alone in her fight; three more actions are pending except her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the alleged promotion of a anti-women atmosphere.
Independent of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to release them from service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed an action against the Veterans Administration (the "Administration of the War Veterans") in which it accused its discriminatory practices in its handling of claims for benefits for persons who have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to the Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of reference.
According to the Ministry of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3.158 sexual abuse was reported in 2010.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that come to it per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20% of the cases in the military were brought to justice, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people expressed as a character witness in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labor would work. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander," This was not his procedure. "
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so that she received no support.
Whether the lawsuit, which Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is a mere speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am a contemporary critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the lawyer of the applicants, will start with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amoclop in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups all over Europe and then they were targeting them with ads, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited users to a survey that asked for their education, attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office.
"It's a rather new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of extreme right-wing groups are usually young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes," text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who on average add three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and it would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook it all falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, has found that students who discussed their full-time exchange on Facebook are significantly more likely to drink problems than students who have been silent about this subject.
Moreno proposes that equal-level students, for example living consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (mainly using data that only Facebook has access to - digital freedom masters have long known that the site should make its large data base available to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site is watching them whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to provide your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood up to two amocles in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the laws, but I do not commit guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a prewritten speech, the permission to turn to the family of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was behind lock and bar.
They all participated in the goal that everything would go to a lockout.
"I thought he was cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does it automatically facilitate the sorrow and the confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dedusted this week before special film shows in the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribarian organizer who was eager to work on diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fashists" about the start of the personal computer. And he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since jobs were pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in facsimile, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after job death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, jobs seem surprisingly eager to explain their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh his thoughts and seek accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems to be impatient in responding to Cringley's questions and pushing him to respond more quickly to issues or side-effects of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone is recorded, the lost interview seems to be kind of scary, when jobs are evaluated, what other companies are doing right or wrong and its own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read post-hummy ratings of career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer, who is on the leap to greatness, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"All the years in business, I always ask," Why do you do things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's how it's done. "
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks in depth about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize Apple's accounting.
Distorted by how costs were recorded - most of the time it started with "standard costs," which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the very least.
How the Pope was anointed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while they are running as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you grilled on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs, gagging.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night through Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so good at retracing Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovation:
In the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some of the plates, he was asked by a customer to build the whole computer together.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on in Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a perplexing argument... you yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that fail:
Long before he had Apple resurrected, jobs previewed the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions went into stumbling and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your fins.
You have to make voices, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it goes to taste, it goes to try to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they'd be doing great things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically sharing question of whether to listen to President Obama's health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit against the far-reaching reform of the health sector, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law that became the headline of the conservative activists all over the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1 / 2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and will claim that the law is to be tilted will probably be Paul Clement, once a general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative principles of law.
Another company that is sponsoring the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who are challenging the law.
Another sponsor was the Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical giant, who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
The service was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican group in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that is not against moral rules.
Indeed, judges are free from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may take part in the benefit events of the law near and other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the cases related firms and to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the opposition to the code is punishing the actions of some judges, the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and danced during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a donation for this event undermine any claim for impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would mix court matter too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And the Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first legal proceedings came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case because she was too committed to defending the law to be unprejudiced.
Kagan does not do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars on land
The airline Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
On the weekend, Boeing announced its largest order for commercial aircraft of all time, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, the airline has an option to buy 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and the comfort of the passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually harmful to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boein's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in control, which is attacking the predominant position with the A350.
Boein's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed, which is directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President Loses Apparently Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the race around the government post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the race around the government posts in the Western State from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls... you've occupied electoral cabins, built street blocks... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, which had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to place three, a serious defeat for the split and happy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home country and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates got out of the local elections because of fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think this victory will make us look brave to the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that "unpassionate" are looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then it can do it by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is a source of concern that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies should meet to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide greater negotiating power for the European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to the 1.2 billion people in India, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less a day are living.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, the managing director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid public service employees, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of grading" due to the imminent risk from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to draw up "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant return on capital from their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible incisions in the defence sector
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heeded to the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, and thus triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if Congress cannot get a degree in spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unthought-out way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability to reach the target."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were finally hit the fighting forces, "said Panetta.
"While the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would have a negative impact on the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to war-time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the seizure of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a compromise in the budget or will increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a darker picture of what could be coming - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without a sailor."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-weapon squadron without a sufficiently trained pilot."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficient trained soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks moral and alert and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta mentioned new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and intervention capacity, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects of the removal could be the victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground-floor amphibian that Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and tests of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible risks can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to uncover a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is in charge of the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides deny each other.
The direction of Penn State is accused of perjury, as it is said that reports have been withheld that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy said to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he put in circulation denies which were quickly repudiated by indisputable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in campaign financing that are related to the cover-up of an out-of-marriage affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton caused when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship.
Stories about cheating in school and in college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the test answers so that they themselves were good at their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "uncover lies" is one that is important for every human being, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as charades, in which it is the goal to call "Have You!," the uncovering of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, in particular in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were exposed to the lie.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, they steal, they rot and they don't always fade.
However, it should not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine expressions of the face, about question and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of uncover, and it is clear that the uncovering of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiations or administration are one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, their interest and their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented" to others - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by watching the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining," the original position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the quality of the voice of your test person.
You should know better when someone usually trippin 'with the foot all the time, so that they don't wrongly accuse him of trippin' with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to the accumulation of remarkable verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
Consider these amuses as alarm bells that are screaming, not as evidence of uncloaking.
People who fool may stare when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment call," this deep, relaxing exhale and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
The question often signals falsely that an recruitment call is over just to look after this relaxation after the recruitment call.
You should also be aware of the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip-out is famous when he used the past form, when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Females can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than material, which often makes the alarm bells sound.
There is no magic to uncover lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to uncover them.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become the victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
The controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which made the trade unions angry and at the same time calmed down the environment, the pipeline-building company is trying to replan the project so that it can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline was finally approved, though with a different course.
This was the case after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was checked, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
They hate the environment, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogalala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of forcing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a magic attack that would have caused her little daughter to be so afraid that she would have surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten girl, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk took his luggage and Genevieve to the lobby in her building on the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone:" You should not drop your daughter off near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. "
She got angry and started to scam - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to put water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not reply to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The claim is for a non-specific compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge a fee and the family will plan to donate the money they get to child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten girl who has an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate transitions were a brake on the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloa will be remembered. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who referred to himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is the government. However, due to the climatic rigidities, growth cannot be said to be the case, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February did not only cause losses in the level of millions in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16%, which has a brake effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The fall in economic activity to November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March, 55 053 people in Sinaloa had no employment, which is 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to 6.19%, which resulted in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year dates back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the cuts in funds by the legislation that was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who are prohibitively raising dollars to make them work for themselves, to invest it or to use it for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, due to the problems of entry and, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which is what makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of the people working in the country who do not pay in the social security funds.
In the case of unemployment and undeclared work, low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Care in Mexico), come.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and the growing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, which represents a gap of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development), for its part, has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 million pesos at the National Congress in July to reinvest the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
The first year of the government, Mario López Valdé, made it clear to the representatives of entrepreneurship that the government was incompetent.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It is necessary to work hard to regain the terrain lost this year and we must double our efforts in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-agreed government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slow down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (the Mexican Association of Entrepreneurs) in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to encourage the state to have more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would lead the government's efforts to better track.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that a lot of work is still ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A population of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily sentences for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the trade possession of marijuana.
According to Act AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road against guard item No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed for lack of resources or only with a great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban authority for social development said that, although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it has to pay for the three programmes that exceed 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25% fell to the state. Up to now only the Federación and the municipality had contributed resources to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction was expected.
"They must contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign.
"We had already done so in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the resources that the State had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to speed up the administrative work and to pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of the analogue to digital signals in recent years has been one of the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which required the transfer of analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to combat the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the bill of law with the details of the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus the law remains in force.
The project for the action, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the law unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the law would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the law reserved.
The project was supported by only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives filed constitutional complaints against the law. After the actions were adopted, Minister Sánchez Cordero did not apply the law and stopped all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action submitted by the Chamber of Representatives, without entering into the debate on the project for which the Minister, Sánchez Cordero, was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if we do that, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also reminded us that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector.
The replacement of the analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radio-electrical spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest which had not only technical aspects, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "made the whole system's action necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of the Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be respected, "she assured.
The possibility to count out the ballot cards in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballot cards is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de resultados Electorales Prereliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governors' elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángelees Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that, just last 9 November, the electoral office had adopted a number of rules on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law, or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the prosecutor's office within the time limits provided for it, with the argument to have neither objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and considered the state representative's vote on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal," as he did not have the right to "decide or veto it."
María de los Ángelees Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of the individual counting of votes, stated that the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM now had the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the voting cards in part or in full.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part. The results in the protocols do not agree; the minutes on the census and calculation of votes are not in fact available or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total number of the full-filled ballot cards may be taken when there is a difference between the expected winner and the second-place winner, equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition president, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The number of votes may also be taken as a whole if, after the completion of the regular calculation, it is established that the difference between the expected winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages that have been subjected to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rarely relegated this Sunday evening to Saltillo, his place of birth. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Colonel's key was that his ashes were scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The most closest people to the colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the Colonel's key landed on the funeral hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Technology Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio was a member during his preparation for the school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant-in-Chief had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he has stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the air force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even be slippery on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminded him of him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: to fly a plane.
A final farewell
The Chief Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all due respect under the direction of the Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the technological education institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and found him excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he had fled, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority also crashed.
At 6: 05 p.m. the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over on the front of the barracks by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by the Major Jaime Martinez, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members introduced 11 people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organised crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a venom shot in an abandoned Finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at a point of 1.5 km of the country road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transitions saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up in the open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people inside about three meters further, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants without shoes; next to him was another with a white top.
The body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants was located just one meter away.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridge pods were found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for State Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor who were part of a criminal course that was mainly active in the village of Cadereyta, associated with abductions, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested and a prisoner was released in the Los Alvero settlement on November 11.
Three real estate and a cell phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas."
On November 12 at 6: 00 p.m., the military found a car without a number plate with two occupants on their watch round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2: 00 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are being harassed in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday education of the new Italian government
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set off," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard package of savings that was called on by the European politicians to regain the confidence that has been expressed in Italy.
The pressure for a hurry on Monti was further increased by the fluctuating market situation, which imposed a 7% interest on Italian government bonds for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue aid.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association, Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every effort."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
The success of Montis was significantly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats, which is making up Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay of the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, is also exerting pressure.
On Monday, Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The meeting is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath towards the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi was going to resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of €1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU rescue aid.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the forecasts that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, 10 have over 50 international games on the bumper.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 invited 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly game that is taking place today at 3: 05 in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selection games, the three-colour team only has the defence player Michael Umana, the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrelas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and Cup championships) as well as high-level European acupes such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated play-out at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico football players, on the other hand, have a few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see the Spanish team draw their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a level with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will be a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, a player of the Barcelona football club, has 106 members.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Ineesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and near Michael Umana the left side storm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five to over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
There are less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bass player Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty years of existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will be in the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costarican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to take our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely complete. They experience the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry for taking so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we've done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't sit down.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision that we will play will not be easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played for a long time into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might become forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's for the audience.
With this tour you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We also continue to focus on this blessing and like to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to take an active part in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with all of them and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we are also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened, which give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One person trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you feel about a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to miss this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, that reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what they have created without being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never published a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, in particular Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose to open it?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band we liked best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He's singing it, and I think he's singing the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
Of so many +
One of the first to come to my mind is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassist I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word "grunge."
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great, because it's worth listening to these music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could be a little bit easy to do, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is in prison for the violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and loss of muscle in the lower body parts.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish that because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems in the legs, were included by the doctor.
Since September 2007, Fujimori has been in the detention centre of Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan President, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the President of the South American country announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for the support of Calderón in terms of the incident with France, when the French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and sent a question to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been in the chair of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double assessment with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which include countries that have not introduced all the international standards for tax cooperation.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place at the business level since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the clays of the evil bowler, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month on the world's load signs was cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Ninth 3DS, with which it can be played three-dimensional without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain in the performance of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was the first video game by Nintendo, which was developed for this console from the very beginning, "because so far, success articles such as" Star Fox 64 3D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D "were already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less-crafted users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being the victim of the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play three-dimensional.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo inspires the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: the cordless installer must overcome with the dangers of spying platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player comes up with news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of US $70 million.
The trial on the US's request for the extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his government and that he had accepted all the extradition requests that he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The process of Colombia is a government act that takes place when all the judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when his legal situation has been clarified in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the suppression of 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organisation have led to important results: in this quarter of the century, 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday at the former Fabra i Coats factory, where more than 300 people took part.
In 1986, Trinijove was set up in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems that were at risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many people in charge of institutions and institutions who worked with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions at the time of the election campaign was the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, took part in the celebrations of the former socialist education ministers Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and the current left-green town council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Fund of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is not new to the association and the work he does," he said.
Occupied house in which huge parties were held was cleared
The owners of the house had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
All points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No 51 on the street Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people left the building, which they had been illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had led the neighborhood to despair, on a voluntary basis yesterday afternoon.
After the opening, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house administrator confirmed.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and led the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure centre had been indicated by the neighbors because of a lack of rest, while according to their statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the house occupancy, and in particular from the guests of the parties that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, became more and more in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque said that the harassment was so big that it agreed with the owner of the building that it would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that in recent weeks it has received more complaints from the neighbours.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked for the building to be cleared up immediately last week and for the problems of civil coexistence and the fall of the district to be taken into account.
He said that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the house occupancy had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, there had even been theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the anti-social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m. the police approached the road Montral No 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban call for proposals on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the now missing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its disapproval of the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, it was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibär.
This was the time when the city issued a huge invitation in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning to put gates in the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurrente theme, which two members of this old box, which meet in the elevator, can use.
And that is exactly the fact that the material offers for one of the rare connotations between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call is appropriate.
For Roldán it is "necessary" to talk after the attack on the coast about the "front on the mountain" to the extent that the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been carried out on the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he's well accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" Tore of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": one cannot imagine it as" access to a park, but as a definition of areas where trade is required. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge," which contains "some dangers."
The danger of the "uncertainty that the design of a public area today entails" in the light of the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the forum had their "swan song."
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be built.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step," that is, exceeding it.
"It is necessary to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [taking into account the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is more closely in line with the question, simply says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Valesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona," for purely topographic reasons.
Modol points out that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "touch deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its body the opportunity to "participate in this project from the very first moment."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of guidance, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing to do," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as the terms of the invitation to tender lack a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-section competitions have been written," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area looks at in its entirety."
This has at least led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, it is essential that the city guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and the green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of the Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that was led against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of the Casino Red has given him up before the Second Criminal Court of the district, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which is likely to force him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the competition.
After the prosecution, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Público had rejected the crimes of bribery and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he had probably bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security line, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the court proceedings as an occupant of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a warrant of arrest, which found that, after the almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to speak to Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Warehouse to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor's brother the penalty, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Minister Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had remedied the damage and which of the owner of the competition had given his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name.
According to the case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and no opposition to the trial can be filed in the following cases, and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the representative of the competition at 3: 50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he was acquitted and that his case would be put on the files.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details of the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its whole unbroken structure, was directly hit against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found in the search at other places, the impact on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a range of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidential had flown at a speed of travel and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the Head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State some deep hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
The impact site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match. There may not have been a loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to the present time indicates that the helicopter was hit from a straight and a side direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter was hit on the ground with its undamaged structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the accident site do not indicate either fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site studies, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is slippery and has a gradient of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minor search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unbroken aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She has a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry Focus) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers, was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8: 00.
He stressed that the study began at the Cuauhtémoc sports square (in the west of the state of México) and has been continued on the sports square of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 research staff is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports course (in the south of the capital district) and completed by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factors of Mexican children and young people in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years should fill in food-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked about their physical activity and their family disease to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He also stated that on the above-mentioned Saturdays the test subjects (weight, size, waist size) were measured, their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels were determined, such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes in relation to obesity in the child age).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out in the light of the concern of the health care staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of fat-based boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. The overweight also increased dramatically," said the IMSS specialist.
He said that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (in) on average was 65% Indian-American, 30% European and 5% African origin, which was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he said that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy (calories) that we have received, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit for the study participants was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and notified to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the results of the measurements to the parents and propose to them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short ways.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugar and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, developed with polymers modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the street were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 sludges if the rainy time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the area of the valley of Mexico) was to break out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying-out and maintenance of the asphalt lay was adequate, the number of the sludges would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Schlaglöcher from a technical point of view," which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed the asphalt with polymers modified in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which however has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the road floor and thus avoid the occurrence of slums.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic numerical behaviour.
The numerical behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C as a liquid, at 120 ° C it is very tether-liquid and at 50 ° C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes on one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ's researcher noticed that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road surface, which consisted of six material layers, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, in asphalt, and then fortified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on to it and the forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the street.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer is designed, the so-called carrying layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to make friction.
The one that receives and distributes most of the forces, the carrying layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, especially the water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water enters the layer and it is difficult to get back out. This causes a softening of all the layers of the road surface and therefore the appearance of slums.
When a whipped bell is created, "he said," the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico's National Research System) said that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of slurry holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road load should always be in relation to the load of the vehicle and it should be ensured that, in order to avoid frequent slurry holes, this regulation is complied with.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be easily repaired without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th misstatement.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to be on the winning stage, to show a silver crown and the band that she is a new Miss Colombia.
With the result that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already has 14 mistitles and Melina has joined the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclamated mikes are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Aléra, 1989, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, France, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom.
The big question that many are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
For the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her the First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?" which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the question:
"I read a lot, I believe in the literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end, I think that the book that was the most marked for my childhood is' The Little Prince ', a rather deep-going book.
It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "passions."
A response that came up with little counter-love, first because of the concept of "civilising" and second because it had not specifically explained how each of the books she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what has to be done.
And for all people, please read a little "The Little Prince." It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred person who had all the coincidences and had received all the prizes in advance (the Oster gastronomy competition, the audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the Queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed in her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two elevators at the coronation party.
Although she was safe with both, she did not have the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate, who won most of the prizes during the competition, does not finally become Queen."
In addition, Valle was out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essential part of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury was set up, Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derrium and fibrosis, which she was noticed in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was, frankly, hardly noticeable for me, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her. "
Because of this prize, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true in the night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let it come to the benefit of the crown.
No matter whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina will start her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that will give her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A lophobopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the investigation unit of the CTI from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia), was: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a stand-by service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigation proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were.
In 2000 he settled over and after the completion of the necessary courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he flew from Palmira to Cauca in the helicopter.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was found with the most investigated, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because it was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
With a magnification, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of a trace
For a dactylobuy from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without an error rate that can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they're arrested, many criminals make false ID papers or they don't have any.
We'll take the fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in a theft he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had stood up with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several theft," he remembered.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or load murder suspects.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected of being a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle was consistent.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist said that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape will be used to take it.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, that's the criminal database, or to the staff station.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was the same as it was shown in the SCSI TV series.
Just like not all the gold that shines, it's not all you touch, it's a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "embassies" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the area was covered by the clearance order and moved its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called on the authorities of New York this Tuesday, when they tried again with a court order to enter the Manhad Square after they had been cleared in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators clashed in front of the Zuccotti square, to which they wanted to get access with a judicial order that allowed the "emperts" the new tents at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held to the exposition order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the answer of the "embassies" to the exposition of her tent camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent exposition of the place and approved the demonstrators of the tent.
In addition, the "embodies" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give any exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have found themselves at this point, where a secondment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation in the morning is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators, driven by the square, carried and distributed this judicial order with them. They even gave it to some police officers who guard the place, which led to "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some police had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from exiting members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had already used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, due to this judicial order, the new opening of the public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to reestablish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of the Zuccotti Square in the morning, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clear the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were "afraid of their quality of life."
"The dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is in fact interested in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesperson of the movement, who "accused the mayor of not respecting the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organising "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," a rescue swimmer in "Baywatch," a rabbit at "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will be performing in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will bring life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson - who also for the spread on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the womb that Jesus is to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator in the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show by Charlie Sheen, as a Jesuschild.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, who is not far from this controversy.
In one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American Kim Kardashian "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in the Second World War.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property to $300 000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of continuous cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on Keynsian incentives that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been awakened, in particular, by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of the Japanese BIP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "escape currencies" of the investors who fled the debt crisis of the euro area and the bummed forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that, like a gravestone, burden on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony were the result of their weak business results from July to September.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very upsetting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown more clear signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy revealed that the most significant economic potential would have been the brake.
For he fell by four tenths to the 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the maze that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days that were agreed on when he was appointed might be too short for its implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democricia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures and that he would not withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the law on civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not give up the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unblock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it was not to be blamed for its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors came back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, "although there is no final date.
The Greek button still has strings for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of micro-finance worldwide."
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday reminded us that Spain has developed to be the second donor of this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of human confidence."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations until 2015, and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, that is to say, below the" poverty line. "
Spain "continues to" work on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it performs this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit that will last until Thursday will "guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have seen many successes" and "face many challenges."
The micro-credit summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two basic objectives."
The Queen said that it was intended that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world is based on the path "initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which the Queen Sofia considers to be a "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financial instrument as a "admirable idealist who has committed herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen went to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed by the first World Summit in Washington one year later and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project was to her yesterday as the "head of the family" in Valladolid and as the "advocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging the present to take part in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical requirement" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to link development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez considered that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the developed countries should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to be affected by the crisis.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success," "marginalized" people, "who are always standing in front of closed doors" "hope," and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opened their gates, inspired by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but was established in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough for those who consider the government policy on the Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's presidential request, proposed by the Bureau, was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against and ten had abstained.
The standing ovation that lasted several minutes, which, due to its intervention periods, was first Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, was not in any doubt at all on the part of the three European-oriented finance ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor, like the application, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union with regard to the budget policy of the euro-zone countries, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals for applications adopted by Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
It is certainly very unlikely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however, is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country on the Governing Board of the ECB according to the weighting of each economy, which obviously would result in a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The chancellor, who was looking to calm the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe application is dedicated to the importance of the "German-French friendship" a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France to the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in case of disease reports represent?
After family allowances, UMP and government are now taking on the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be arriving in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family allowance and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has always been a recurring one since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to study the economy in a hard sample, but on the other hand it is not less of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker health reports.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government aims to introduce a fourth day of care before taking into account a report from private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the specific company's permission, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily "Les Echos," threatens to raise anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And those with a different measure would be more symbolic: to give the public officials an unremunerated day of care in the event of illness (so far there is no time limit for them, in contrast to the three days of care in the private sector).
While these questions are in the debate, the majority of the population is also reopening the issue of fraud, which is aimed at the abuse of labour.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be repaid if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday 13 November before the RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of disease reports seems to be a little disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than other people in Europe.
However, first of all, we are in favour of the national figures.
According to CNAM, in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid out.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of the Health Sector, daily payments in 2008 were 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount covered 46% of maternity leave and employment accidents and 54% of sickness leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And that means 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, only 14.5 days of disease were granted to the French compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A mean that covers certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 people interviewed in France did not take a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by the health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be able to work more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French, State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global discount rate (disease or otherwise) was oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of disease reports is a very small proportion of undeclared work.
In the case of fraud, only a weak margin is achieved.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systatic controls in cases of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers), under 1.5 million, found that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term reports that were implemented, i.e. in 37.050 cases, were "unjustified or too long."
In the case of systematically controlled cases of disease of more than 45 days duration, under 1.2 million 11% were "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a report.
A point that represents only a weak one compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to the UMP Member, Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraud of the latter.
Papados: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to stop its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding the fact that the one hundred days of the Union's government were not enough to do this.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Prime Minister in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurosummit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area was "at stake," as it added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by "9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, gave his consent to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but sent forward that his party would not be prepared to take additional measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's new democracy.
He had agreed to the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and the accompanying free death, such as an expert body.
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada shows
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-reducing treatment to provide the best painreducing agents, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually concerned to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet with dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, which are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the Canadians' majority desire to die at home, however, in the end, 68.6% of these in the hospital die.
From the whole country, the rate of death in Quebec is highest at 86%.
In the sensitive question of euthanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed no wish to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and associated suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts who have equally inspected all the countries whose approach euthanasia and accompanied suicide have legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to abuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of incompetent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are being encountered, especially in countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are not legalised, as was confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconferencing.
"Ethanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already expressed themselves in favour of the euthanasia, as they believe that it allowed people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not lead to the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As regards the people who have already experienced an accompanied suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of the means in patients, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report said.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the removal of the funds for which a legal refusal had been made should not be considered to be criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life withdrawal and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The body said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the means already used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the Committee calls for pain relief or life-end measures to be considered at least, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain, as well as the euthanasia, and they are based on the same procedures.
reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has, among other things, referred to the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme," as these do not set any limits to euthanasia practice in the final phase of the disease.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is life-tired and over 18 years old asks another person to help him in his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social activity of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she was entitled to as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reporting on the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denies a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria Bashar al-Assad, which, however, thanks to the support of Russia and which has a "conspiracy" against the country, was strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the current Arab Prime Minister, who called on President Bashar al-Assad to "lay down his authority in Syria," in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar were the interest of his country, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to satisfy them must go," he said in an appeal to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly ruining attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the activities of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In the face of the repression in Syria, the international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have made an ever-increasing contribution," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in the south of Syria have died, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSTH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the siege of the city of Homs in the "shooting and heavy bombings of Jobar."
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister, Walid al-Muallim, nevertheless, felt that the country "was driving towards the end of the crisis."
He has, by the way, strongly responded to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give in," he added under the adoration that "the conspiracy forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the regime's repression that he was encapsulated in his "paranoia."
An out-of-plan new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the outbreak of the crisis, in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow, yesterday, considered the Arab League's decision to be "incorrect" in order to protect itself from the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already called on Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had for his part been waiting for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of rapes, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets required their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, saying that it is "sure that the markets will show themselves dubious and understandable."
His appointment by the President was welcomed in the beginning by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, particularly after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office was to establish a staff consisting of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, it estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the Parliament's proof of confidence by Friday.
Since the start of his function, M. Monti has committed himself to working in every urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government, does not change."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans that have been adopted in these last months, has in particular requested new hardening measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of the" Italy, which will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth, cannot respect the deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of time" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of confidence" and a "other Italy," according to the Editorial authors.
The great unknown see the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will have to pay for EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-usable explosive capsule, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AEA and other documents issued by this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had reported its "serious concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to start a company in Kiev that produces "Nano diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who not only walked in this technology, but also, as a member of the State informed the Agency, his entire professional career had been essential to this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased or increased slightly over the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in the number of crimes committed against Jews, and a 14% increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 in a very weak way, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences by motivated crimes, the FBI says.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes growing again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible for the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, considering that this could be done with a better police attitude to the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the era of the fight for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or origin, and now also involve crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter is changing the platform and it's more and more like Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users in particular to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and another "name" make it easier to track the activities of other "twitterers," the Internet user, whose messages ("tweets") are being followed and who are following your messages.
This will enable you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, to subscribe to new posts, to prefer certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner indicated before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, with some esoterically appropriate wording (RT for the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person).
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets."
"This is useless, intrusive and is too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The function" activity "will help me track certain elements of my Flux-Twitter better," lautbarte @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The Austrian government of the large social-democratic / Christian-democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the top credit rating of Austria (AAA).
It was the S & D Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the end of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, much above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the level of debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen to AA + at a stroke, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion in additional interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Ministers.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the euro-zone Member States of 26 October: at that time, the Heads of State or Government would have called for the reduction of public deficits to be included by the end of 2012 and for a return to the public balance of accounts to be incorporated into the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government in this respect is similar to the "German model," since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states should have balanced budgets as well as the municipalities.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020 / 21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda is threatened with a new intervention on the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authority would intervene again in the currency markets if the yen were to continue to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," we will intervene as we did the last time, "said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of driving a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly increased over, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as "a" refuge value "in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had tripled the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese foreign exchange fire is detrimental to the export of the archipelago, as it reduces the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (north-east)," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this degeneration of the yen could already kill the weak recovery in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - has, for the first time this year, regained its tensile strength thanks to the springy export standards and consumption of the "pumped" households caused by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the creation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister for Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ has already launched "appropriate measures," so that it can be said that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its State bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) it had spent on various purchases of financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
Interest feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make returnees
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the participation of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to increase.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted a little more in negative terms this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10: 00 and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in Europe's capacity to continue to maintain the debt crisis, had closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and the trade is moving on limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency, which continues its bass on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
The European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars around 10 o'clock, so it was down by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it fell after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had granted an application which, in particular, provided for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain continue to be at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% in 10 years, and that of the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro-zone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections are held in the country.
The "spread" of interest between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new, historical high.
Expected growth of the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the base of the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most concerned about.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first summary of the whole euro area is expected at 11: 00, with the EU Commission warning against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to consider this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it analyses the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should have their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing for a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to fight against climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to name only a few countries, continue to follow their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States, for its part, decided to set up another unit in its park by reoperating the three-mile island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, reality is contrary to the discourse.
The Berlin election will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence, in particular on Russia, on the increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role in competitiveness and a stability of the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the large majority of French people are not willing to pay, as they show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to get out of the nuclear power, it would be the victim of a large proportion of these SMEs, and the EUR 6 billion per year in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would fall more and more.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to function for 60 years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one has to admit that there is no miracle in the production of electricity, nor is there a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are to be possessed by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it was without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was called up by reactor construction as well as unendable human failure.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that allows it to withstand such phenomena.
As it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant among the electrical technicians, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by giving them a free line to take the lead in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers to dominate a debate that also determinates the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France itself had said.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the public authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had announced on a case-by-case basis (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talent, a wall or a waiter from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country," from the left hand side, by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not accept the whole of the world's poverty."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by horden of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 from both the right and the left.
The two camps saw immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities that point to the possibility of partnership development to solve our "migration problems."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recent work, which summarises the latest information on immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Reducing immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local labour force, in particular the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than the local wage workers, as they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are not in the labour market.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers do not travel much, the more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not in line with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesists, this complementarity also leads to a positive effect of immigration on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the rate of immigration will lead to a related long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is acceptable (a high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, and in the European countries, on average, around 1% of the total household.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who emigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, make a net contribution to the public budget (revenue minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing intersections "with his teeth" to the start of his mandate.
However, these mentioned teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some would have believed it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the spirit.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient to do so and can be as well a "repressive instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind in the Greek true-false referendum would have been of a double intellect in this respect: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to press for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in a wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a jump in the emptiness of the nationalist retreat with his eyes attached: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, in full right, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is dedicated to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its failure and its lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations that it is associated with.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
It is up to the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free themselves from the markets and to create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without making us very sure that we will be destroyed.
After a long time of fighting over this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing for European economic governance.
I agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it would prefer to the citizens - would be a new folly and a further deadlock.
We must take on a new stage in European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford to do enough here.
This information shall remain valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic, politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contact-free" chip cards become the general property
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or the payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year before, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of the contactless payment, after it has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contact-free visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contact pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over bank cards to their customers in the future, which are equipped with contact-free chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of equipment has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to carry out these transactions.
"You're in a state of delay."
"But they should have a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow its customers to make contact without payment by phone.
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-awaited relations between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now obtained "certainty."
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations of the secret services point to clear cooperation," he said, without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January has encouraged the emergence of interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to have been killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the led phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian, who for a long time had been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but one must certainly wait for more clear evidence before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's conceivable."
"For years it has been known that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from the outside world and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mitigates.
In these last months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as well as the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the use of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to start with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, for a long time considered the group to be a community of illusions, which should not be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist faith of Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "Western education is a shame," follows the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-term region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It is political and demanding strict respect for the Sharia, while the activists associated with it are committed to the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in mind.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
The reaction of Abuja is, however, as usual, indexed.
The army is surrounded by the city, and 800 people are killed.
The prisoner of Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming more and more radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which demanded 80 lives, and then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is to be blamed for a suicide attempt that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind
In August, the United Nations local seat will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since been a concern for all the security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and was ready to give all the information. "
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivaling in simplicity and ignorance of China, Iraq and the support for Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-conspirators have repeatedly let their drenching statements and statements on foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
On China, Iran and Israel's aid - often in no way supported - are falling slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party," Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to look at the "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that has been the most attracted to Asia by the emigration of entire industries.
He said that if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, it would have been stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut the air off in terms of his flattering gesture of emotions.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being answered, as he is stagnating in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's Image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I was elected, I would stop Iran," he had made a sound.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-ranking candidate, is showing a shameful ignorance of the file.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be counteracted, as Beijing "tried to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to be the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for his part, is prepared to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists, which Obama banned in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is a long way from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a major foreign policy.
In contrast to the current presidential opponents, Reagan had also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this is not quite as unforced as it is.
The population estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has taken out Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting itself from military intervention that has led to a paralysis.
And Obama is more surprised by the fact that he argues that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership position.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with gloss and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly to each other under the sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday under an orchestra sound and at a gourmet buffet.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the control of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1.224 km length, which connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already make the possibility of building a third line sound on your own line.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous construction works like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close their access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not in favour of comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of the development of European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have a strong use of gas and whose gas reserves are at a disadvantage.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed in the opening of the gas pipeline by pointing out the degree to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, who are numerous in Lubmin, with regard to the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship's tankers.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, about 200 m deep.
In their construction, mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be eliminated.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, the spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers did not do so because the Sweden had little effort to see a Russian state-owned company settle in a permanent way at the level of their coasts.
"In the case of a Havarie we close the gas outlet in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline will therefore soak into the air.
However, this case is considered to be very unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot that is controlled for external observation purposes from a sea ship and by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement by the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal on its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), are also included.
These five companies have formed a company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on an extended 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the really transported gas quantity is," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was covered by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas exit path.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin, a brand's notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskin now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlelight with writing spent hours.
The notebook of Moleskin is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-coloured sides, as it has aged over time.
However, the Moleskin notebook, as you know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to put a dedicated design notebook on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's expert consultant at the time, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which refers to a cotton lacquer, which is for example used for upholstered benches.
This kind of notebook was very much asked among writers and travellers.
"Moleskin has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand leader at Modo Modo.
The success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and were established with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook also attracts business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskin has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is able to enforce its identity.
"We followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the growth of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskin: the brand recently launched an exposure called "Detour (detour)," in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a band of leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskin benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendar, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that Neider is planning: In the autumn of 2006, Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Synchita Capital, and thus created a new chapter in the company's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled people remain so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Disgraceful?
"No, that's what Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, stresses," which is the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within 15 years is significant."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no qualifications and only 10,000 are disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% of the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and which are the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a company founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much for the physical brakes.
The unspoken remains, the spiritual attitudes, which, while certain, are slowly developing.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled" which is "over-represented" by persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minors. "
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of the disabled, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which come from 2008, point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefix, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of "fees paid" establishments has been reduced as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc said."
"But this improvement also reflects a real knowledge, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled persons, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday night (8: 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game.
It would have been too far-fetched to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attack player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had gained nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller, for his part, assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national 11, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday night against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally "shine."
But without leaving the note of "pleasure."
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, and he has led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably help to further strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We just got in the way."
"To play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made a sound of "pride."
"The pride to perform a galamatch."
"pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France "has become a team at a very high level again," a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a hell of a job," he said.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blue (the French National 11)... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians get out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France is included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, is looking forward to the rematch against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the time of the play, both teams had failed to make the difference.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao," his national 11, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the replay (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to push the thing on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an external door."
At home, however, in their bright-lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to make a move in front of an audience that is equally hot, even if the game was of course announced as "very close," said the optimistic but clear bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz was related.
The indecision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
An indecision can already be sufficient for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved an external gate," regrets Bento.
"We will fight against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnian people at the beginning to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
