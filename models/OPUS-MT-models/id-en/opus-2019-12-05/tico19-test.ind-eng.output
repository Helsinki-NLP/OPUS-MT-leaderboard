The cumulative incident of coravirus (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union / Economic Territory Europe and Britain, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) show similar trends in the European Union / Economic Territory and United Kingdom which confirm that, despite its different steps depending on the state, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italian, state, hospital and intensive care units, let's increase their readiness for the COVID-19 patient surges that will require health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown ethyology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this disease's causative agent was a new coronavirus called the Koronavirus. Heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus.
Evidence up until now suggests that about 80% of the covID-19 people have mild diseases, which is a mild respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, the COVID-19 developed into a heavier disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases were critical to need intensive care.
Morality of patients being hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we examine the trend of the cumulative CoVID-19 EU / EU (EU / EEA) incident and then compare it to the incident in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020.
Case CoVID-19 in EU / EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and covID-19 dynamics in other parts of the world today following Chinese pandemic dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In 2020 Eurosurveillance published March 5th, Spiteri et al reporting the first European with the COVID-19 case confirmed by the definition of the WHO case.
In EU / EEA, the first three cases were confirmed by France on January 24, 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, the case of COVID-19 has been detected in all 30 EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020, including, there are 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and the cumulative incident case COVID-19
At the European Disease Control and Control Center, the number of cases of COVID-19 that every country around the world is updated every day at 8: 00 am, obtained only from official sources such as the State Health Ministry, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess the COVID-19 trends at EU / EEA and UK, and compare them to the Italian trends.
As the prevalence of the COVID-19 case is active, we calculate the 14-day cumulative incident, so account for the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU / EEA and UK, in the period of 1st January-15th March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases told by each country up until March 15, 2020 at 8: 00 p.m. compared to the case of Italy during the period of January 31-15March 2020.
Tren CoVID-19 in EU / EEA and UK
The 14-day cumulative incident of the COVID-19 case in EU / EEA and UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (Image 1).
For EU / EEA and UK overall, the cumulative CoVID-19 incident began to rise around February 21, then increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
The trends are mainly driven by rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU / EEA countries and the UK indicate a trend in similar COVID-19 cumulative incidents.
Image 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU / EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period of 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, until March 15th at 8: 00, 15 other EU / EEA countries and UK have reported the total number of cases worth the amount of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of the COVID-19 was told to rise rapidly in EU / EEA and UK.
The unobserved trends of the covID-19 cumulative incident suggest that the pandemic is increasing at an equal rate in all countries.
It's regardless of the different stages of the state, the variation of the public health response, and the possibility of the case definition between the state and the different protocols to select patients that should be tested for a COVID-19 confirmation, which includes next-term testing.
In early March 2020, affected Italian doctors explained the situation about 10% of the COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reporting that hospitals and intensive care units in this region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, case access data for COVID-19 in hospitals and / or intensive care units at EU / EAA levels are only available for 6% and 1% cases.
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complete the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and death rates.
The study done in 2010-2011 shows a huge variation in terms of intensive treatment and madya care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more resources or less than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and madya care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modelling scenario related to the saturation of health care capacity, with the estimated prevalence of the COVID-19 case of treatment for each EU / EEA and UK countries associated with the risk > 90% beyond the capacity of intensive care bed, provided at the update of the six rapid ECDC risk assessments of COVID-19.
Because so far, the most classified cases in the state of EU / EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of regional service coverage, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the state-of-the-art level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and trends today in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in EU / EEA and UK.
Therefore, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 in need of health care, especially intensive care, as it happens in affected areas in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, comprehensive approach to understanding, accepting, and adjusting response to the immediate approach to the mitigation, because the increase of cases is fast, as anticipated, may not give the decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, and apply the proper response if it is not applied.
These rapid risk assessments also include public health measures to stimulate pandemic impacts.
The window is available for a short window of opportunity when the state has the possibility of increasing its bending efforts in slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU / EEA health care system will likely be facing a spike of patients that require intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease, caused by coronavirus breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, which has caused human disaster.
Similar to the homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the bats and causing similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower severity and morality than SARS, but more contagious and more elderly than younger people, as well as more men than women.
As a response to the amount of publication that's rising rapidly about this new disease, it's trying to give a quick and comprehensive review of the subject of research that's growing rapidly.
We're going to go through epidemiology, ethniology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While there are many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps understand and eradication of this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25th, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks later by a new viral outbreak.
The virus was very homologous with coronavirus, which led to severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; so it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has led to 80,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with over 40,000 patients sent home and 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and potentially destructive more powerful than terrorism.
According to Publices (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / published /), in less than two months since the first reports on January 7th, 2020 which set the sequens of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which include virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review is trying to summarize research advances in this advanced new subject field.
As much as possible, we're going to try to compare CoVID-19 to SARS and the disease caused by other CoV, which is Central Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, the 2012).
We're also going to talk about things that have been learned so far about prevention and disease prognosis and some other unanswered questions, but urgent.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the cold 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found CoV, which is twice the plausible for humans, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which led to an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown at Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster with its first unknown origin was reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequences launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, an epidemic spread rapidly into the cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, a health care infection was reported, which suggests that human-to-human transmission might occur.
On January 23, the quarantine area was imposed in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transport was stopped.
On January 24th, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market were considered the initial location of an infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared this outbreak as a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, it had already spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2) .2).
Because the situation is growing very rapidly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still has to be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients, which include 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presenting the following updated epidemic images (https: / / mp.weixin..com / s / UlBi-HX _ RHPHP0112bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half of the infected people are over 50 years old, only a few under 20, and only 14 infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31 / 100,000) than women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 extends into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
The COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) a day from Agran to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from awanism to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3,51-4.05) and R0 is at 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of massive transportation before the Summer Festival in China.
Patient Morality with a confirmed case of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and a qualified morality for all patients by 3.06% (95%: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (60), and pneumonia is heavy.
Cov is a massive unified virus subcommunity that contains a single strand of RNA sense.
Cov can be divided into four genus, which is alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with the alphabet and beta-Cov known to infect humans.
Glicoprote bulge or spike (S) covers tied with its cell receptors, enzyme exchanger angionsin 2 (ACE 2) and set for peptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus's RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein cover and nuclear proteins form a vesicle containing virion, which then experiences fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic Sequens SARS-CoV-2 reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarities among 10 sequential samples; the sample is taken from the site of the plague, which is the Huanan Sea Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than it is with MARS-CoV.
Through the microscopy of the electron transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium of a very thin human airway.
Human affairs are found to be receptors for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 proteins bond with the human Ace2 are weaker than the SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-Cov-2 is causing infection that is not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with org3b and proteins secreted in the orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the patabolityness of the virus and the inhibilation of the IFNAMA expression; but, orf8 does not have a functional domain or a known motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reporting a complete human cryo-EM Ace2 structure at a 2.9 resolution in a complex with a transporter of amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is formed to form dimmer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind to two S proteins, which are evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 could be used as a therapeutic target in the drug supply to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and middleman
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans via ferret and camel.
Through a philosophical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with another CoV, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoV-SARS-SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVX45 and bat-SL-CoVX21.
However, the mediator who helped the virus cross the barrier of the species to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route must still be explained.
Ji, et al, proposed a snake as the carrier of the bat virus to humans that involves recombination homologous in the U.S. protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, propose that long-range mammal-mugging ants are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as intermediaries of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic homology on CoV which is found in the engols and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, 1% of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a huge difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Gbr 3).
SARS-CoV-2 physical properties are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 ° C and humidity 40% -50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It's been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; eter, ethanol 75%, the synergy containing chlorine, acidic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvent, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disabling the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
At this time, no detailed study has been reported on an immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other CoV research before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4) .4).
Generally speaking, after the invasion of the host, the virus was recognized by the default immune system through the pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces an expression of the inflammatory factor, the dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis interferon type I (IFN) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocyosis of antigen virus by macrophag.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Pretty soon, adaptive immune response joined the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4 + and CD8 + cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against the virus, and CD8 + T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
The helper T cells produce proinflamatory cytokines to help protect the cell.
Even so, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing an apoptosis T cell.
Humoral immunities, which include complements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, the antibody isolated from a recovering patient neutralizes the MMS-Cov.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system produces a huge amount of local free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case scenario, a massive organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked by an astern cluster, much more regarding the elderly with pollination and pregnant women.
Generally, people exposed to a large number of viruses or who are affected by their immune functions have a higher chance of infection than anyone else.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as described at the top, shows that the incubation period 4.8 (3.0-7.2) is based on demographic 8.866 cases.
It's important that health authorities adjust the time of quarantine effectively based on the most accurate incubation period that prevents the infected, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a symptom of the COVID-19 primary and early, with or without any other symptoms such as dry cough, asphyxiation, muscle pain, spleen, throat pain, rinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, naussea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dypnea and / or hypochsemia one week after the disease.
In heavy cases, the development of patients' diseases is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
The patient who has fever and / or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung imaging disorder, should be fed against the virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 shows that the percentage of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings have been reported in the two recent studies, which are the studies on family clasters and clasters caused by transmitters of asymptomatic people.
Compared to that, the demographic study in 2012 shows that the MERS-CoV patient also has a fever (98%), a dry cough (47%), and dispnea (55%) is the main symptom.
However, 80% of the patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS letality than the COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and sore throat (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dispnea (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) shown as a primary symptom and ventilation support required for about 14% -20% patient.
Up until February 14, the covID-19 morality was 2% with confirmed cases of 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS morality in November 2002 is 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, the morality of 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-COV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% trust interval of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-Cov only ranges 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MES-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortalities, and R0 given at Table 1.
The numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spreading ability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as common as MARS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Classmates are often found in one family or in a gathering or vehicle like a cruise ship.
The patient often has a history of travel or living in Wuhan or any other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the epidemic.
However, it is reported that a person can carry a virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that a patient being released from the hospital can carry a virus again, and it raises awareness to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients had a normal or decreasing count of white blood cells.
For example, lymphopenia by counting white blood cells < 4 × 109 / L, which includes lymphocytes < 1 × 109 / L, and aspartat levels of aminotransferase and viromia that are increased in 1,099 patient COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzyme levels and mioglobin are increasing in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood rates are increasing in most of the patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer levels increase, which are progressive fibrine-decomposition products, and the lymphocytes count.
Toracic photo abnormality was found in a large portion of the covID-19 patients and was marked with a bilateral cloud shadow or opacity of ground-glass in the lungs.
The patient is often suffering from exacerbated pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute breath syndrome.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly compounds the gas exchange disorder.
Pneumocyte dysfunction type I and type II lowered the surfacing rate and increased the surface pressure so that it lowered the lung ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings in thorax photos are often parallel to the worst rate of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first CoVID-19 pathological analysis showed the pneumocyte desumations, the formation of the hialin membrane, and the infiltration of the interstitial lymphocyte, as well as a core sysitial cell in the lungs of patients who died because of this disease, according to pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar pathological analysis of SARS patients and MERS.
Detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 through a countertryption polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as a primary criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to a false level of negative height, which could speed up an epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depends on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also happens in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination between the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is crucial and a necessity to create effective diagnostics.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protocol of using SHERLOCK-based CRISPR techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects fragments RNA SARS-2 synthetic at 20-18 moles / L to 200 × 10-18 moles / L (10-100 copies per cropper input) using a crumb stick in less than an hour without needing elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors are mainly offering support care to patient COVID-19, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MARS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current therapies and potential therapies with antivirus drugs, immunosupressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese traditional drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed to be used in therapy.
The pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 particularly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express Ace2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is crucial to relieve symptoms and saving lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical vents, depending on the severity of disease.
The patient with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane, which is a modified cardiopulmoner shortcut technique used for cardiac or respiratory treatment.
Moreover, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also very important to SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reaction resulting in cytokin storms in both SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokin storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the degnant release of a cytokin series, which includes TNFFLK, ILL-2, IL-6, IFNNY, IFNNY, IFNOKU, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of compound organs.
The immunosupression is crucial in the handling of cytokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immususions for cytokinous storms include the modulation of immune response directed by T cells; IFN-neg blocking, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibisi; blinatumomab; pressure signal cytokin 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are used a lot in SARS care to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for severe lung injuries on patients SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, steroids can result in severe side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which affect prognosis deeply.
Nevertheless, giving corticosteroid short on a low dose until it is being advised to provide with a cautious COVID-19 critical patient.
At the time of this review, no effective antivirus therapy was confirmed.
However, the intravenous purdesivir, which is a nucleotid analog, was found to work on a covID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later on, the remdesivir also shows an inhibitor to the other single-strand RNA virus, which includes MARS and SARS viruses.
According to this, Gilead provides this compound for China to perform a series of tests on infected SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Moreover, baricitinb, interferon-lube, lopinavir / ritonavir, and ribavirin has been advised as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomit, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir.
These therapeutic interactions with other drugs that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma from a recovering patient and making antibodies
There's a long history of blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from suffering from the disease.
Indeed, patients who have been cured often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin that produces a B lymphocyte to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects, recognizing unique molecules in pathogens, and instantly neutralizing them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by the decline of viral inflammation and the increased saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to file that method for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Further, in addition to the effects of his therapeutic effects, some of the flaws related to plasma have to be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is required in large quantities to treat critical patients.
The development and production of antibodies is specific enough quickly to fight a global epidemic that is difficult to do.
Therefore, more important and practically isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform an effective antibody suppression of proteins that are essential to viruses.
This way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect most depends on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it's difficult to extract or verify those components or the optimum combination.
Today, due to effective and specific therapies for the COVID-19 yet to exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms to medium or for people recovering from severe illnesses.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsule and Lian Hua Wen's capsule were found to be in charge of COVID-19 therapy.
Top recovery rate in patient therapy COVID-19 is observed in several Chinese provinces that use TCM at 87% of his patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, using TCM only at about 30% of the patient COVID-19, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this ratio is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the patient's number and severity, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends posted a study that compared western medicine therapies to WM (WM) combined therapies of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptoms loss, and residency is much shorter in WM + TCM groups than the WM group alone.
The more impressive thing is, the symptom hunting rate (from light to weight) is much lower for the WM + TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4%% instead of 46.2%) and the less morality in the WM + TCM group than the WM group (8.8% than 39%).
Despite that, the effectiveness and security of the TCM are still waiting for better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to sort out the working mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or the combination, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were very frightened of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the quarantined person also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects like insomnia caused by corticosteroid can lead to greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidity, which includes depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor fluctuations, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even susidality ever reported.
Tracking a history of contact and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to a CoVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and more guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patient COVID-19, the person suspected, and the person in contact with them, as well as the general public who needs it.
Psychological support must include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans and the use of tools and professional electronics to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to break off the transmission chain of the reservoir of animals and humans infected with vulnerable hosts and often complete antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the virus.
An attempt has been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which is long and effective in creating an antibody penetration and / or immunity protecting against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, the live-weakened vaccine has been evaluated on animal trials.
Nevertheless, the effecin vivo candidate of this vaccine in the elderly and model of letal challenges and its protection against the zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
It's probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the contrary, sporadic cases and MERS clasters continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other areas as they continue to have zoonotic sources in the region in ten.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS by using decommissioned viruses, plasmid DNA, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal trials.
The vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2 is safe and effective for non-immunes is a very urgent and important task of controlling an ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome because it's a long time to develop a dynamic vaccine (average 18 months) and a dynamic CoV variation.
As a new disease, the COVID-19 has just begun to show clinical travel to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can get better without a sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and morality in patients with heavy cases.
Therefore, the formation of the disease prognosis model is crucial to health care to prioritize its services, especially in a restricted area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with patient prognosis COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in studies containing 8,866 cases as described above.
The patient in need of intensive care tends to have a combination of pollination and complications as well as significantly older than the patient who doesn't need intensive care (median age over 51), which implies age as a prognostic factor for the end of COVID-19 patient.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 than 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Commorbidity and complications: patient CoVID-19 in need of intensive care has greater chance of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events are also the main reason for the death of a SARS patient.
SARS-CoV-2 reported it could also bond with the cholangiocyte with ACE2-positive, which could result in liver dysfunction on patient COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and disease that is based on is correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal lab findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and proposed as a prognostic factor potential for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and severity and CoVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, an increase in lactic dehydragenase (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and the heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: toracic photos and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
As said on top, steroids are a lot of immunosuppressants for infection to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Due to high corticosic doses of being used on severe SARS patients, many have survived the disease eventually suffering from avascular osteonecrososis with a lifetime's successful and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroids should be used on a low dose and short term on patient COVID-19.
As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered tremendous stress because they had to undergo extreme long-term quarantine and uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
The psychological counseling and long-term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, the COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological description than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or without symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to any other CoV that causes the cold.
Therefore, in the early stages or the incubation period, infected patients could produce huge amounts of virus during everyday activity, causing enormous difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was believed to occur when patients were seriously ill and most of them did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Today, a great effort is being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the continued quarantine of almost an entire population in the hope of breaking off the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this act is extremely destructive to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is dropping, which indicates an epidemic delay.
The most optimistic estimate states the outbreak will end in March and the drop phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et. Indicates that COVID-19, which seems much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et. Make a model to predict the end of the epidemic and state that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conka and the patient's throat which was healed and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier.
Even so, promising signs occur in China, if you look at the decline of a new number of cases, which suggests that the current strategy might work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases with half of death as well.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
Probably, similar to SARS-Cov, SARS-CoV-2 weakened its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that can't really coexist with humans.
The comparison of the CoVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through a cough or sneeze, and perhaps also through direct contact with a contaminated substance by the virus.
The virus was found also in the feses that brought up the possibility of a new transmission, which is a feses-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases earlier and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, a common precaution must be made to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or people who are infected.
The first defense line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirators (serial numbers 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgery masks keep the spray of potential infected people from getting airborne or sticking to the surface of materials, those sprays can be passed on to others.
However, only an N95 mask (serial number 1860) can protect against virion inhalation by size 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both of which is about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers in direct contact with patients should be wearing N95 (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, the health care provider must wear a suitable isolation cloak to further reduce contact with the virus.
A virus can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear invisible face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general community in affected or potentially impacted areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfected soap more often than usual, trying to stay home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potential infected people.
A three-foot distance is believed to be suitable to maintain distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, his high homologous with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7th, 2020, should be a great warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calms the population by saying that this new virus has a low proliferation and reproduction capacity limited from humans to humans and prevention and confirmation of disease is not a problem.
This message was very soothing to the fears of society, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, so that the critical time was missed for a small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The Chinese Disease Control Agency should learn a lesson from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be more careful (1) when making public announcements, because every word is taken care of by the residents and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive information than waiting for official reports from the doctor or the authorities; (3) is more limited to suppressing the potential of the epidemic at the beginning, and instead of trying to calm the public; and (4) is more likely to increase public awareness of the epidemic and test the response system of the periodic.
The CoVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to break out in late December 2019.
In less than two months, outbreaks have spread across China and over 50 countries in the world during this review writing.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the CoVID-19 outbreak suggests that the SARS outbreak is repeating itself.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to block the epidemic and handle patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than the young and more about the men than the women, and the mortality rate is also higher on the elderly than the young.
SARS Morality is higher than covID-19 morality (10.91% than 1.44%).
CoVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Asai RNA routine to check SARS-CoV-2 may have negative results on some of the COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a recovering patient can give more positive results to the virus inspection.
This finding has greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With the fast progress of the COVID-19 research, some important matters still have to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although found genetic homology at 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-SARS bats, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from the bat.
What animal becomes a mediator species to transmit the virus from the host, say bat, to the human being?
Without knowing answer to number 1 and 2, we cannot disconnect the transmission effectively and the plague can reappear at any moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry show that SARS-CoV-2 is bonding with ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the breathing cells and result in next pathological changes?
Does this virus also bond with cells that express Ace2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective care.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus develop genetically during the transmission between humans?
Is this pandemic going to be a worldwide pandemic, ending up like SARS, or doing periodically like the flu?
The answer to the above question and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, whatever the price is, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to return to normal life.
The origin of the human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the coevolution of corona virus and its host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs were known to cause mild diseases, such as selessing.
The disease of severe respiratory syndrome and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome turned things upside down and revealed how an HCoV infection can be very destructive and life-threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in China central at the end of 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and shocked us with a higher transmission, but with lower potigenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis, therefore understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most of HCoV comes from bats, in these animals, viruses aren't patrogenic.
The host of several HCoV intermediaries has also been compromised.
The host identification has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of cov-host interactions on animals can also give us an important insight into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of current knowledge of the seven HCoV, focused on its history of discovery and its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
The important thing is, we compare and interpret the HCoV from an evolutionary point of view and a recombination of the genome.
The epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) disease is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the terms of the successful transitional and evolutionary implications of the virus in the severity of disease are also highlighted.
The corona virus comes from the Coronavidae, which is a bunch of cloaked RNA viruses, positive senses, and a single chain.
It has the largest genome of size 26 to 32 kilobases between an RNA virus called "CoV," because its morphology looks like a crown under a microscope of electrons.
According to its structure, CoV has an unglimented genome that has similar settings.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading (ORF1a and ORF1b) overlapping.
Poliproteins experience further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome is comprised of open read (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bulge or spike (S), either sheath or envelope (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A specific amount of protein complement for certain lineage is also encoded by various CoV bloodlines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the CoV is classified into four genuses (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); between these four genus, the beta-Cov genus has the most HCoV and is divided into four bloodlines (A, B, C, and D).
Phiogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most genes of alpha-Cov and beta-CoV, while the poultry represents the main reservoir of gamma-Cov and delta-Cov.
For thousands of years, CoV has been constantly crossing the barrier of species and some CoV has become an important pathogen in humans.
Until recently, there were seven known human CoVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-Cov.
Another five beta-Cov covering HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, heavy-respiratory corona virus (SARS-COV), corona respiratory syndrome Middle East (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as the sniffles and / or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patagenic, causing a heavy low-breath infection at relative to more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute arDS disorder syndrome and manifestation beyond the pulmonary organs.
The first Strain HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the snot of a capable patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, the more knowledge is collected through a deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both causes its own healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive outbreaks in history today, which infects more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporsis spread across the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), the next one called SARS-CoV-2, is an epidemic agent of corona virus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken lives over 3.120 people and infected over 91,000 people up to March 3, 2020.
The alarm went off and the world had to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of all HCoV evolution of the bat in the bat, the CoV is well-funded and noncombinant, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised a huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenge for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origin of HCoV gives the framework to understand natural history, driving power, and the limitation factor of interspecies displacement.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search of animal hosts, mediators, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in future prevention.
In this review, we give you a general picture of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlighted and talked about the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually noncombinative in its natural reservoir, but it became a pacetic after the transmission of interspecies to the new host.
We've also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution that increased transmission abilities often accompanied by a decline in pataggenicity.
The final result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was also discussed in this context.
Cov animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the isolation of HCoV-229E the first strain of B814's snot patients were exposed to the selecosis, the various CoVs were isolated from various infected animals, which include turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The brief summary of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the patient's airway that had upper respiratory infection in 1966, which was next to be adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
The infected patient HCoV-229E shows symptoms of selessing, which include headaches, sneezes, lethargic, and throat pains, with fever and cough visible at 10 ~ 20% of the cases.
Next, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and serial paths in the brain which still suckled.
Clinical images of HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E, which are systematically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be most transmitted during the winter in a medium-climate area.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by an illness for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected by HCoV-229E is suffering from a mild selective.
There are very few patients with weakened immune systems that indicate a severe low-breath infection.
SARS, also known as "thin pneumonia," is the first HCoV pandemic that was well documented in human history and its ethical agents were SARS-Cov, which was the third HCoV found.
The first case SARS can be traced back to the late 2002 Guangdong Province, China.
Epidema SARS resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super chargers, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus visible on the 10th day of the disease.
The patient who was infected with SARS-Cov was originally mialgia, headaches, fever, lethargic, and shivering, followed by dispnea, cough, and asphyxiation as advanced symptoms.
Limpophenia, abnormal liver function test, and increased creatin kinase is a common laboratory disorder in SARS.
The damage to alveolar diffusion, proliferation of the epithelial cells, and the increase of macrophages is also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20 to 30% of the patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory channels, several organs that include gastrointestinal channels, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by cytokin storms, which can be deadly, especially with patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open pulmonary biopsy of patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, an enormous effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old boy from Holland in the late 2004.
The virus was originally very common in young children, elderly, and weakened patients with respiratory disease.
Coriza images, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same viral isolation from a 8-month-old male specimen suffering from pneumonia in Holland.
Although it was identified in Holland, it was actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory diseases and the culmination of events occurred in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with objective laryngitis, called crup.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and the community's bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exhibition.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found around the world, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four HCov communities have all adapted to humans and generally have very little chance of mutating to a highly pathogenic disease.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans, it's also less virulent and less HCoV coordination.
MERS-Cov was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patient's lungs to acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most lab-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, importing cases with the occasional secondary deployment to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MARS clinical manifestations resemble the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have had acute kidney failure, which so far has only happened to MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show symptoms of gastrointestinal, like diarrhea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed the lab was reported with the death of a high-profile case, which is 34.4%, made the MERS-CoV one of the scariest viruses known to man.
In the middle until the end of December 2019, a pneumonia patient cluster that is retrospectively associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of the low-breath infection is underway and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
Up until March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a rough death rate of 3.4%.
For the record, case death in Hubei, China, 4.2%, while case death outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Diare was also encountered in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can evolve rapidly into acute asphyxiation syndrome.
Even though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because homology is a high sequence of nucleotides, by 82%, they are clustered into different branch of the philosophical tree.
The Patogonicity SARS-CoV-2 is definitely lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 with no symptoms has been reported and may be involved in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world.
Compare and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from six other HCoV shows a very interesting equation and difference.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the travel of HCoV's disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other communities of HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common description of the community's HCOV infection, which includes a description of mild nonspecific symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of the severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-Cov infections even though they're a little lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows the characteristics of an interesting pattern, similar to the HCOV community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV community.
On the other hand, decreasing the transmission capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 after multiple pathways in humans still need to be verified, as the case of SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV.
Lastly, just like every other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the sample feses.
"Whether SARS-COV-2 fecal-oral transmission is important, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it must still be clarified by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as in the HCoV community case.
However, the images of SARS-CoV-2, which include transmission capabilities, pataggenicity, and the spread continues on several pathways in humans, will be very influential on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCov communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Judging from another point of view, it's fair to say humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be species of ancient HCoV survivors.
The HCoV that causes severe human and human diseases has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV has to replicate in humans in an adequate amount to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations against the constraint factor of the host.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more infected people are infected, the more likely this virus is to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus adapts well, the transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other form of infection control.
Over the years, four CoV communities circulate in the human population and trigger a selective in immunocompetence people.
This virus doesn't require animal reservoirs.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly patagenic yet adaptable to humans and its transitions in humans are untenable.
Both had to defend themselves and do breeding in the zoonotic reservoir as well as look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or several intermediaries and mplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has an image similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four HCov communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted like the HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more patagenic than the HCoV community and not the sutotogenic SARS-CoV or the MERS-CoV.
Still must be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to humans and calculate in humans without a host of animals or mediators.
Before discussing the origin of the HCoV animal, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary host, natural, reservoir, middleman, and amplification of HCoV.
The animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV if it has a close relative ancestor and shares a high homology at a nucleotides sequent level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is noncombatant in this host.
Likewise, the host of the reservoir carries the HCoV on a constant and long period of time.
In those two cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the mother virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV had just entered the mediator right before or around the time the virus got into the human body, the virus had not adapted to the new host and has often been pagorical.
This medium can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an implication host by allowing the virus to replicate in a temporary way, and then transmit it to humans to maximize the scale of human infections.
HCoV can have a dead end infection if it can't maintain its transmission in a mediator.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediaries and even cause long-term endeminess.
In this case, the host is a natural host of reservoir.
The epidemiological data reveals retrospective that the SARS zero case has a history of contact with the hunted.
The next seroprevalence study indicates that the peddler has a higher anti-SARS-Cov prevalence than the general population.
Moon Weasel (Pagoma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market are the first identified carrying a similar-SARS-Cov virus that's almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, it's supported by the fact that there are no more SARS cases reported since all the badgers in the market were killed.
The moon weasel from the wild or the farm that was not exposed to the live animal market gave most of the negative results for SARS-CoV.
For the record, because 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also function as an intermediate agency of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts seem to be the ultimate host of SARS-CoV.
The search for the natural animal host for SARS-Cov further revealed the close relative bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus Bats-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is on the Chinese horseshoe bat.
This bat gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCov Haku3.
This cov and other bat cov share homologous nucleotides 88-92% with SARS-Cov.
This study became the foundation for the new concept that the bat was the host for the newly emerged human pathogen.
Some of the CoV-like SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
The enzyme modifier angiosin 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-Cov receptor.
The WIV1 from the bat feses samples were shown using the Ace2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors to get into the cell.
Interestingly, the patient's SARS Convalescent serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor to SARS-CoV at bat, which is 95% of nuclear homology.
Despite the height of these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV and bat is not a direct host of SARS-CoV.
Phiogenetic analysis grouped the MES-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU bats and CoV-HKU 5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, which is on the tip of peptidase 4, as the entrance to the virus.
Sequens RNA polymerase dependent RNA MERS-CoV are philosophically closer to its coordinates in beta-Cov bats identified from Europe and Africa.
Until recently, there has been no live MERS-CoV found in a wild bat.
MES-CoV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87% of the nucleotides homology sequences.
Therefore, the bat may not be a host of a direct MARS-Cov reservoir.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that the Arab camels provide a seropositive result for specific antibodies that neutralizes the MERS-CoV, just like the Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus that was found in humans isolated from the Arab camel nasal paste.
It's also important to note that massive virus decay with symptoms that are normally lightly observed on camel experiments infected with the MERS-Cov.
For the record, the infected camels straightened the virus not only through respiratory routes, but also through fecal oral routes, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
Nevertheless, the question remains unanswered because many of the MERS cases are confirmed to have no record of contact with camels prior to symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologous with a RATG13 baton Cov isolated from the Rholophus affinis bat.
Like in the SARS-CoV case and the MERS-CoV, the semblance difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is too big to establish parent relationships.
In other words, the bat may not be a direct host of SARS-CoV-2, unless the bat Cov is almost identical found later on.
The host of SARS-CoV-2 is among the wildlife species sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Grocer Market, many early cases of COVID-19 related to this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some of the latest studies based on the metagenomic sequencing show that a group of endangered little mammals, known as trenggills, may also bring beta-Cov relatives with SARS-CoV-2.
This new cov culmination genome shares 85-92% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as close to RatG13 as 90% equal at a nucleotide sequence level.
Both are grouped into two virus sublines similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a filogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor (RBD) domain that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4 percent equivalent of amino acid.
The striking thing is, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 are much more different, although the secular homology levels of the entire genome are higher.
Previously on sick trenggiling also reported detection of the virus from the lung sample, which also turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different drafting methods and manual curations to produce partial genome sequences that consisted of about 86.3% of the full virus genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of trenggiling as one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediaries.
However, there is no evidence currently support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the trenggilling because of the secular differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-Cov relatives-SARS-CoV-2 entrenched.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-Cov relatives-SARS-Cov-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 at bat, trenggiling, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although the highest-secular homology on RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homology at the Sequens level of the entire genome.
Too speculating if it is said that the high levels of resemblance between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-2 trenggiling and SARS-CoV-2 are moved by the selectiveness of convergence evolution.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between beta-Cov relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination is common among beta-CoV.
The researchers still haven't been able to decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoV's highly patagenic origin, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phiogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have come from the bat's CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat Cov called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was detected in a three-color bat in North America showing close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to the other bat CoV, with the name Hyposoderos / Ghanakwam / 19 / 2008, which is detected in Ghana, with Camelidae suspected to be also the intermediate host.
To be clear, the current knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals is summed up in Image 1 and Table 2.
A philosophical analysis has provided evidence of the incident of an interspecies HCoV transmission in history.
In around 1890, when HCov-OC43 passed a species of livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infection.
The history of the HCoV-229E transmission interspecies is unclear.
Alpha-Cov bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
In between the two, there's alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from the bat to the human being.
First, man, not alpaca, who may be in contact with bats in a joint ecological rally.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the alpha-Cov bat is related to HCoV-229E. There are various and noncombinatorial bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Lastly, the alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in the feral animal.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting the alpha-Cov relative-HCoV-229E of humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, the bat is a direct source for the human phimonic virus, which includes the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it's not too surprising that the bat might instantly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while alpha-Cov bat acts as a HCoV-229E gene, alpaka and Arabic camels may function as a mediator transitioning the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for transmitting interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV of the bat is known in the initial identification of the virus and also amplified with the findings afterwards.
It's obvious that bats are a rich species of virus for exchange of genetic fragments interspecies and interspecies transmissions.
A long life, a rigorous colony, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all of which is a supportive condition for bats to be the ideal host of viruses.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been going into Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have gone from intermediaries to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very light diseases and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in this animal.
Sporadic transitions occur by chance and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV because the transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of trenggiling, if anything, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, beta-cov trenggiling is highly paggenic in trenggrind.
Tenggilling may be the final host for the beta-Cov relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the SARS-Cov case.
In future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans must be calculated or ruled out.
First, the bat could be the host of the reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that's almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological ravines with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, trenggilling could be one of the intermediaries for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Man gets the virus through slaughter and consumption of flesh.
Perhaps, many mammals, who include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
The antibody survey of pets and wild animals needs to be done.
Third, as mentioned at the top, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species in contact with both bats and trenggills.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Apart from all kinds of animal hosts, three key factors from the virus side are also essential to ease the CoV across the species barrier.
First, the rate of mutation is relatively high in the replication of RNA.
Compared to other single-stringed RNA viruses, approximate the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "being" to "high" at average substitution rate by ~ 10-4 per path, depending on the cov adaptation phase to new host.
CoV has an exorcism, a correction, a removal that leads to very high mutability, atenuation, or even invisibility.
The interesting thing is, the analog nucleotides of Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through this exorcism of exorimaclease and RNA polymerase depends-RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, CoV mutation rate is about a million times higher than its host mutation rate.
Besides, the rate of mutation is often high when CoV hasn't adapted to the host yet.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high rate of mutation, the rate of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, signifying a higher adaptation rate with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts who are close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to the MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, the less likely that genetic suction will quickly create vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become ineffective.
Second, a large genome of RNA in the CoV gives extra immunity in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of co-evolution interspecies, which is lucrative for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by many unique open read frame and protein functions encoded to the tip of 3 genomes.
Third, the CoV often changes the template randomly during the replication of RNA through a unique "select-copy" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, a continual transition occurred during the RNA Cov transcription.
The complete RNA and subgenomics that are very homologous can recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination philosophical evidence has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as on CoV animals like SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the event of interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis of human SARS-Cov and ferret, SARS-CoV is suspected to be fast adaptable to multiple hosts, especially with mutations at the RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD S Cov protein interacts with cell receptors and is intensively a target of the antibody response host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD was the 318 to 510 amino acid in the S1 fragment, which is bound to the human Ace2 and its teleceptors as the entrance to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the Ace2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, badgers, rats, and raccoon dogs, which allow interspecies virus transmissions.
Actually, only six amino acid residue were observed differently between the insulate of the human virus and the ferret at RBD and 4 are located in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the Ace2 receptor.
SARS-Cov weasel has a mutation of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of protein bulge interactions with human Ace2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acids substitution may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
Note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference by 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S-protein unit implicates the S protein binding affinity with human Ace2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows human Ace2 binding affinity and SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity of human Ace2 and the S SARS-Cov proteins.
The only thing that's also important to know is whether any other coreceptors might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to the ACE2, but with different parts of the U.S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and siallic acid 9-O-teracelation for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also be involved in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the transmission between species of its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the final result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by the factor of dependency and limitation of other hosts.
The difference between the protein host and the host of natural reservoir, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmissions.
HCoV must take over the host dependency factor and break the host limitation factor to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular decisiveness of these important virus interactions still needs to be identified and printed.
Enhancement of the entire genome is not biased to see the dependency and restriction factor of SARS-CoV-2 host using advanced CRISP technology may be useful.
A new HCoV appearance: returning to the beginning of the outbreak.
The diversity of the bat Cov gives a great opportunity for a new HCoV to appear.
In this case, the bat Cov acts as a HCoV gene lever.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drives HCoV evolution and acts as two crucial steps in this process.
For example, production or loss of new protein encoder genes is potentially drastically modifying the virus phentype.
Amongst an isolated SARS-CoV protein, ORF8 is thought to be an important role in adapting to humans due to the isolated SARS-Cov relative virus, which was found to be a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-Cov with the typical removal of 29 nucleotides was found in a strain isolated in the early human epidemic.
This eviction separates ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation supporting the host transition.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV lineage and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase that depend on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and some nsp14.
Likewise, the recombination events between different lineage are shown in the Era MES-CoV, which happens in Saudi Arabia's Arab camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed on other HCOV where HCoV recombines with other animal CoVs in its non-structure genes.
It should also be aware that artificial selection can play a role in an unintentional change in the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the pressure of the selection that it experienced, as with the host immune system.
This sample effect is the complete missing ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While the whole ORF4 can be observed on bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka shows a single nucleotide shift that leads to a shift of order.
Finally, new HCoV evolution is also driven by the pressure of selection in its host of reservoirs.
A mild or undetectable symptom when a bat is infected with the CoV, which shows an adaptation between the CoV and the bat.
It seems the bats adapt well with the CoV anatomy and physiology.
For example, a flaw in activating the proinflammation response to the bat will lower the pathology triggered by CoV efficiently.
Moreover, natural killer cell activity on the bat is suppressed due to the increase in natural cell receptor regulation of the NKG2 / CD94 and the level of complex molecular expression of lower grade histocompatibility.
Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from high-impact metabolic bat activity can suppress the CoV replication and affect the orientation by the exorcism and force the selection to create a very pygenic strain when entering the new host.
A more patagenic strain of CoV might also develop through recombination, resulting in any protein production or new protein features to adapt the host.
Therefore, it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
Cov is non-patrogenic or causes mild symptoms in the host of the reservoirs, like bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
Here lies the secret of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of a severe case of human infection.
The symptoms are particularly severe due to overactivating immune response as well as cytokin storms, with less severe lung damage if immune response is getting stronger.
On the contrary, on the uncharacteristic carrier, the immune response is off the grid of the CoV replication.
The same strategy to determine the connection to the immune response might be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Response interferon especially strong on bats.
Therefore, giving off type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be useful.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammation on the bat is defective.
For this reason, the NLRP3 inflammatory inhibation with MCC950 may be useful in the handling of COVID-19.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV.
While beta-Cov bats that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also Cov bats that share 96% of nuclear homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the weasel and other animals in the market were found carrying a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the mediator directly for SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be found.
Beta-CoV trenggiling with a very homologous SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, which suggests that trenggilling may play one of the intermediaries or beta-Cov trenggelling may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While it remains in question, there has been no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans on purpose or by accident.
CoV has returned to the center of attention due to recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies on bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir to HCoV on human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and transmitted to humans via intermediaries.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection came from contact between humans and badgers in the wet market, perhaps the closing of the wet market and the killing of all the mongrels in it that ended the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, the trenggiling should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, given the discovery of several beta-Cov trenggiling lineage close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanism SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through trenglling and other mammals still have to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camels for a long time.
This camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local people.
Arab camels spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't possibly kill all the camels to control the MERS, like the one in China's wild animal market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop a vaccine for camels that are effective against MERS-Cov and combined with other form of infection control.
Before we can eliminate this virus, new genotypes can arise and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoV circulates in the wild.
Specifically, the potentially zoonotic bat Cov is very diverse.
There are many possible possibilities for this cov zoonotic to evolve and recombination, which result in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and / or more deadly to the future human beings.
Culture eats wild animals in some places in China must be left to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the preparation and better countermeasures should be applied.
In fact, a lot of viruses have been on this planet a long time ago.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there's a chance for deployment.
Although bats have many traits that support the spread of the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Advanced surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the CoV ecology and its natural host, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals-to-humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is that humans should keep the distance from the ecological rally of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some pieces of the zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2 puzzle have yet to be found.
First, if the bat transmits an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the trenggilling, the condition when the bat and the trenggrind share an ecological rally is an important thing to know.
Secondly, if the bat has a more direct role in transmitting to humans, the way a human contact with the bat must be determined.
Third, if there's a third mammal that acts as a mediator in fact, the way that it interacts with other species, that includes humans, bats, and trenggrind must be made clear.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance have to do.
Either bats, trenggills, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its mother virus which is almost identical can be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation into this field will decipher the evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 pathways in animals, with important implications in prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating expected diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory guide for diagnostics and handling the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCov).
Nevertheless, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) disease is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing in the discovery of ongoing research and clinical practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and handling are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "unexpected" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnostic Guide and Prevention for the COVID-19 version (the seventh) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had now caused a outbreak, which is now formally called the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and it was named the Koronavirus. Heavy respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described the COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance and the guide has been published online at the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has drawn a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it is worth noting that the COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on the discovery of ongoing research as well as clinical practical experiences; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and handling is also continuing to be updated.
For example the Diagnostic Guide and Prevention for CoVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), between January 16 and 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some of the context has been changed quite a lot.
Our guides received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score-giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guidance and became a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires updates based on Diagnosis and Handlers for the latest COVID-19 (version of the seven trials) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm the case is expected to be a combination of one of the epidemiological histories with two clinical manifestations to create a comprehensive analysis, or it takes three clinical manifestations if there's no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) Travel history or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or any other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the disease; (2) contact with the infectious case of SARS-CoV-2 (with nuclear acid test); (3) contact history with patients who have a fever or symptoms from the city of Wuan and surrounding areas, or any other community where the COVID case has been reported in the last 4 days, (a case (a positive case in a case (a case), (a case in 4 or a class), (a hospital), (-2 in a case in a case in a school), (a case in a case in a case in a case in a case in a case in a minor in a minor in 4 or a class), or a school), or in a class) ------2) -----------4 -2) --------------------------------------4 ---4 -4 --------------2 -4 -4 -2)
Clinical manifestations: (1) Paralysis and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) CoVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total count of white blood cells showing normal lymphocytes, decreasing, or decreasing in the early-age stages.
Verified case diagnosis confirmed should be based on one of the expected cases with one of the specific pathological or serological evidence as follows: (1) PCR test of real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2 tests; (2) the entire sequence of the virus's homogenity is shown to be a new coronavirus, (3) positive for an IgM antibody specific antibody against SARS-2 test in a positive test of SARS-CoV-2, or a positive change of the SGGSGSGGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSGSG2 is increasing is are are are are are are are are are are increasing to be up at a positive.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acid in the respiratory sample or blood is added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Patogenic detection of the blood sample is added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, cerological evidence is added in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on ongoing research of researchers to search for optimal nucleic detection kits for rapid diagnostics, as well as samples from the airways including blood-feeding, which increase the availability of various specimens, and support importing certain positive outcomes into confirmed criteria.
Besides, there's more and more evidence that reminds us to be aware of patients with antidotes and no symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou Let. Alir chart must be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "unexpected cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest to follow and obey the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a favor.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day for the virus.
Up until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infections recorded covering 114 active cases and 33 cured cases that live in the house.
It's a total of 17 deaths.
In an online news fair, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, says death covers four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 to 50.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead were Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bengali, who was hospitalized at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Transport Road and Bridge, the Obalak Quaders said public transportation would be terminated longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This stops public transportation has been started since March 26th and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4th.
Transportation of basic goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- still allowed.

The stores in Australia lower the limit of the purchase of toilet paper per transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays in the afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles stores network each lowered the limitation of toilet paper purchases to two and a pack per transaction in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applied a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These restrictions were announced as a message on the cashier's desk and on his Facebook page.
The buyer was reported stacking up on fear of COVID-19 in case the public had to do self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for delivery home to one pack per order.
These changes follow the limitation of four packs per transaction that Woolworths and Coles previously applied each on March 4th and 5th.
On his medical statement on March 8, Coles reported that with a four-pack restrictions, "many stores have been running out within an hour of the shipment," and called that request unprecedented, "while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it" unexpected. "
Sales "escalated" last week, according to one of Woolworths' spokesmen.
Costco stores in Canberra also limit the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packaging than the suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the peritel tried to increase the supplies, but the local government limits for the delivery time of the truck made it difficult.
He anticipated rising production costs, while suppliers were trying to meet demand, and less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that for releasing early supplies, some stores couldn't have special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store was filling up supplies every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper was a huge volume of stuff so that the amount of supply was low and, if sold out, made a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of things grew.
Coles and Woolworths argued that if there were a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and masturbation could be [purchased] and there could be a huge amount of it, panic could be minimized, that Russel Zimmerman could go through the ABC News Office.
Who gives a crap toilet paper producer said last Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed them working 24 / 7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.aute's report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some real estate vendors offer free toilet paper to the first bidder of the Melbourne auction, when fewer auctions are held because the buyers take pause for the long holiday weekend Labor Day.
Thursday's edition NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, includes eight side pages intended to cut and use as toilet paper.
The stores were actually reluctant to apply boundaries, according to the Australian ABC report on March 3rd, they said that they weren't planning on applying the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, torture, dried food, hand sanitizer, and flour.
As well as outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket of Ocado was observed to limit the purchase of andans toilet paper to two packs containing 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-COV-2 - as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how vast the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO records the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the state detects, tests, handles, isolate, and mobilizes its people as response, it says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We're both very late because of the vastness and severity that concerns us and because of the level of indifference of worrying action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the United States Disease Control Center, this pandemic has never happened before.
He said, in the records that CNN published in February, "apart from influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been traced from its appearance to a sustainable global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus."
It goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
New status pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare this epidemic as an emergency to the world's troubling community.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says about this outbreak, "essentially, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 is the 2019 coravirus pandemic that is being continued and caused by the coronavirus's acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Pestilence was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared as an emergency of the World's Ancients on January 30, 2020, and declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, which result in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Case fatality numbers are estimated 4% in China, while around the world ranging from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
General symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time since exposure to symptoms are at most about five days, but it can go from two to fourteen days.
No known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment.
The main treatment of simptomatic and supportive therapies, the preventive actions that are recommended include washing your hands, shutting your mouth when you cough, keeping your distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enacting travel boundaries, quarantine, curfew, control of the danger of the workplace, and the closing of facilities.
This pandemic has caused heavy social economic disorder, delay or annulment of cultural, political, religious, exercise, and the vastness of supply of goods to be exacerbated by the purchase of panic.
Schools and universities have closed down both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects about 99.4 percent of the population of students around the world.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there's a xenophobic incident and discrimination against Chinese people, people with offspring and the appearance of East Asia and Southeast Asia, and people who come from areas with significant viruses.
Due to heavy industrial reduction in travel and closure, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health Authority in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reporting a cluster of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Grocer Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, a virus that was recently discovered and related to the bat coronavirus, the coronavirus beheading, and SARS-Cov, the first person with symptoms later known to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person did not have a clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case clasters reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a connection to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to the 17th of November, 2019, in a 55-year-old man from the Hubei province was probably the first.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Until February 26th, relative to the number of cases reported among young men, with people of 19 down to form 2.4% cases around the world, the head of British scientific advisor Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
Case refers to the number of people who have tested the COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made the official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, Holland, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that China, until January 23, was estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undocumented, and that undocumented infections were the source of an infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published in March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be larger than the cases reported.
The initial estimate of the base reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that the number is probably 5.7.
Most of the CoVID-19 are cured.
For those who haven't recovered, time since the development of the symptoms up to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5th, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years old and 75% of them have preexisting health disorders, covering cardiovascular and diabetic cardiovascular disease. Official death calculations due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to dead people who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, considering the official number probably doesn't include people who died untested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the number of excess death rates during the pandemic transcended the official COVID count with a 4-5 factor.
A female spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Prevention) admitted, "We know that the number of deaths is lower than the actual number," a non-scientific report on the count is too low in the US.
The first death outside of China land occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28th, outside of China land, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Up to March 13th, more than forty countries and territorial areas have reported death, on every continent, except Antarctica, in general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies based on regions and over time, and is influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the handling options, the time of the first outbreak, and the character of the population like age, gender and health as a whole.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death to the case globally is 6.0% (97.039 / 1,617.204) by April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In China, the estimate of death ratio of cases is decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms equal to 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Another measure includes the number of cases fatality, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with disease, and the number of fatal infections (IFR), which reflect the percentage of infected (undiagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not bound in time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Providence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infection fatality for pandemic is overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper range of these estimates is consistent with the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis of the impact of scaling at CFR estimates.
The WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The culmination and end duration of this outbreak are unclear and possibly different according to the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Without control, infectious outbreaks are often flat and then decreasing when the disease runs out of hosts available.
However, it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection today about when it happens. "
Senior medical advisor of the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan argued that "The outbreak might end June" if the whole country could be mobilized to follow the WHO's rare suggestion of the step-rare to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that the SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or so)."
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University stated, "I think there's little chance that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and this disease "might turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repetition virulations will depend on group immunity and mutation levels.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough dry (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production (flegma), loss of smell, asphyxiation, contusions, joint pain, throat pain, shivering, hemoptisis, diarrhea, or cynicism.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include signs of emergency including difficulty breathing, chest distress or abrupt confusion, constriction of travel, and blueness in the face and the medical attention immediately advised that if further disease may be a severe pneumonia, an acute syndrome, acidic shock, and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic, which is without clinical symptoms, but with the results of the tests confirming the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those in close contact with the infected should be monitored and checked to make sure they're not infected.
The Chinese estimate an acumatomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) is usually between 1 to 14 days, at most 5 days.
The details of the way this disease spread are still being studied.
CoVID-19 is believed mainly at close contact time and through a small droplet produced during a cough, sneeze, or speech; close contact is a contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that an uncovered cough can cause a droplet to go 4.5 feet (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that a virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is generated as it speaks; it can also be generated when breathing, including when speaking, even though the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can fall in the mouth or the nose of the person nearby or maybe inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation, can turn the respiratory sequence into aerosol and spread through the air.
The spread can also happen when a person hits the contaminated surface, including skin, then it touches the eyes, the nose, and the mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feses, these risks are believed to be low.
The Chinese government denounced the possibility of transmission SARS-CoV-2 in a fecal way. The most contagious virus in the first three days after an acid symptom, although the spread may occur before symptoms are visible and at a stage of further disease.
People gave positive test results up to three days before the symptoms, which suggests transmission may have occurred before significant symptoms.
There are very few cases of acumatomatic reports confirmed in the lab, but an asymptomatic contagion has been identified by several countries during the investigation of contact search.
The European Disease Control and Prevention Center states that even though it's not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person generally infects two to three other people, it can survive on the surface for hours and days.
Specifically, it was discovered that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastic and corrosive steel 304, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature, pets and other animals have tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with the surface that might have been touched by an infected person.
The coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia-related people related to the case of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus traits are linked to coronavirus in nature.
Virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically classified with the Betaronavirus genus, in the sarbecovirus subgenus (B) along with two strains of the bat derivative.
This virus has 96% in common at the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference between amino acids in certain parts of the genome semens between the betagilling virus and the human virus.
Up until today, the comparison of the entire genome found the most 92% of the genetic materials between the mackerel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, was not enough to prove that the mackling is the host of SARS-CoV-2.
The infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually carried out through a countertranscription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in an infected sector or overriding CT imaging.
A study that compares between PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that the CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT may not be used for tagging or as a first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first distributed on January 17th.
Testing uses the polymerase chain reaction transcription back real-time (RT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a respiratory sample or blood.
Generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on naguofaring sashes, but the throat can also be used, and a number of labs and companies are developing a serological test that detects antibodies.
As per April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its use widely.
In the U.S., the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified labs.
The characteristic of radiographic imaging features and computing tomography in people who are symptomatic covers the opacity of ground glass periphers asymmetry and no efusion pleura.
Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings in confirmed cases.
Because overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited speciality in identifying COVID-19.
A great study in China compared the chest CT results to PCR and shows that despite being less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it's advised to be considered a scaling tool in the epidemic area.
The neural network of a revolutionary-based artificial intelligence has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent the contagion of this disease is to maintain comprehensive personal hygiene, wash your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and use a tissue while coughing or sneezing and just throw a tissue in the trash.
People who might have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
The physical restrictions are also recommended to prevent the contagion.
However, the virus has reached a scale-spreading stage of society in most of the world.
This means that viruses have spread to the community, and some members of the community don't know where or how they are infected; health care providers that deal with people who may be infected are advised to perform standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important step for the health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further contagion.
The use of cell phone locations for this purpose has sparked a privacy issue, with the release of Amnesty International statements and over 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance restrictions.
Various cellular applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7th, 2020, over a dozen groups of experts working on a private friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the user's proximity to another cell phone.
Next, users will receive messages if they're close to someone tested positive for COVID-19.Rising misunderstandings on how to prevent infection; for example, rinse your nose and rinse with mouthwash.
There hasn't been a CoVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after coming out of the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; as well as having eaten nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This passion is because, outside of the human body, the virus was killed by household soap that damaged its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand-tormenting alcohol at least 60% based on the volume of when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people not to touch eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands.
Surface can be decontaminated using a number of solution (in a minute disinfected exposure to a steel-resistant surface of 62-71%, isosopanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Other barrel, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin glukonat, is less effective.
CDC recommends that if there's a suspected case of COVID or confirmed in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas like offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic equipment together like tablet, touchscreen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the patient, should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with a bent elbow or use a tissue while coughing or sneezing, then immediately disposing of a tissue.
Surgery masks are recommended to people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and mileage of the exponential droplets that spread when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on time and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with an unclean enough hand, which is a major source of contagion." The mask is also recommended to be worn by someone who's taken care of someone else who might have this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they're high-risk, like people taking care of a COVID-19 patient, although WHO also admitted that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have started pushing the use of masks to members of society.
China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to a healthy society, especially when close to one foot or less, to another.
Hong Kong recommends surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbids its citizens from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16th, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear facial masks while going public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the market to wear facial masks.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear facial masks while they were in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks a day since the middle of March, requires passengers on the train and interstate buses wearing facial masks on April 1st.
Panama requires the use of facial masks every time outside the house, as well as recommending making homemade masks for those who can't buy facial masks.
Facial masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction is an act of control of infection that is intended to slow down disease by minimizing close-up contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply the method of social limitation by staying home, limit travel, avoid crowded areas, use a greeting without contact, and maintain physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or impose social limitation in the affected areas of the outbreak.
The maximum numbers of people gathered are recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations are quickly reduced, starting with 250 people (if not known to be a set of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then become 10 people.
In March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people.
The use of the term "social limitation" suggests that people should isolate themselves entirely socially and not encourage people to keep in touch with others in alternative ways, some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during pandemic.
This recommendation includes the suggestion of having sex with only the people who live with you and have no virus or symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended to people diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for self-isolation.
The most rigorous self-quarantine instructions are issued to people who include high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to countries or areas with vast COVID-19 spread are advised to maintain a 14-day self-quarantine since the time of the last exposure.
The strategy in controlling the plague is justification or depression, as well as mitigation.
The dam was carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and intended to track and isolate the infected and make other steps to control infection and vaccinations that intended to stop the spread of diseases throughout the population.
When it's impossible to contain the spread of the disease, the next attempt is to move on to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce the impact on the health care system and society.
Combination of justification and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Depression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.part of the epidemic management is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known as the curvature of the epidemic.
It lowers the risk of overwhelmed health care and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the epidemic includes individual prevention, such as hand hygiene, wearing facial masks, and self-quarantine; steps on the level of the society are intended for physical restrictions, such as shutting down schools and canceling mass meetings, community security to push for concession and intervention in such an environmental level; and steps in the environment, such as surface cleaning; other drastic measures are intended to contain the plague in the China as the disease gets more real, such as to contain the entire city and the strict ban of travel.
Other countries also apply different steps that aim to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass anointing and local quarantine, and issued a warning about the movement of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected who are doing self-quarantine and charge a huge fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and penalizes medical stockholders, simulations for the British and the United States show that the mitigation (slows down, but doesn't stop the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) has a huge challenge.
Optimal mitigation policy can reduce demand for health care to 2 / 3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Depression can be chosen, but it needs to be kept as long as the virus is still in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise, the contagion will soar back quickly when the suppression measures are backed up.
Long-term intervention to suppress pandemic brings impact on social and economic.
There hasn't been a specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is underway, which includes existing testing.
Consume free flu medicine, drink enough water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be necessary.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the patient's condition.
Some of the earlier compounds were approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional treatment and home" can defuse symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health care to patient needs COVID-19 is a fundamental step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and European regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for primary hospitals and health care in order to divert resources at various levels, including focusing lab services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel the electrical procedure, separate and isolate positive patient COVID-19, and improve intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Humanan Sea Grocer Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that viruses come from one of these kinds of animals; or, in other words, viruses have zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about coronavirus similar SARS.
These eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and others, Ai Fen, were reprimanded by his superiors because of the warnings he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed WHO.
Quite a number of unknown pneumonia cases reported to health authorities in Wuhan that later triggered the investigation in early January, in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.
In early and middle January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan was the transportation center and transit of the main train.
On January 20th, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6.174 people have suffered symptoms on January 20, 20.Per March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world, until April 9, 2020, over 1,61 million cases have been reported around the world; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region limit free movement and create border control.
The national response includes damnation measures, such as quarantine (known as house order, shelter order in place, or quarantine areas) and nighttime; on April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in a sort of quarantine of areas in the United States, over 50 million people quarantined areas in the Philippines, about 59 million people quarantined areas in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people quarantined in India.

This also led to 33 to 43% of the pedestrian traffic to the shopping mall in March compared to February.
A shopping center operator around the world has imposed additional measures, such as the increase in sanitation, a thermal scanner installation to check the buyer's temperature, and cancel the event. According to the UN Economics Commission for Latin America, a recession caused by pandemic can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to grow between 14 and 22 million people compared to a situation without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates to reach 32%.
During the second half of March, four million French workers filed temporary unemployment benefits and a million British workers filed a universal credit scheme nearly half a million companies in Germany filed short-term jobs subsidized by the government for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Around the world, the art sector of the show and cultural heritage are impacted by pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent.
The organization of art and cultural sectors seeks to uphold their mission (which is often public-funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, to maintain the safety of employees and communities, and support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, showplaces, and other cultural institutions were shut down indefinitely, with exhibits, events, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were deployed to provide alternative services through digital platforms; the impairment of the disease that was recently and very rapidly developing was the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and fashion demonstrations.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which crashed in the last week of the season of repentance for Kristen Prapaskah, was canceled.
Many archdiocese encourage Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services via radio, live broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-ins or floors.
With the closing of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic archdiocese and the emptying of Saint Peter's Field of Christianity, other religious agencies also called off services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, temples, and gurdwarves.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced a cancellation of Friday in the affected areas of plague and places of worship was then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sports events are canceled or postponed, including the UEFA League 2019-2020, the Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA Season 2019-2020, and NHL Season 2019-2020.
This epidemic is ruining the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be rescheduled until after 2020, but it will not be more than the summer 2021. "." In the world, casinos and other games are closed and live broadcast poker tournaments are cancelled or canceled.
This led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new registration, and the entertainment industry had also been affected, with various bands delaying or canceling the concert tour.
Many great theater like Broadway also delayed all performances.
Artists explore different ways of continuing to produce and share work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live-show, like live-broadcast concerts online or creating a "festival" for artists to perform, to spread, and publish their works.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes spread online with the number of people who turn to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the CoVID-19, observed increased prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and Eastern Asia, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese deserve a virus or accept what they claim as a reward.
Some countries in Africa also experience an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination because of their origins.
There's been support for the Chinese, either online or offline, and for people in the affected areas of the virus.
The people of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, were originally signing a petition to ban the Chinese from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, hashtag # Chineet DontComeToJapan became the trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United States and the United States are reporting increased levels of racism and assault.
President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus "the Chinese virus," which critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses that took Ukraine and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students who come from Northeast India, who are bordering on China, and studying in large cities India are reported to be abused regarding the coronavirus outbreak.
The President of the Bharatiya Party Janata state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh states that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God has avenged them."
The statement was later treated by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, by calling it "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens was burned by pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "banishment."
A lot of newspapers using paid-off treasury have deleted it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the plague available with open access.
Some scientists choose to hand out the results quickly on preprintable servers, like bioRxiv.
New infectious diseases - new pathogen infections appear, often new times in the reach of plague or the method of contagion.

The list of epidemic and pandemic - the list of fatalities due to infectious diseases.
Wildlife smuggling and zoonosis - health risks associated with exotic wildlife trade.
Lab testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the method that detects the existence of the virus and that detects the antibodies that are produced as a response to infection.
The existence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects RNA coronavirus.
These tests are specific and designed to detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 virus solely.
This test was used to confirm a new infection or still active.
Antibody detection can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
The antibody test shows the number of people already infected, including people whose symptoms are too light to be reported or with no symptoms.
Morality rate of accurate diseases and group immunity levels can be determined by these test results.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has had reliable data about the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are huge variations in the amount of testing that countries have done.
These variations may also affect the significant number of fatality cases reported, which are most likely to be calculated too high in some countries.
Using a real-time backlog polymerase chain reaction, this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained with various methods, including naspreading or sputum samples.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR tests performed on throat sashes are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Eventually, the virus can disappear in the throat while constantly replicating in the lungs.
As an alternative, for infected people being tested in the second week, sample materials can be taken from deep breath channels by using suck catheters or materials that are issued through cough can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using a reaction to polymerase transcription back real-time (RRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
United Kingdom also developed testing on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) based on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that all beta coravirus owns, and the RdRp gene specifically for SARS-CoV-2 in China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to accept emergency use of Chinese National Medical Production Administration for the SARS-Cov-2-based PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the RT-CR-CR-Real-2019 Reontime GN-2019's Reaural's Rec (social.
One of the three genetic tests on the old version test tool provided inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; it resulted in less than 100 samples a day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components is considered unreliable until February 28th, 2020, and only after that, state labs and local labs are allowed to conduct tests.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Superintendent by Emergency Use Authorization.
Per March 5, 2020, LabCorp announces the availability of COVID-19 based RT-PCR on a national scale.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 test available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Virological State Research Center and the Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by Federal Services for Health Services on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported developing a test to detect the COVID-19 infection.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories for testing on m2000 Abbott's system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for tests that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using isostermal nucleic acid technology which is not PCR.
Since it doesn't require a series of temperature changes, it can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipated to increase production to make 50,000 tests a day. A test that uses monocronal antibodies that specifically binds nuclear proteins to new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like fast influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "small diagnostic photos in the early stages, as the CT findings [computed tomography] may have existed before the acetate."
The typical feature on the CT includes ground-glass opacity of a bilateral multilobar with peripheral distribution, asymmetry and posterior.
The dominance of subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidation formed as the progression of the disease.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many overlap imaging features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology recommended "CT may not be used for tagging or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for an initial enclosure.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that includes IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after the symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. The checks can be used in the central lab (CLT) or with the point of of care testing.
The high-yield automatic system in many clinical labs will be able to do this examination, but its availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, generally used one specimen of peripheral blood, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune response.
For the Pocx, it's generally used by a specimen of peripheral blood that's obtained through a skin prick.
Unlike PCR's methods, extraction measures are unnecessary before inspection.
On April 7th, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on emergency usage authorization.
The test capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
The antibodies usually detected 14 days after the infection, early in April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody testing tools he bought were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong arranged for patients to be able to stay home, "the emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient," they spit it in, send it back, and get the results back later on, the NHS announced that the NHS were initiating the expected case scheme in the house to eliminate the risk of the patient passing anyone else if they came to the hospital or had to disinfect the ambulance if it was used. In exchange for the alleged COVID case of COVID-19, a professional health sample would be used.
The South Korean test center has helped do the fastest and widest testing of any country.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, a floor test was offered in several major cities.
Per March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
A lab survey first revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including the week 12 / 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.in Israel, the researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested the test of samples from 64 patients together, by just combining samples (6.9%)
With the construction being monitored by BGI Wang Jian's founder and the time it took 5 days, modelling showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine handling could be doubled if this testing capacity didn't exist.
Wuhan Laboratory is immediately followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total of 12 cities in China.
As per March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 daily tests per day, the open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as much as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks, this balanced design can be run in a small lab without needing a control of robotic fluid.
Until March, insufficient shortages and reactors have been a hindrance to mass testing in the European Union, Britain and the United States.
As such, a number of researchers attempted to explore the sample absorption protocol involving sample warming at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release the genome of RNA for further testing.
This was achieved through the combination of testing the floor and the purchase of mass-population labs from Group 42 and BGI (based on Huo-Yan's emergency detection lab in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab was able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and was the first to have this scale outside China.
The test recipes targeting various parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of testing tools sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop on their own.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Center was unavailable until January 28 to slow the tests available in the U.S., at the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States were troubled by the reliability of tests; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough testing tools to meet the demand and recommend medical experts' testing.
On the contrary, experts say that extensive testing availability in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing program as best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing because the spread of the vast virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait in the private lab of the US, and the supply of oil and chemical reagent to become critical.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem on their test kit.
In the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC has a "flaw"; the government later removed the bureaucratic impediment that prevents private testing, Spain bought a test tool from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the result was inaccurate.
The company explained that the result of the result may be a failure to collect samples or to use the test tool correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw the equipment that gave them the wrong result, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeation.80% of the tests that the Czech Republic from China bought would have been inaccurate, and Slovakia bought 1.2 million of the Chinese testing tools that turned out to be inaccurate.
The prime minister of Matovianism suggested that this test tool be thrown into the Danube River.
Testing, followed by a positive-tested quarantine of people and tracking people who are in contact with a positive SARS-CoV-2, giving positive results.
A researcher who worked in the city of Italian Vimanac, the first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, did two tests in the entire population of 3,400 people, within about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel to this community, new infections have been displaced altogether.
With aggressive tracking contacts, restriction of incoming travel, testing, and quarantine, a 2020 coravirus pandemic in Singapore developed much slower than any other advanced countries, even without extreme restrictions, like the forced closing of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay home on March 28th, but the schools reopened on time after the holidays on March 23.
Some other countries also handle pandemic by tracking aggressive contacts, restriction of incoming travel, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive quarantine areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study finds that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatality number, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
The WHO recommends that the first non-tested countries, and a national lab with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples of the first COVID-19 and ten negative samples into one of the 16 WHO references labs for confirmation testing.
Of 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive result of testing" column is affected by the testing policy of the country.
A country that only tests people in hospitals will have% of the positive results higher than a country that tests all the people, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing your hands, which is also called hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning the hands of someone who aims to remove the dirt, the oil, the microorganisms, or any other unwanted substance.
Washing your hand with soap consistently at a certain "critical moment" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal oral routes.
People can also catch respiratory diseases, such as influenza or selecosis, if they don't wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth (nasal membrane).
Five critical moments throughout the day are very important to wash hands with soap: before and after taking a dump, after cleaning the child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before feeding the child, before eating and before preparing food or processing the meat, fish, or the fowl raw.
If water and soap don't exist, hands can be washed with ashes.
Before, when, and after preparing the food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning kids who just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal excrement.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving you drugs or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The primary purpose of hand-washing is to clear the hands of pathogens or other microorganisms and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It's especially important for people who handle food or work in medicine, but it's also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including minimizing influenza, corona viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reduce the number of baby morality in childbirth at home.
The study done in 2013 shows that increasing hand-washing practices can be a little bit of a high-growth toddler.
In the developing world, children's mortalities due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple change in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the number of mortalities caused by the disease to nearly 50%.
A hand washing intervention can reduce the case of diarrhea to about a third of them; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of diarrhea can be associated with washing hands with soap; washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as subconscious behavior performed in houses, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the number one cause of child death; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diare and pneumonia led to the death of almost 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, washing your hands with soap before eating and using the toilet becomes a habit that saves more lives than vaccines or medical actions, and reduces death from diarrhea to almost half and death from the infection of the lungs to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other acts of sanitation as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene.
Washing hands also protect themselves from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small side effect of washing hands is that hand washing is often done that can cause skin damage from skin drying.
The study that was conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that self-washing can cause an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or handletitis, which is mainly the case among the health workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important for reducing the contagion of the disease sexually, namely: before using the toilet, after cleaning the child's ass, before feeding the child, before prepreparing the food or processing the meat, the fish, or the fowl raw.
Another important moment to apply the correct hand-washing techniques to prevent the contagion of disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing nose; after touching animal dung or handling animals; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that the average 38.7% home practice hand-washing with soap.
The baseline health care program that the Department of Education applied in the Philippines is an example of proper scaling actions to support child health and education.
The gift of worm medicine twice a year, coupled with washing your hands every day with soap and brushing your teeth every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
A microorganism purge of skin is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase the relaxation.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because fat and protein, which is organic dung components, not easily dissolved in water.
Despite that, fat cleaning and proteins are helped by enough water flow.
Solid soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that scrutinized the transfer of bacteria from solid soap were contaminated that the transfer was impossible because the bacteria were flustered with foam.
Even so, the CDC still states "liquid soap, which was released from the container without being touched by hands is preferred."
Anti-baskery soap is massively leveled on a health conscious society.
Until recently, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptic or disfectant is better recommended for organisms that are antibiotic-resistant in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains public antibaskery agents like the triklosan, which has a wide list of resistant organisms.
So, even if the antibacterial-resistant strain wasn't targeted by antibacterial soap, it might not be as effective as it is on the market.
In addition to surfactan and skin protection, sophisticated formulation can contain acid (acetate acid, ascorbate acid, lactic acid) as a pH, benzoic acid as an active anticlic acid, and further skin conditioner (Croc, vitamin, mentol, growth extract) .A comprehensive analysis of the Perforsive Health of the University of Oregon's population shows that common soap is as effective with consumer-based soap levels of trikoshasia, preventing the bacteria and the disease.
Warm, comfortable water to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
The warm sod water is more effective compared to the cold sod water in removing the natural oil that holds up the dung and bacteria.
However, contrary to the belief of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand-to-hand or antiseptic hand is a clean-up agent that's not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand sanitation agent was a non-water-based alcohol-scrubbing agent (also called alcohol-based hand-scrubbing, antiseptic hand scrubbing, or hand-molesting) began to be known.
Most of these janitorial agents are based on isopropium or ethanol-defined alcohol, along with stewards like Carbomer, into gel, or with humektan, such as glycerine, into fluid or foam to be used and to reduce the effect of drying out of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases more antimicroba activity, the hand abuse containing at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Hydrocotic abuse kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to a lot of MRSA, tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (include HlV, herpes, RRS, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
The abuse of alcohol containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to 35 decibels in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in hand 1 minute after use.
The alcohol-based torture of the hand is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause for contagious gastroenteritis.
The front and the back of two hands and the sidelines and the tips of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds until fluid, foam, or dried gel.
The tip of the finger should also be properly washed by rubbing it in two palms, the center of US Disease Control and Prevention suggest washing hands instead of rubbing hands, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increasing the use of torture agents because of the ease of use and rapid killing activities against microorganisms; yet, torture agents should not be used as a substitute for the right hand wash, unless soap and water is not available.
The abuse of alcohol-based hand abuse can often cause dry skin, unless the emolien and / or skin moisturizer is added to the formula.
The dry effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and / or other emoliens to the formula.
In clinical trials, the inebriated hand-abuse of alcohol causes irritation and skin drought to be much lower than soap and antichroba detergent.
Alergic contact dermatitis, urticaria contact syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hand-scrubbing alcohol is rare.
The lower tendency led to obstructive dermatitis of contact into the attraction of this product rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents don't cleanse hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still at hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand depends heavily on materials and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse-performing than alcohol and alcohol-scrubbing.
Recently, the formulation using benzachonium chloride proved to have constant and cumulative antimacrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which was proved reduced after repeated use, probably because of progressive side effects.
A lot of people in the low-income community can't afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the things that's worried about is, if it's contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash, it might increase the spread of disease rather than reducing it.
Like soap, the ash is also a desitative agent because, if contact with water, the ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique based on the U.S. Disease Control Center's recommendation for disease prevention includes the following measures:
Wet your hands with warm or cold flowing water.
The flowing water is recommended because the buried basin may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be indifferent.
Put your hands together and rub them with lots of soap, including the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more heavily when using soap instead of water.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Scrub creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rub longer to remove more germs.
Sterily rinse under the flowing water.
Lashing in the basin can get your hands contaminated again.
Dry it with a dry rag or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and damp hands are easier to contaminate, and the area they often pass off is thumbs, wrists, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Parsed nails and nail polish can store microorganisms.
The moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of contagion.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate washing your hands when tap water and / or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from the jerry or bottles that are hung and shredded and / or used to ash, if necessary, in the developing world. In situations where the water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "typpy-tap," as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology using a water bottle hung with a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there's a debate about the most effective hand drying forms in public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper laps are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European paper lap industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleanliness rate of paper laps, warm air dryers, and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, total amounts of bacteria were found to increase an average of 194% in knuckles and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Dried with jet air dryers caused a total increase in bacteria average of 42% in knuckles and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying with paper laps, the total number of bacteria is reduced to 76% average in the knuckles and 77% in the palm of the hand. Scientists are also testing to determine the potential cross-contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of drying method.
The jet's air dryer, which blows the air out of the unit at a claimed speed of 180 meters / s (650 km / hours; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms out of hand and unit and potentially contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Papers did not show significant spread of microorganisms.
After the drying of the hand, the number of bacteria observed changes:
There are many manufacturing hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper laps.
Washing your hands with hand-wrappers is an alternative to traveling if there's no soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand torture must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand laundering was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospitals.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the infection rate is decreasing with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, by using a large amount of soap and water or gel to comb and rub every part of the hand.
Hands should rub against each other with their fingers intertwined.
If there's dirt under the nails, the fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water that is in hand, hands need to be rinsed with a stub and drained with clean laps.
Once dry, paper laps are used to turn off the tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids the recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The goal of washing hands in the health care order is to eliminate the pathogen microorganisms and avoid the contagion.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching the patient so it infects microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can reduce the infection rate of blood flow to 66 percent, the World Health Organization has published a sheet that shows the standard of wash hands and rub hands in the health care sector.
The concept of the WHO hand sanitation can also be seen on his website for public comments.
The relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance is necessary.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash their hands:
After exposure to blood / bodily fluids
before the acettic task, and
After patient care, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap, or antiticambroba, works to kill hand-washing chemicals.
The kill function may be desired before surgery or in a situation when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. For "rub 'hands before surgery, it takes a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidin wash or yodium, sterile lap to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure requires hand washing and forearm to elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
The old scrubbing time (10 minutes) is unnecessary.
When rinsed, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing your hands, your hands were drained with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it's better to wash your hands or use hand abuse before and after handling the sick.
For the control of the stafilocokus infection at the hospital, it was discovered that the greatest benefits of cleaning hands were from the first 20% of the washing, and that the added benefits were very little when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35%.
Awash with regular soap is more than triple the contagion of infection to food rather than washing with antibacterial soap; the comparison between rubbing your hands with alcohol-based solution and washing your hands with antibacterial soap at 30 seconds each show that the alcohol-based hand scrubbing reduces 26 percent more bacteria contamination than antibacterial soap.
However, the soap and water are more effective than the alcohol-based hand-scrubbing virus to reduce alcohol-based influenza a H1N1 virus and the Clostridium diffile spores from the hands.
It takes more research to know the most effective intervention in various health care settings.
In the developing world, washing hands with soap is recognized as a fundamental way of saving costs to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or a washing facility at the residents' homes, schools, and workplaces make targets to reach universal wash behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washes near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, despite the options for making cheap hand washes.
However, low levels of hand wash can also happen because of a habit that has been embedded and not because of lack of soap or water.
Soap-washing urges can affect policy decisions, increase awareness about the benefits of washing, and produce long-term population behavior changes.
To walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
The systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns are less effective, one example of the school's "Three-Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to make sure students wash their hands with soap, among other sanitary requirements.
When the minimum standard is achieved, the school can move from one star to the end to three stars.
Building a washroom could be part of a hand-washing campaign that's done to reduce child disease and death.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of a campaign of awareness trying to achieve the goal of behavioral change, due to the corona virus 2019-2020, UNICEF is doing hand-washing emoji.
Some studies study the effectiveness of hand-washing costs in the developing world in relation to the disabilities of Life-associated Life Year or the size of the year that was lost in pain.
One review shows that washing hand-washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
It was a wash of hands for human health, especially for people in a vulnerable state, like a mother who had a baby or a wounded soldier in a hospital, first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of clean hands: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern care in England.
At the time, many still believe that infection was caused by a foul smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the outbreak that was transmitted through food and infection related to health care made the United States Disease Control Center more actively inciting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries would be essential to washing hands with soap to protect itself from the infectious disease.
For example, the "true hand-washing techniques" poster hung next to the sink in the public bathroom as well as the toilet office and airport in Germany.
The phrase "wash my hands" means something about someone's aversion to being responsible for something or getting involved in something.
The phrase was from the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it was a phrase widely used in the British community.
In Shakespeare, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to cleanse her imaginary stain; an act that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for trying to persuade her husband to do so.
Also it has been known that, after remembering or contemplating unethical acts, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand-washing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after the contemplation have a smaller chance of being involved in a clean-up act of compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion orders hand-washing and symbolising purposes; symbolic hand laundering, which use water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of ritual washing in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu, test and netilatal yadayim in the Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu. The religion also commands the wash of hands for cleanliness, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jews, and Islam require that you wash your hands after using the toilet.
Moreover, Hindu religion, Buddha, Sikh, Jew, and Islam requires hand-washing before and after eating.
Containment control of the workhouse for COVID-19
The danger control of the workplace for COVID-19 is the application of both safety and health methods for danger control for the 2019 coronavirus prevention (COVID-19).
The proper control of danger at work depends on job locations and job duties, based on risk assessment of exposure, disease severity in society, and risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Health and Health Administration (OSHA), risky jobs of low exposure have minimal contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, it is recommended basic infection prevention measures, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and doing clean and disinfect the environment of work regularly.
Risk job exposure is covering a job that requires close contact or often with an unknown person or suspected suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing contagion in the community or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public like in school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume retail order.
The danger control for this group, other than the basic infection prevention measures, covers the vents using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection when it comes to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and mortuary exposed to people known or suspected of suffering from COVID-19 high-risk exposure, which increases to high exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or taking or handling specimens from, known or suspected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate control of danger for this worker includes engineering control, such as negative pressurized ventilation space, and self-defense tools that fit the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact at work.
Workers may not come to work because they're sick, need to take care of others, or fear exposure.
Trade patterns can change, either in terms of the requested or the way to get these items (such as shopping outside rush hour, through delivery, or on the floor).
Finally, the shipment of goods from the geographical region which is highly impacted by COVID-19 can be compromised, prepared and planned for counterinfection to be used to guide protective measures.
Plans consider risk rates associated with various workspaces and jobs, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise from house order and community, as well as risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Plans also decipher the control necessary to overcome those risks and the emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The readiness and plan for the treatment of infectious diseases may be subject to national recommendations or subnational.
The purpose of counter-outbreak includes reducing the contagion among the staff, protecting those who risk higher for worse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing bad effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where business is being affected by the countermeasures taken.
The hierarchy of danger control is a framework that's used a lot in safety and health to classify danger control based on its effectiveness.
If the danger of the COVID-19 is irrevocable, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last tool of self-preservation.
Technical control includes insulating employees from occupational harm without relying on labor behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to apply.
Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that require a worker or a worker's action.
Self-preservation is considered less effective than management and administrative, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All kinds of APD must be chosen based on the dangers of the workers, installed correctly as they are (for example, respiretors), imposed consistently and correctly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and released, and cleaned, and stored properly or dumped to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), risky jobs of low exposure have minimal employment contact with the public and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include often washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if ill, respiratory ethic covers cough and sneeze, providing tissue and garbage, preparing long-range jobs or incremental workspaces, if necessary, telling workers not to use tools and equipment of other people, and doing environmental cleaning and disinfection of work regularly.
The quick identification and isolation of individuals who potentially infect is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and other people at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should stay at home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using any fever medication or any other symptom medication, and in order for the hospital leave policy to be flexible, allowing employees to live in homes to care for sick family members, and so that employees know about this policy.
According to OSHA, a risky job of exposure is covering a job that requires close contact or often within six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown person or suspected suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to exposure around the business location, or because someone recently traveled international to a location with a vast CoVID-19 contagion.
This group includes workers with high-population contacts such as in school, high-population-density environments, and high-volume retail settings.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If one falls ill in an airplane, the proper control to protect the workers and the other passengers includes separating the sick from the others by six feet away, pointing out one of the cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering facial masks to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue while coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and perhaps other self-defense devices if passengers have fever, cough constantly, or trouble breathing.
Glove and other disposable goods must be thrown in the bag of biohazard and contaminated surfaces must be cleansed and disinfected afterwards.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabin of an isolated person, regardless of the spread in society, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there's a contagion in society at a minimum to the medium, social limitation strategies can be applied, which includes: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, show choir class, or eat in the cafeteria, increase the distance between the table, time of incremental arrivals, limit separate health visits for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high contagion in the local community, besides social limitation strategies, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who conduct daily activities, health risks are immediately considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or expected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-defense devices.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, workers will have to clear and disinfect the belt and task equipment before being used again by using a spray or a cleaning rag and following standard operating procedures to control and dispose of an old apd as well as to control and wash the dirty clothes.
OSHA considers both health and mortuary services to be in the high risk category of exposure or extremely high.
Risk work exposure includes giving health care, support, labs, and medical transportation personnel exposed to patients known or suspected COVID-19.
This job becomes at great risk of exposure if the workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, patients known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol production includes intubation, cough induction procedure, broncoscopy, multiple procedures and dental checks, or invasive specimen retrieval.
The mortuary work is at risk of high exposure, including the workers involved in preparing for the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this job is at risk of exposure very high if the workers perform autopsy.
Ventilation of special negative pressure may suit in some health care order and mortuary.
Specimen must be dealt with with as a precaution for Biological Level 3 Safety Level.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come apart into different waiting rooms based on if they're suspected of COVID-19 cases.
In the United States, the N95 filter face-mask respiration approved by NIOSH or better to be used in context of written and comprehensive respiratory protection programs that include a test of conformity, training, and medical examination.
The other type of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the workforce's comfort.
WHO just recommended surgical masks for the screening officer at the entry point.
For people who take respiratory specimens, care, or transport patients COVID-19 without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedures are performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the APD supply is inadequate around the world, the WHO recommends minimizing the needs of APD through long-range medical services, physical barriers like invisible windows, with only people involved in immediate care may enter a room with COVID-19 patients, using only specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirators without taking them off while treating many patients with similar diagnostics, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chains, and not pushing masks to use masks for people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare the future
DEFENSE / TIME DRIVER: March 14, 2020, 00: 24 UTC
LISENTION: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes it clear that the global human connection and responsibility that we have to each other.
We've never experienced a challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all colleagues through email, call, and chat are extraordinary human validation, which we are fortunate enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride can call you all partners.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how much it represents this powerful resource to remain online for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, help pay for our colleagues, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially right now.
This is a moment when not only is the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the thing that we thought was an appropriate response to the challenges that we face and the best way to maintain organizational survival during this period.
We really want to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long haul.
If you need to cut the work schedule, that's fine.
To all the staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work hopes are about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, shop basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It's not supposed to be said, but we're saying it.
Leave the pain or the PTO is not necessary, just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to make sure the main workspaces can be resolved.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan inside the T & C Ops so that T & C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the proper attention of management).
Friends whose hours-based wages will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we've said it once again, to honor our commitment to our co-contractors and watch-based staff.
Everyone gets paid based on their normal hours when things get normal.
It's included if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
A lot of people use jobs as a way of channeling stress against the world around us.
The work we do can be very gratifying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work that needs to keep going.
SRE, Operation SDM, Trust & Security, as well as the Dana Refund Team, in between, doing important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess our current goals and divert our focus to support the essential thing for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slow the present down will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan on working overtime catching up after this pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet an unrealistic deadline today.
We realize that the situation is changing and will attempt to set a target and a new timeline if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to new realities and expectations of the day shift, we intend to adjust the timeline for the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our point is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make the budget so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care care for loved ones while accommodating those who need to or want to work on fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This time line experience is extremely reducing the workload and the pressure of planning right now throughout the organization.
We'll submit our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegates and the team at the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership on this.
Status, exposure, and clean office
Last week, we were told that one of our colleagues based at SF might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, because we were so worried, we hired an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used anti-virus fluid with hospitals to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building is implementing its own safety protocol by using a product that supports the life of its tenant.
We were glad that the office would be ready to wear when we decided to come back.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all of the staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a full-distance workstation, along with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our friends who are based in NYC, we're also discussing about renting a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues realize that it might need an adjustment and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting for at least an hour or two.
If further sessions are required, consider how to divide them into a few days.
Define the meeting clearly, create an agenda, and send previous reading material.
Make the video default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and immediate connections.
Leading leaders to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chatter for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting record (or make a collaborative record).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy a small meal.
Join the # remoties channel in Slack to talk to a colleague about the work he shared
The Human Resources Team is looking for a Webinar-based ergonomi guidelines to support the increase of jobs distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grant donors to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic over.
We tell them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions can make them impossible to complete the approved grant activity and that no one will be given a penalty for having to delay or modify the target.
Next week we'll follow up with additional guidelines about Wikimania and regional community conferences and other economies.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be a sadness caused by this disorder, but also a relief to clarity and the ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Go ahead, CRT is trying to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 2: 00 UTC / 7: 00 p.m. for a special staff meeting.
We're going to use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can keep getting information from this email and all the essential information related to the other COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is in one place.
We're also trying to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries that are currently significantly impacted.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflow, or difficulty about coverage, or anything else that might need help, feel free to tell and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become the necessary liaison.
If you have any secret or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Operation Global SDM International.
Let none of these changes be seen as the neglect of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, this change is a confession that, at this point, our jobs and obligations may need to be adapted in ways that we've never done before.
These changes are the steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement needs, and give the world the services that they rely on.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create a space for the important work to come in a few weeks and maybe the next few months.
We need all of you to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work well when you need to.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT, (Amanda K, Amy V, Amy J, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and other Tony S), and members of the other leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'enzyme changer angiosin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outside surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestine.
Ace2 has counter-activity with the angiosin (ACE) version enzyme, by reducing the number of angiossin-II and enhancing Angianzelensin (1-7), thereby making it the target of a drug that promises to treat cardiovascular disease. Ace2 also acts as an entry point to cells for some coronavirus.
Human-version Aceys are often referred to as HACE2.
The inversion enzyme of angiosin 2 is a metalloenzyme containing zinc that lies on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The Ace2 protein has an M2 peptidase terminal-N domain and the transporter domain of amino renal collectrin terminal-C acid.
Ace2 is a single type I-jumping membrane protein, with an enzimatic active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissue.
The Ace2 extractive domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
Ace2 is in most of the organs: Ace2 is attached to the membrane of the cell particularly the alveolar cell of a type Il lung, the enterocyte of the small intestine, the entropy cells of arteries and veins, and the smooth muscle cells of arteries in most of the organs.
The mRNA Ace2 expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The ACE2 primary function is as an ACE counterweight.
ACE splits the angiosin hormones I into angiosin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, Ace2 cut amino acid from carboxine terminal from angikossin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and synthesized it into angiosin (1-7).
Ace2 can also split a number of other peptide covers [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurolaxin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
Ace2 also regulates neutral amino transporter traffic SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, Ace2 acts as a major entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-Cov (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein binding on the spike or the SARS-CoV bulge and SARS-CoV2 with the enzimatic domain Ace2 on the surface of the cell resulting in endositosis and viral translocation and enzyme into the endosome that lies within the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires a primary S protein by the TMPRSS2 protein serase host, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy, which allows people to hypothesize that the decrease in the Ace2 levels in the cell may be able to help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory agencies recommend continuing the ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of the ACE inhibitors led to a significant decrease of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "ACE inhibitors use also lower the risk of pneumonia on patients who have higher risks for pneumonia, especially patients with strokes and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the decline of pneumonia-related morality, although the results are less powerful than the risk of a whole pneumonia. "
Human recominators are expected to be new therapies for acute lung injuries, and appear to be increasing pulmonary hyemodynamics and the saturation of oxygen in piglets with acute breath syndrome induced by lipoplisacaridary.
Part time in human being is about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work in addition to the length of the 24-hour duration.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a drug that promises to patients with intolerance to the renin-angioidsin system (classic inhibitors) or the disease with angiosine II in increased blood circulation.
b 'CoVID-19 application is a cellular software application designed to help track contacts to tackle the coronavirus 2019-2020, which is a process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have made contact with the infected person.
Many applications developed or proposed, which got official government support in some areas and jurisdiction.
Some framework for building contact tracking applications has been developed.
The issue of privacy is questioned, particularly related to a system based on tracking the application's geographic location.
Alternate that doesn't really infiltrate privacy covers the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread an app that allows people to check if they've been in contact with CoVID-19.
This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it's used in an app called TraceTokyo.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be turned over to the government; North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!," a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to people who are potentially infected and give immediate response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, it was still awaiting Google Play Store approval and Apple App Store.
On April 12th, the government stated that the contact tracking app was in the advanced development stage and will be available to deploy in a few weeks -- similar applications planned in Ireland and in France.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore TraceTohasia applications and BlueTrace protocols. The Russians want to introduce geofencing applications for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; they're designed to make sure they don't leave the house.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might occur in application-based systems, which include false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken by applications is limited to a fraction of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of "coronavirus" application misleading or dangerous, Apple sets a limit on the type of organization that can add coronavirus related applications to App Store, which is limiting only to "official" organizations or those with good reputations.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
The privacy advocates their concerns about the implication of mass surveillance using a coronavirus app, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure that was created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be terminated once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limitations on surveillance of this kind.
This organization states eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "legal, necessary, and proportionate";
expand monitoring and surveillance must have sunsets;
data usage must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
Security and anonymity of data must be protected and proved protected based on evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid getting worse discrimination and marginalization;
each division of data with a third party must be defined in laws;
There must be protection against abuse and right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The participation means that all of my "relevant interests" are necessary, which includes community health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google / Apple plan intended to address the issue of surveillance constantly by removing the tracking mechanism of the device operating system after it was no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and instead of applications, thereby removing the required download of applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access the personal location data; a number of systems protecting privacy have been created and using the central server only for intercommunication (see the bottom).
In South Korea, an app-based system is used to do contact tracking.
Instead of using a special application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including data tracking mobile devices and data trading cards, and combining this information to produce a notification through text messages to people who are potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made that location information available to the public, something that is allowed to have extensive changes to information privacy laws after creating MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Tracking private contacts is an established concept, with a huge amount of research literature starting from at least 20133 on April 7th, 2020, more than a dozen experts working on private friendly solutions, such as using Low Energy Bluetooth, to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains centralized and decentralized approaches, and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Center Tracking for Cellular Contacts (DP-PPT / DP-3T), the TempN Number (TCN, previously called the Genesis Number, CEN), Protocol and Sensitive Personality Registration for Cellular Contacts (PACT) and others.
In this protocol, identified personal data never leaves a device, and all matching occurs on the device.
Privacy groups at MlT Media Lab developed SafePaths, platforms to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data plot to track the spread of COVID-19.
It's based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: the Matinagine Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort was the LifeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share locations and health data sensitive to other users and officers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had essentially the same approach and were overlapping protocols, in order to reduce the fragmentation and allow global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which were the main aspect to achieve extensive admissions.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had created the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application to be an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android cell platforms and iOS, announced the initiative for tracking contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also release the specs of the core technology used in that system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to launch in three stages:
A launch tool to allow the government to create an official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy.
The integration of this function directly onto the iOS and Google Android and Apple are planning to address the problem of data retrieval and surveillance continuously as it originally distributes the system through the update of the operating system, and then remove it in the same way after the threat passes.
b'Reposition of medicine (also referred to a new purpose, new profile, or a new task in medicine or transition therapy) is a drug that has been approved for new treatment purposes, which is for different diseases or medical conditions with the purpose of early development of medicine.
This path is a scientific research path that is currently being conducted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
The other direction of research includes the development of the CoVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfusion convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targets of drugs, each protein has some ligan binding sites.
Analysis of these ligan binding sites could be the basis of an effective anti-virus drug development project on COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are similar to paper, RNA polymerase depends-RNA, helicase, S proteins, and ADP riboshaffatase.
Hussein A A, et research some of the candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed his common resemblance with approved drugs and had the highest penchant for accelerating the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in their practical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalaria drug that's also used against some autoimmune diseases.

This treatment has not yet been approved by FDA clinical trials and is authorized by EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use of patients who are sleeping, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydrochlorocuine for profiling or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not been set.
The doctor said they used the drug when "no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a little study on chlorocuine use combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
The great study is underway at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a security test and efficacy use of hydrochlorocuin preventive use.
The clinical tests in China in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir is "clearly effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in median four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days at 45 who did not receive the drug.

A study of lopinavir, a combination of lopinavir antivirus and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed."
This drug was designed to impede HlV replication by binding proteins.
A research team at the University of Colorado are trying to modify a drug to find a compound that will bond with the SARS-CoV-2.There are critics in the scientific community about repositioning the drugs that are developed specifically for HlV / AlDS.
WHO inserted lopinavir / ritonavir in the international solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is that resistance can occur through mutations that can lead to worse diseases and transmissions.
Some of the early predural studies show that the remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and there are some clinical trials that are ongoing, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, which is one for people with mental illness and another for people who are seriously ill.
There are three clinical trials going on for intravenous vitamin C for people who are treated and sick with severe COVID-19, which is two controlled placebo (China, Canada) and one without control.

Some of the antibiotics identified potentially as a drug that could be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, tryouts are also done in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab # COVID-19.
b'Vaccine COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus.
Although no vaccine has yet completed the clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop that vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the security study of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 identified in December 2019.
The great epidemic spread around the world in 2020, resulting in huge investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that might be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the thing that needs to be noticed in developing a vaccine is speed, production capacity, deployment on the scale that it needs, and global access.
In April, the CEPI lmuwan reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during the early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Main platform target advancing to Phase I security study, covering:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As the CEPI scientist reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed active projects (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with less public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials do early security and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, while determining a more precise effective dose.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of 79 active vaccine candidates being developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of which are not yet in human evaluations (still in "practinist" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.

On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they were working on 11 insulate, and even on the fast track, vaccine development at least took about a year and a half to two.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The candidate for this vaccine is in lab research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, had offered a huge amount of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company, BioNTech, to together develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the candidate vaccine based on mRNA, BNT162, is in the practitical testing with clinical trials estimated to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive the results of the culinary testing in April 2020 and the vaccine candidates in the final stages could begin to be tested on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidema Prevention Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US $4.9 million in consortium vaccine research of COVID-19 that involved the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and University of Pittsburgh, with a total CEVI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Another cepi investment partner for the development of the covID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six candidate vaccines on animals.
Imperial College researcher London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could implement itself for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving sequens from China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced funds for C $275 million for 96 medical treatment projects against COVID-19, covering a number of vaccine candidates in companies and Canadian universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiative.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund of C $192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak happened.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh medical department reported testing PittCoVac, candidates for the covID-19 vaccine, in the mice; they stated that "MNA" who gave the subunits S1 S1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine raises a specific antigen response that was photographed [on the mice] which began to look two weeks after immunization. "
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the faculty of Waterloo University Pharmaceuticals announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
By using bacteriophag, DNA was designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless-like particles, which could stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 viruses.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with the computing resources of clouds from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologist effect, which is also called nonspecific effects.
And that means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease that they're withholding.
Further random tests in Australia are attempting to include 4.170 medical personnel.
There's a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies of vaccine value using covID-19 specific animal models, such as acE2-transgenic mice, other lab animals, and nonhuman primates, show the need for the impediment measures to reach the level of biological safety in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on nonhuman animal models.
Until 2020, there was no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicine to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, existing SARS research was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against the MARS-Cov infection.
In March 2020, there was one MES vaccine that completed the clinical phase I in humans, and three other vaccines were in process, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two vector adenovirus (ChAOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MVA-MERS (MVA-S).
Social media posted a conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind the COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
Patents that are quoted by various social media posts refer to patents that exist for genetic sequencers and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, like SARS coronavirus coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
General symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time since exposure to symptoms are at most about five days, but it can go from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop to be viral pneumonia and compound organ failure.
Until April 17th, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, which result in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured.
Although produced while breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious for the first three days after the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the disease stage, and after the next stage of the disease, the standard diagnosis method is with a reaction of polymerase transcription back real-time (rRT-PCR) on the napofaring sap.
Masks are recommended for people who are suspected to be exposed to the virus and people who are taking care of it.
Recommendations about the use of masks by the general public; some authorities recommend not using masks, some of which recommend their use, and others require their use.
At the moment, there is no vaccine or antivirus specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People who are infected with viruses can be without symptoms or experience symptoms like flu, like fever, cough, fatigue, and asphyxiation.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, pain or constant chest distress, confusion, difficulty of waking up, and face or bluish lips; medical treatment is immediately advised if these symptoms appear.
The upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snot, or sore throat can be found, but more rare.
Gestrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in various percentage.
Some cases in China were originally just clinical images of chest contusions and palpitations.
In some people, disease can evolve into pneumonia, failure of compound organs, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can ranges from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the people who have the symptoms will suffer in 11.5 days of infection, and reports show that not all of the infected are suffering from symptoms.
The carrier role without these symptoms in the contagion is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Today, the proportion of infected people who are showing no unknown symptoms and are being examined, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during treatment.
The China National Health Commission began to include a case without symptoms in its daily case on April 1st; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms during testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a load of viruses on a large scale.
Talking loudly releases more spark or droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that wasn't covered could cause droplets to be driven up to four and a half feet (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted by air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collectors placed in the halls outside people's rooms produce a positive sample for the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation, can turn the respiratory sequence into aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that viruses can spread through feses, these risks are believed to be low.
The European Disease Control and Prevention Center says that even though it's not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person generally infects two to three other people, it can survive on the surface for hours and days.
Specifically, the virus can be detected for a day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic and corrosive steel, and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent also effective if used correctly; soap products decipher the protective layer of the virus, activating the virus, as well as releasing it from other skin and surfaces.
Another barrel, like benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin glukonat, is less effective in a study in Hong Kong, a saliva sample taken in median two days after the treatment began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample shows the highest load of the virus, and the sixth patient shows the highest load of the virus on the second day test.
The coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the case of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus traits are in natural coronavirus.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by household soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
Parts are the most affected organs by the COVID-19 because the virus accessed the stem cells through the miniature enzyme of the Angionsin 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar type Il pulmonary cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or bulge" to connect to the Ace2 and enter the host cell.
An acute heart injury was found at 12% of the infected who were treated in Wuhan, China, and more frequently in severe diseases.
The levels of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systematic inflammatory response and immune systems disorder during disease development, but acute miocards injury may also be related to the Ace2 receptors in the heart.
The Ace2 receptor is expressed very high at heart and engaged in cardiac functions.
The high venous thrombosis incident (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) was found in the covID-19 infection patient in ICU and may be associated with bad prognosis. Autopsy on the deceased because COVID-19 found alveolar difus (DAD) damage and infilttate infomosite containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cell that expresses ACE2, heavy COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
Specifically, the GM-CSF combinatorial T cells are proven to correlate with monocyte recruitment that recretes IL-6 inflammatories and severe pulmonary pathology on patient COVID-19.
The lymphate infiltrat was also reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has released some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction transcription back real-time (RT-PCR).
These tests are usually done in respiratory samples that are obtained through naguofaring sashes; but, nasal or sputum samples can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two samples of blood taken at a distance of two weeks so the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate these coronavirus strains and unify its genetic sequencers so that labs around the world could develop the testing of the polymerase chain reaction independent to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, the antibody test (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) was in development, but it hasn't been much use.
Chinese experience with that test shows that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
Field-glass opacity multilobar bilateral with peripheral distribution, asymmetric, and posterior was found a lot earlier in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidating can occur as disease progresses.
Little data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiology.
The primary pathological findings of the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleunutrition, pericharditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of pneumonia virus can be observed:
lightweight pneumonia: edema pulmoner, hyperplasia pneumonia, large-range pneumonia, inflammatory inflammatory with multiple nucleic infiltration, and the formation of core giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: alveolar difus (DAD) damage with alveolar ecsudat difus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome and heavy hypochmia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: the exudat array in the alveolar cavity and fibrosis interstitial pulmonary
Blood: intravascular coagulation disinata (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Prevention measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practising good breathing higiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you close your mouth and nose with a tissue when you're coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the elbow inside if you're not available.
Higiene's hands are appropriate after coughing or sneezing are recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of the mask from the fabric in public, partly to limit the contagion of people without symptoms, a social limitation strategy intended to reduce the contact of infected people with many, by shutting down schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restrictions also include people keeping their distance at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
No known drug has effectively prevented the COVID-19.Since the anticipated vaccine hadn't existed until early 2021, the main part of handling COVID-19 was trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flatten the curve."
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coming out of the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, as well as having eaten nose, coughing, or sneezing.
More CDC also recommends using alcohol-based insulation which contains at least 60% of the alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand abuse is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, animicry activity comes from ethanol or isopopanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove the bacteria spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for the antisepsis of the hand."
Glyserol added as humektan.
People are dealt with with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommended someone who thought they were carrying a virus to wear a simple face mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane has been used to address respiratory failure issues, but its benefits are still being considered.
Cleanliness and lifestyle and healthy diet are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportory care may be useful to people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.
intensive care experts and pulmonary experts in the United States have put together a recommendation for treatment from various institutions to free resources, the IDCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetaminopen more than ibuprofen for the use of the first line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral contagion, especially in health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand vents.
For health care patients of CoVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the individual in the Tular-Air Infection Injection Room (AIIR) instead of using standard precautions, contact precautions, and direct air prevention.
Recommended equipment is: a robe of APD, a respirator or a mask, an eye mask, and a medical glove.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used under Emergency Use authorization (EUA).
The N95 respirator was designed to protect it from air-built particles like dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unmentioned use in labels.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends to use facial armor or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most cases of the COVID-19 aren't so heavy that it needs mechanical or alternative vents, but some of them are.
The type of respiratory support for people who have failed breathing related to COVID-19 is actively being investigated for people who are staying in, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal canulas or bipositive air strains.
It is not yet known whether one of these two methods produces the same benefits for people who are in critical pain.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical vents, if available, because they limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow-based canulas, heavy cases occur in older people over 60, and especially people over 80.
Many developed countries don't have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limit the health system capacity to deal with a sudden spike in the case of the COVID-19 which is bad enough that it requires immediate residency.
A study in China found that 5% entered the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of the treatment of covID-19 eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation became more complex as acute breath syndrome occurred on COVID-19 and oxygen became increasingly difficult.
A ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP required to maximize the shipment of oxygen at the same time minimizes the risk of lung injury and pneumonia related ventilators.
The high PEEP may not be available on the old ventilator.
The research on the potential treatment began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of a new drug may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tested on people with severe disease.
Volunteers recommended WHO participated in the test of effectiveness and security of potential medicine. The FDA has given temporary authorization for plasm conservalent as an experimental care in the case of one's life very or is suddenly threatened.
Plasma convalescent has not yet undergone the clinical study necessary to prove its security and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a cellular app to deal with this epidemic.
The user is asked to enter their name and ID numbers.
This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-contained quarantine, but also tells local health workers, analytics are on mobile data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security services to trace the cell phone of the person suspected to be infected with coronavirus.
That step was taken to impose quarantine and protect anyone who might be in contact with an infected citizen.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared a phone location aggregate to a German federal agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to examine and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera, said he was told by a mobile operator that "40% of citizens are still moving around."
The German government is doing hackatons on a 48-hour weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Moreover, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can experience quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor, who says, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decadence is the perfect storm that endangers mental health and well-being."
It can go lightly with less or without symptoms, which resembles other common upper breath diseases, like a cold.
Light cases usually heal in two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have higher risks for a CoVID-19 infection heavy based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking.
In the most severely impacted person, the COVID-19 can rapidly evolve into acute breath syndrome which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and liver damage.
Blood clotting disorder, particularly the increase in prodrombin time, observed at 6% of the covID-19 patients who are sleeping, while kidney dysfunction is seen at 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 description indicate an increase in the liver enzyme.
According to the same report, the median time between the symptoms and death is ten days, by five days spent in inpatient care.
However, the patient transferred to ICU has seven days median between inpatient and death.
In a study that studies early cases, medians start from early symptoms to early death are 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the China National Health Commission, men have a 2.8% mortality rate, while women have a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Hypopatalogical sample of postmortem lung shows alveolar difus damage with cellular fibroksoid ecurns in both lungs.
The cythopathic changes of the virus are observed on pneumonia.
The lung image resembles acute breath syndrome.
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March's data from the United States, 89% of the people who've been treated have built-in conditions. The available medical and economic resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimated mortalities of varied conditions are due to the differences of the region, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The lack of a mild case count can cause death rates to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is a result of cases that took place in the past can mean that today's moral numbers are too low.
Smokers have 1.4 times as many symptoms of a severe COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death than any non-smoker, and there are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20% loss of lung capacity to 30% on some people recovering from disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause pascasecare-intensive syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it was unknown that previous infections gave effective and long-term immunity to people who were cured of this disease.
The immunities seen may be obtained, given other coronavirus behavior, but have been reported to be a case of a recovery of COVID-19 followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a permanent infection that is deteriorating, and not a reinfection.
The virus is suspected natural and comes from animals, through the spreading infection.
The true origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by the contagion of man to man.
A study of 41 confirmed COVID-19 first, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the first Asian symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official publication of the WHO reported the earliest assences on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate morality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, the handling options, the time from the first outbreak, and the character of the population like age, gender, and health overall.
At the end of 2019, the WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code for U07.1 for death due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection which confirmed the lab and U07.2 for the death of a clinical COVID-19 or epidemiological without the confirmation of the lab for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death to the case globally is 6.9% (153.822 / 2,240.191) by 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. The other measure includes the number of cases (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed with certain diseases, and the number of fatalities that reflect the percentage of the infected (the infected) that are diagnosed with disease.
These statistics are not bound in time and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who's infected makes antibodies, the existence of antibodies can give information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epidemic epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 civilians, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
In Gangelt, the disease is distributed through the Carnival Festival, which spreads among the young, causing relatively lower morality, and possibly not all death of COVID-19 is classified as the death of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In Holland, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as tested by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of population) were confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
It's a pandemic impact and a different level of morality for men and women.
Higher morality in men in studies performed in China and Italy.
The highest risk for a man is in his 50s, with a risk difference between a new man and a new woman not visible at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for a man is 2.8 percent, and for a woman is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for differences based on this gender is unknown, but the genetic factor and behavior may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men who have a commanbide state, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher morality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of the people who died because COVID-19 was men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government didn't track the gender-related data for the COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that viruses, like Ebola, HlV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of the health care workers with higher gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19."
The leader of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time ever identified outbreak: December 31, 2019.
The name was selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (for example China), animal species, or a group of people, in accordance with international recommendations for naming to prevent stigmatization. A virus that caused the COVID-19 to be named the heavy-respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Neither disease nor viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "the Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and breath disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to 2015 guidelines that compelled it not to use the name of the location in the name of the disease and the virus.
Official CoVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers are printing health care materials like the nasal and ventilator components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital desperately needs a ventilator valve, and the supplier cannot provide on the required time scale, a local engineering company and printing the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the early outbreak of the COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information, and dissociation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and aspects of other diseases, which quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccine and drug COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effects of four promising antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines aren't available yet, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-Cov was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were both using the Ace2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinations being investigated.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine whole.
The use of the virus, whether it's dormant or dead, is to quickly trigger a human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunite vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes immune systems sensitive to certain subs in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the S-spike protein that helped the virus infiltrate the Ace2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine.
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. The anti-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials going on in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluating approved treatments for malaria, covering four studies of hydrochloricuine or chlorocuine hydrochlorine.
The new-intended antivirus drug forms most of Chinese research, with nine phase-III trials on redesivir in some countries with a deadline reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and the COVID-19 cure exists. Some of the existing antivirus drugs are evaluated for the COVID-19 treatment, which includes the clavicle, chlorocuine and hydrochloriovir, lopinavir / ritonavir, and vinavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the efficacy of the Remdesivir.
Clinical enhancement is observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency medicine.
Clinical tests of Phase III are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy, the chlorocuine, which was previously used to treat malaria, studied in China in February 2020, with an initial result.
However, there was a call for a personal review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommends the use of chlorocuine.
However, the Wuhan Virological Institute, despite recommending a single gram of daily doses, noted that a double dose is dangerous and lethal.
On March 28th, 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorization for hydrochloriklorocuine and chlorocuine use for doctors who took care of COVID-19.China's 7th edition also included interferon, ribavirin, or umienoprold to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data suggests that a high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for more in vivo studies after showing further containment of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration. Research shows that early priming against protein bump by transmembrane protections serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical to entry SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorocuine and hydrochloricuine with or without the azitromycin has great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research.
The compound of cytokin storms can occur on the COVID-19 heavy stages further.
There is evidence that the hydrochlorocuine may have anticytokin. the Tocilizumab has been put in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small research has been completed.
This drug is undergoing a nonrandom phase 2 test at a national level in Italy after showing positive results on people with severe disease.
Combined with the blood test of the pheritine serum to identify the cytokin storm, this drug is meant to fight the cytokin storm, which is thought to be the cause of death on some affected people.
In 2017, the antagonist receptor interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of cytokinic release syndrome induced by different causes, which is CAR T. cell therapy.
Until recently, there has been no random and controlled evidence that suggests that tocilizumab is a effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring antibodies that are purified and glued together by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it being examined as the passive immunization method of nonvaccine.
This strategy was tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
The neutralization of the virus is a working mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytoxicity that depend on antibodies and / or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another passive antibody therapy form, for example, uses monoclonal antibodies that are produced, is being developed.
The production of the serum is convalescent, which is a fluid part of the patient's blood that has been cured and containing a specific antibody against the virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius, a group of closely linked syndrome.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later got infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
