The cumulative incident of coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic and Great Britain, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic and Great Britain countries that confirm that, although its stages vary depending on the state, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
According to Italian experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown case of pneumonia with ethyology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the disease's causative agent as a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CAV-2 infections have been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of people with COVID-19 suffer from a mild disease, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases had critical diseases that required intensive care.
Mortality of patients who were hospitalized by COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we reviewed the trends of cumulative COVID-19 European Union countries (EU/EEEA) and Great Britain (U.K.) and then compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We're also comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during January 31st, 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 is experiencing further geographical dissemination and COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in the rest of the world today following the pandemic dynamics in China.
On March 11, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with the COVID-19 case confirmed based on WHO's definition.
At EU/EEEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020, to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected throughout 30 EU/EEEA and Great Ingris (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date included 39.768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, with 17750 cases and 1,41 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of the COVID-19 case
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 that every country around the world is notified every day at 8: 00 p.m. is obtained only from legal sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK, and it compares them to Italian trends.
As the prevalence proxy of the COVID-19 case is active, we calculate the cumulative incident of 14 days, so consider the natural journey COVID-19, in every EU/EEA and UK state, in the January 1st, March 15th, 2020.
We also present a cumulative number of cases that every country has informed us of until March 15, 2020 at 8:00 p.m. compared with the Italian case during the January 31st, 15th, March 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in EU/EEEA and UK
The cumulative trends of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UK countries generally follow the trends in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Picture 1).
For EU/EEEA and UK overall, the cumulative COVID-19 incident began to rise about February 21, then it increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
This trend is largely moved by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEEA countries and UK have shown the trend of increasing cumulative COVID-19 incidents.
Image 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared with the cumulative number in Italy during January 31st, 15th March 2020.
The data highlights that, up to March 15, at 8: 00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEEA countries and UK countries have reported a total number of cases equivalent to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in EU/EEEA and UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative COVID-19 incident indicate that pandemics rise at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is in spite of the different stages that countries experience, variations in public health responses, and possible definition differences in cases between state and protocol differences in choosing patients who should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes after-testing.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region described the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this area had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, the COVID-19 case receipts at the hospital and/or intensive care units at the EU/EAA level are only available for 6% each case and 1% of the cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study conducted in 2010-211 showed a huge variation in the availability of bed intensive care and madya treatments in Europe, ranging from 29,2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 bed intensive care and madya treatment per 100,000 population by 2010-211).
The modeling scenarios related to the durability of health - care capacity, with a prevalence estimate of the COVID-19 incendiary case for every EU/EEA and UK country associated with the risk >90% exceeds the capacity of intensive care bed, are provided in the six updated ECDC risk assessments of COVID-19.
Because so far the most clustered cases in certain countries of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a population of certain regional services coverage, information on cases and intensive care bed should be provided at Section Name for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and trends today in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the transmission scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 communities and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the most populated region in Italy.
As shown in the recent rapid ECDC risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is vital to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from the dam approach to the mitigation approach, because the increase in number of fast cases, as anticipated, may not allow enough time for the decision makers and the hospital to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if it is not applied before.
The quick risk assessment also lists public health measures to investigate the impact of pandemics.
There's a short window of opportunity when the state has a chance to further increase its control efforts in slowing the SARS-CV-2 spread and reducing the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEEA health care system will likely face a spike in patients who need intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
An outbreak of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologist virus, SARS-Cov, which led SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has lower levels of severity and mortality than SARS, but it is contagious and more about the elderly than young people, and more in men than in women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on this new disease, the article tried to give a timely and comprehensive review of the fast - growing subject of research.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, ethyology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and weeks following the outbreak of a new virus.
This virus was very homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was given the name SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoVease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients released and 3,000 patients dead.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "number 1 public enemy" and potentially destructive more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established the sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review endeavors to sum up the progress of research in the field of this fast - growing new subject.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV - related diseases, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what has been learned so far about prevention and disease prognosis and other unanswered questions, but urgent.
According to tradition, the CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for human beings, mainly leading to about 15% of the 4 colds.
Even so, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic CVs for humans twice, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is now the third CAV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1,1, pneumonia clusters with unknown origins were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to towns, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections of health care providers were reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmissions might occur.
On January 23 the quarantine of the region was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly connected to Wuhan's seafood market considered to be the first location of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared this epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr.2).
Because the situation is growing very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak must still be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 of the COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.q.com/S/UlBi-HX_rHPX1HA2bha).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people infected over 50 years of age, few under 20, and only 14 infected people under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 extends in clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from awit to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive numbers (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3,51 to 4,05) and R0 are spoken for 2.23-4,82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to a massive transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients with a confirmed 1.44% (95% CI: 1,10-1.86%) and mortality specified for all patients by 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (1060), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large virus subfamiliation that contains a single strand of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genus, which is alpha, beta, gamma and delta, with alpha- and beta-cov known to infect humans.
Glicoprotein bumps or spikes (S) cover binds to their cell receptors, enzyme exchanges of angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and is executed peptide 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus RNA genome was released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the virus' genome, the RNA genomics accompanied the cover glycoprotein and the nucopsid protein formed a vesicle containing virion, which then experienced fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
SARS-CoV-2's genomic sequence was first reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarities among 10 licensed samples; the sample was taken from the site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-Cov than MERS-Cov.
Through the electron microscope transmission, SARS-CV-2 particles were found in the very thin parts of the human airway epitelium.
ACE2 human beings found to be the receptor for SARS-CAV-2 as well as SARS-CV.
Even so, S SARS-CoV-2 proteins bond with ACE2 are weaker than they are with S SARS-CoV proteins, which are consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection of SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encrypted with orf3b and protein secreted with an orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibition of the IFN expression; however, orf8 has no functional domain or known motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete ACE2 cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.9 ▪ in the complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is arranged to form a dime and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be targeted as a therapeutic target in drug treatment to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Source and middleman
SARS-CAV and MERS-CAV are known to come from bats and each transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through a filogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with another CoV, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVX45 and bat-SL-CovX21.
However, the intermediary host who helped the virus cross the species barriers to infect humans remains unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed the snake as the carrier of the virus from the bat to a human who involved homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the mills, long-tinted mammals that are often used in traditional Chinese drugs, are potentially the host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genetic homology found in the CoVs and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences that spread throughout the genome remain a big difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence remain unreachable (Gbr. 3).
SARS-CoV-2's physiochemical properties are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectants containing chlorine, perasetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but instead of chlorexidin, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have reported on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other CoV studies before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4.4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is identified by the built-in immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which include C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different paths, viruses induce expressions of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon synthesis of type I (IFN) which restricts the spread of viruses and speeds up phagocytes of antigen viruses by macrophage.
However, N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon an adaptive immune response joined in the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
T cells CD4+ stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses, and T CD8+ cells kill virus - infected cells directly.
Rescue T cells produce prolatory cytokin to help protect the cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit cell T's function by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize the MERS-Cov.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system produces a large number of local free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, compound organ failure and even death.
SARS-CAV-2 infection, marked by a twitter cluster, is more about the elderly with an instigator and pregnant woman.
Generally, people exposed to large quantities of viruses or whose immune functions are disturbed have a higher chance of infection than anyone else.
The average incubation period of SARS-CV-2 is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on studies against the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,0099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, indicates that the period of incubation is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) a day based on demographics 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a common practice, exposed to a virus or infected people are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended 24 days?
Fever is often a symptom of major and early COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, asphyxiation, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, sore throats, rinorea, chest pains, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the awitan disease.
In severe cases, the development of a patient's illness is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung imaging disorders, must be distorted against viruses for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies in late December 2019 show that percentages of symptoms of 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, which is the study of family clusters and clusters caused by transmissions from environmental people.
In comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-Cov patients also have fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with the preferred MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (2025%), and throat pain (13-25%) are shown as a major symptom and ventilation support is needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
Until February 14, COVID-19's mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, mortality is 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 647 with a trust interval (CI) 95% of 5,71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV ranged only between 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparisons with MERS-Cov and SARS-CV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given on Table 1.
The numbers show that SARS-CAV-2 has higher spread capabilities than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov pandemic.
Adolescent literature is often found in one family or from a group or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacting infected people or patients in the past two weeks before awitan.
However, it is reported that people can carry a virus without showing any symptoms for more than two weeks and that returning patients from the hospital can carry another virus, causing caution to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreasing number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and increased levels of amino transferage and viremia found in 1,0099 COVID-19 patients.
The enzyme levels of liver and muscle and mioglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood-sanitary rates increase in most patients.
In heavy cases, the D-dimer levels increase, which is a progressive decrease in the fibrine product, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
The disorder of the thracic photo was found on a large COVID-19 patient and marked by bilateral cloud shadow or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop athyl pneumonia, acute lung injuries, and acute distress syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occur, uncontrolled inflammatory, fluid accumulated, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbated gas exchange disorder.
Pneumotiontic dysfunction type I and type II lower the surfaction level and increase the pressure of the surface so that it lowers the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the worst finds in the photo thrax are often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first internal pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed many pneumotional desulations, the formation of hialin membranes, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as synsitial cells in the lungs of patients who died from this disease, according to the pathology of viral and ARDS infections and similar to the pathology analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
Detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 via counter transcriptage polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the primary criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high level of false negatives, which could speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has occurred in SARS ' diagnosis.
Hence, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a necessity for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described the use of SHERLOCK-based techniques based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2 fragments, which detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments on 20 × 10-18 moles up to 200 × 10-18 moles/L (10-100 microliters per input) using a glow stick in less than an hour without needing a complex instrument.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly enhance sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors primarily offer support care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various previously used or proposed therapies for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Tabel 2].
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapies with antivirus drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese drugs, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of a cured patient is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support, therefore, is vital to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high - flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported with the oxygenation of the extractorporeum membrane (ECMO), which is a life - threatening cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for heart failure or respiratory care.
In addition, electrolyte balance guard, secondary infection prevention and septic shock, as well as vital organ protection are vital for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune responses are known to result in cytokin storms on SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokin is a systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the release of a series of cytokines, which includes TNF., IL-1
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the leading cause of ARDS and compound organ failure.
Imunosuppression is essential in handling cytokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Korticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosupression handlers for cytokin storms include immune response modulation directed by T cells; IFN- mending, IL-1, and TNF; jak inhibition; blintumab; sytokin signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatments to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids on high doses are useless for severe lung injuries to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, steroids can result in severe side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which have a profound influence on prognosis.
Nevertheless, giving a short corticosteroid at low doses is being encouraged to be carefully administered to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir's intravenous giving, a nucleotide analog, was found to have a value on an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, originally for treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
In time, remdesivir also showed inspiration of the other single - strand RNA virus, which included the MERS and SARS virus.
According to this, Gilead provides this compound for China to perform a series of trials on SARS-CV-2 infected people, and the results are greatly anticipated.
Also, baricitinbs, interferons, lopinavirs/ritonavirs, and Ribavirins have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after a combination of therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and the manufacture of antibodies
There is a long history of the blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
True, cured patients often have relatively high antibody levels in their blood.
The antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecules in pathogens, and neutralize them immediately.
According to this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of COVID-19 patients and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, along with decreased inflammatory and viral burdens and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarifying need to be done to present such methods for the use of large scale before specific therapies are developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some lacks related to plasma must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate an excessive immune response and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is potentially life - threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is required in large quantities to care for critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic is hard to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovering patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective antibody impairment on proteins that matter to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of components in the formula, and it depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because they are difficult to extract or verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Now, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 have not yet existed, TCM has become one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top healing rate in COVID-19 patient therapy is observed in some Chinese provinces that use TCM on 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which uses TCM only at about 30% COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very harsh because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends published a study comparing Western drug therapy with just WM and TCM joint therapy.
They found that the time it takes to recover body temperature, loss of symptoms, and treatment is much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
The more impressive thing is, the level of hunting symptoms (from light to weight) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% than 46.2%) and the low mortality in the WM+TCM group compared with the WM group alone (8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM's efficacy and security are still waiting for better controlled trials on a larger scale and on more research centers.
Another interesting feature is identifying work mechanisms and clarifying effective components in TCM therapy or combinations, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were deeply fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the initial phase of SARS plague, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor fluctuations, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even sucidality were reported.
Tracking of contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected people, and those in contact with them, as well as the public in need.
Psychological support must include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and plans for therapy as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are essential to breaking the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and humans are infected to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary antivirus therapy in controlling epidemics caused by viral emergence.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines, which are long-term and effective in producing neutralization antibodies and/or immunes that protect against SARS-CV.
For SARS, live-weakened vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, this vaccine candidate in vivo's efficacy in the elderly and its first-rate model as well as its protection against zoonotic viral infections will still have to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there continues to be a zoonotic source in the pandemic.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS by using a disabled virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruslike particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 that are safe and effective for non-immunes is a very urgent and important task to control an ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily resolved because it's a long time to develop vaccines and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show thousands of patients the full clinical journey.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with morbidity and high mortality in patients with severe cases.
Hence, the formation of a model of disease prognosis is essential for health care to give priority to its services, especially in a limited area of resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mainly at age 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in studies containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have inclusive comorbidity and complications as well as are significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 over 51), which signals age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: Patients of COVID-19 who require intensive care have a greater probability of having acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
Heart events also address the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be able to bond with colangocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in the COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can influence one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactic dehidrogenase (LDH), aspartat amino transferage (AST), alinin amino transferage (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Toraks photos and developing temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As noted above, steroids is a largely used immunosuppression therapy for infection disease to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in SARS patients, many survivors of this disease eventually suffer from a lifetime of astrophysic avascular dysability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids must be used at low doses and short periods of time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As noted above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they must undergo long - term quarantines and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological consequences and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a distinct epidemiological description of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or without symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to those that cause the cold.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation phase, infected patients can produce large quantities of virus during everyday activities, which creates a major difficulty in controlling epidemics.
However, SARS-Cov transmissions are believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them don't occur in early phases.
The COVID-19 outbreak is thus far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, great efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost all populations in the hopes of disconnecting SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Although this action is very damaging to the economy and to other sectors of the country, the new number of patients has dropped, indicating an epidemic slowdown.
The most optimistic estimate states that the outbreak will end in March and the drop phase lasts for 3-4 months.
Some other experts, however, are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. confirms that the COVID-19, which seems far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and claimed that SARS-CV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reports that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-concas and patients ' healed throats and came home from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the reidentized virus could be a repeat episode, similar to the influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs occur in China, if viewed as based on the decline in the number of new cases, which suggests that the current strategy might work.
The original Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as much death as it does.
With quarantine and strict isolation, however, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that can't be too pathogenic with humans.
The COVID-19 epidemic comparison with SARS and MERS epidemic was given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through cough or sneeze, and probably also through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the feses, thus producing a new possible transmission, which is feses-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosconomic infections, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be in contact with an infected person or patient.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and the N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s serial number) help control the spread of the virus.
A surgical mask keeps the saliva of potentially infected people out of the air or attaches itself to the surface of the material, where the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 (the series number 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation at a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely regulate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can suppress even five surgical masks that are stacked into one, health care providers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95s and not a surgical mask.
In addition to the mask, health care providers have to wear the right isolation cloak to reduce contact with the virus more.
Viruses can also infect someone through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; a virus may have entered his body through an inflammatory eye.
Therefore, health care providers also have to wear transparent facial shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially exposed areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self - quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is believed to fit to keep distance from the patient.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a huge warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has a low-intensity spread and limited reproductive capacity from man to man and the prevention and transmission of this disease is not a problem.
This message calms people's fears, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, so that the critical time is passed to prevent the disease still on a small scale in Wuhan.
The disease - control agency in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because each word is noted by the residents and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) more limited to stemming the potential of epidemics in the early stages, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often include targeted and effective public awareness of epidemics and testing and periodic response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CAV-2 virus that began to spread at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression of a SARS outbreak repeating itself.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to preventing epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 has more on the elderly than young people and more on the men than on women, and death rates are also higher in the elderly than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% than 1,44%).
The COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they're non-resident, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they're seriously ill.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and wider than SARS-Cov.
Asai RNA routine to check SARS-CoV-2 can provide negative results on some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a cured patient can bring back positive results on a virus examination.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
So quickly the progress of COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although found genetic homology at 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two like-SARS bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal is a medium species to transmit the virus from the host of, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, we can't cut off transmission effectively and the plague can spread back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical settings show that SARS-CV-2 is bonding with ACE2, how exactly does a virus get into the airway cells and cause further pathological changes?
Does this virus also bond with cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is this epidemic going to last?
How did the virus evolve genetically during the transmission between humans?
Is this pandemic going to be a worldwide pandemic, ending up like SARS, or repeating periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are vital, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to return to normal life.
The origin of the human corona virus.
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved co-evolved corona virus and its host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CAVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as colds.
The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how damaging and life - threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenism than his brother, SARS-Cov.
The HCoV infection is a zonosis, therefore, an understanding of the origin of the HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats, and in these animals, viruses are not pathogenic.
Inang reservoirs between several HCoVs have also been identified.
The identity of the host of animals has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Investigating CoV-inang interactions in animals can also provide an important insight into the CoV pathogenic in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of today's knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of his discovery and the origin of his zoonotics and interspecies transmissions.
The important thing is, we compare and contrast the HCoV from the evolutionary point of view and recombination of the genome.
The 2019 CoV epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for a successful host's transition and the implications of viral evolution on the severity of disease are also highlighted.
The corona (CoV) virus comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of cloaked RNA viruses, positive berry, and single - stringed.
It has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobasa between RNA viruses called "CoVs," because of its morphological resembled crowns under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, the CoV has an unintegrated genome that has a similar setting.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) overlap each other. both are translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replication.
Poliprotein is further processing to form 16 nonstructureal proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open reading frames (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bumps or spikes (S), veils or envelope (E), membranes (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of protein complements that are specific to certain bloodlines are also encoded by various CoV bloodlines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified as four genus (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genes, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is divided into four bloodlines (A, B, C, C, and D).
The filogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are largely the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, the CAV has continued to cross species barriers and some CAVs have become important pathogens in humans.
Up until now, there have been seven known human CAVs.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory corona virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe ventilator infections on relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the cold nose of a patient in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both leading to self-healing symptoms.
In fact, the concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in history today, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with spores spreading to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, was a causative epidemic of 2019 virus disease (COVID-19), which had claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people to March 3, 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, rats, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, and in bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpatogenic, but they show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The trace of the HCoV zoonotic origin gives the framework to understand natural history, driving power, and restriction factors between species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the host's search for reservoirs, intermediaries, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications in the prevention of future dissemination.
In this review, we gave a general picture of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmissions, and HCoV pathogens.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that the HCoV stem virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after transmission between interspecies to a new host.
We also examine HCoV's evolutionary trends that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by a decline in pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to HCoV-229E's first strain of cold - conditioned patients' snot, various CoVs have been isolated from infected animals, which include turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (Tabel 1) is an informative clue.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the patient's airway infection of the upper airway in 1966, which was then adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 pulmonary cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show cold symptoms, which include headaches, sneezes, lethargic, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and cough visible at 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial pathways in the breast-feeding brain.
Clinical images of HCoV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symtomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhhinovirus viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are scattered around the world and tend to be the most transmitted during winter in temperate climate areas.
Normally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by illness for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected with HCoV-229E has a mild cold.
Few patients with weakened immune systems indicate a severe sub-breath infection.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia atiitis," is the first well documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its ethyological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, scattered across countries and continents.
In spite of the super infectious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with a period of 4 to 7 days in incubation and a top load of the virus seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Infected patients SARS-CoV were initially mialgia, headaches, fevers, lethargic, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, an abnormal liver function test, and an increase in quinane creatin is a common laboratory disorder in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion, epitel cell proliferation, and macrophage increase are also observed on SARS patients.
Next, about 20 to 30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Besides lower respiratory channels, some organs that include gastrointestinal, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by cytoxin storms, which can be lethal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from open lung biopsy relatives of Patient Zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old from Holland by the end of 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young, elderly, and weak immune patients who suffer from respiratory disease.
Coriza images, conjunctivitis, fever, and broncholitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the same isolated virus from specimens of eight-month-old boys suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in Holland, the virus is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and peaks occur early in summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to obstructive laryngitis, which is also called knap.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was treated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitics, HCoV-Hku1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma exaserbates.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 are found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
The four HCoV communities have completely adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into a very pathogenic disease, although the extraordinary cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of HCoV-NL63 subtypes which have recently been reported to have caused a severe subsidiction infection in China.
Generally, when it comes to the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, this virulence and pathogenity of HCAV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient's lung with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the lab's confirmed cases came from the Middle East, cases of imports with occasional secondary spread of contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to a clinical manifestation of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far only happened in MERS among HCoV diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases of labs were reported with a high case death, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CAV one of the most frightening viruses known to man.
By mid - to late December 2019, a pneumonia cluster that was retrospectively linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an outbreak of sub-exhalation infection is ongoing and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
Until March 3rd, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a rough death rate of 3.4%.
For the record, the death of the case in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections like SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov with a picture of fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Diarrhea was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the heaviest symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because the homology of the high nucleotide sequence, by 82%, is grouped into different filogenetic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The subject infected SARS-CoV-2 with no symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CV-2 worldwide.
Compareing and distinguishing SARS-CV-2 to six other HCoVs shows a very interesting equation and distinction.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the journey of HCAV's disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (yakni HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show a more common picture of the HCoV Infectious Community infection, which includes a picture of mild nonspecific symptoms or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a fraction of the severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CV infections, even at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions also display interesting pattern characteristics, similar to both the HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as the HCoV community.
On the other hand, decreasing SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities after multiple human pathways still need to be verified, as are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, just like all HCoVs, SARS-CV-2 can be detected from a fess sample.
"Do the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmissions play an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
The thing that's also very important to know is whether SARS-CV-2 is seasonal, as in the HCoV case of the community.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and continuous dispersion in some pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the fate of an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it is said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and human beings may be a species of ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV that causes severe human and human illness has been wiped out.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in sufficient numbers in humans to allow adaptive mutations to accumulate in order to fight host restrictions.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more infected people are, the more likely the virus is to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus adapts properly, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four CoV communities circulated in the human population and triggered colds in immunes.
This virus doesn't require animal reservoirs.
On the contrary, the highly pathogenic SARS-CV and MERS-CoV haven't adapted to humans and their transmissions in humans are untenable.
Both must defend themselves and do breeding in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediaries and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a description similar to SARS-Cov/MERS-Cov and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like the HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV communities and is non-pathonomic SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to human beings and circulate in humans without hosting reservoirs or intercessors.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediaries, and HCoV amplifiers.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have close - related ancestors and share high homology at the nucleotide level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in this host.
Similarly, the host of reservoirs carries HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV just entered the host of intermediaries just before or about the time a virus entered humans, viruses have not adapted to new hosts and are often pathogenic.
These intermediaries can function as sources of zoonotic human infections and act as hosts of amplifiers by allowing viruses to replicate temporarily, and then transmitting them to humans to amplify the scale of human infections.
HCoV can have a dead end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediary host.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediary host and even lead to long - term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data says retrospectively that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with game animals.
Next seroprevalence research indicates that the pet seller has a higher IgG prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV than the general population.
Moon Weasels and raccoon dogs in the animal market are the first to be identified as carrying a virus similar to SARS-CoV that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that the SARS case has been reported since all the weasels in the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that the lunar weasels of the wild or the farm that had not been exposed to the animal market gave largely the most negative test results for SARS-CoV, indicating that the lunar weasel may only act as the host of the intermediary, but not the natural resort SARS-CoV.
For the record, 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, which cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as hosts of SARS-CoV intermediaries.
All these hosts seem to be the final host of SARS-Cov.
The search for natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV further revealed the close - related CoV of bats called CoV Bat Rhinolopus a relative-SAS HKU3 (SARSRRR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found on the Chinese horse tapal bat.
This bat gives positive test results on anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome sequences.
This CoV and CoV other bats share homology nucleotide 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that bats were the host for new human pathogens to emerge.
Some similar CoV-SARS (SL-Cov) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Enzim changer angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat-fess samples is shown using ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the patient serum SARS convalesents can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor with SARS-CV in the bat, with 95 percent nucleotide homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct host of SARS-CoV reservoirs.
Phylogenic analysis grouped MERS-Cov into the same group as the CoV-Hku4 bats and the CoV-Hku5 bats.
CoV-Hku4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, which is peptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the virus's entrance.
The polymerase RNA sequence depends-RNA MERS-CoV is filogenetistically closer to its equivalent in beta-cov bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-Cov has been found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and his closest relative CoV-HCU25 bats share only 87% of homology nucleotide sequences.
Hence, the bats may not be the host of immediate mers-cov reservoirs.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arabian camels produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like those from the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CAV lives that are identical to viruses found in humans isolated from the use of nasal Arabian camels.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
For the record, infected camels destroy viruses not only through respiratory routes, but also through fecal-oral routes, which are also the main route of the viral decay of bats.
Even so, the question remains as many cases of MERS are confirmed to have no history of contact with camels before the symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmissions or unknown transmission routes involving an unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a RaTG13 bat bat isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov case, the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too big to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, the bat may not be the host of a live SARS-CoV-2, unless the CoV bats are almost identical found later on.
The host of animals between SARS-CV-2 is probably among the wildlife species sold and killed at Huanan Sea Food Grocery Market, many cases of early COVID-19 related to this market, indicating the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on methonomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered little mammals are also known as Javanica's pander, as well as perhaps carrying beta-coV relatives with SARS-CoV-2.
The new CoV genome shares 85-92% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is related to the RaTG13 with 90% similarities at the nucleotide sequence level.
They're both grouped into two strains of virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a filogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor (RBD) binding domain that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with the same sequencing amino acids of 97.4%.
In a striking way, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are much more different, although the level of homology of the whole genome is higher.
The previous study of the disease mill also reported the viral contig detection of the lung sample, which also turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different method of drafting and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the virus's entire genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of the mill as one of SARS-CoV-2's host animals.
However, no evidence currently supports SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from the mill because of the sequencing differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinders.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway SARS-CoV-2 in bats, millers, and other mammals still have to be set.
Although high-level homology in RBD was discovered between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trvin, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homology levels of the entire genome.
It's far too speculating that the high level of resemblance between the RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is moved by the converging evolution of the attractiveness of its mediated.
Competent hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 strrollers and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a factor in evolution, recombination is common among beta-covs.
Researchers have still not been able to decide about the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic HCoV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The filogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have come from CoV bats, while stem virus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat called ARCoV.2 (Applachian Ridge CoV) detected in three North American bats shows close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to the other CoV bats, by the name of Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which are detected in Ghana, with Camelidae as well as its intermediary host.
To be clear, current knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals known to be summed up in Image 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenic analysis has provided evidence of a transmission between HCoV transmissions in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, it was noted that there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of HCoV-229E transmissions interspecies is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's alpha-cov alpapa.
Some evidence supports transmission of the virus directly from bat to human.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may be in contact with bats in a joint ecological loop.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have a wide range of nonpatogenics in bats, while alpha-Cov alpapa causes a respiratory outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-cov alpapa was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-coV relatives - HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is, while alpha-cov bats serve as HCoV-229E genes, alpapas and Arabic camels may serve as intermediaries hosts who transmit the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CAV is an excellent example for transmissions between bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-Cov evolutionary origin of the bat is known in early identification of the virus and is also reinforced by later findings.
It's clear that bats are a rich species of virus for exchange of genetic fragments between species and interspecies transmissions.
Long life, tight colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, all of which is a supportive condition for bats to be the ideal spreader of viruses.
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has been on Arabian camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have gone from intermediary host to stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CAV causes a very mild disease and maintains the relatively low rate of mutations in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the ultimate host for MERS-CAV because transmissions cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of a camel in a MERS-Cov transmission, the role of a mill, if anything, in a SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially, beta-cov trgrills are very pathogenic in the mill.
The grinder may be the final host for the SARS-CoV relative, similar to the weasel in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans must be calculated or ruled out.
First, a bat could be the host of a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological lines with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second of all, the grinder could be one of the hosts who amplifies the intermediary for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that just entered.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of the hunted meat.
It's possible that many mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species in contact either with bats or with mills.
The search for SARS-CAV-2's original animal search is still ongoing.
In spite of all the host animals, three major factors from the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, the rate of mutation is relatively high in replication of RNA.
Compared with another single-tinled RNA virus, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered "immediate" to "high" at an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per path, depending on the CAV adaptation phase of the new host.
CoVs have exoribonuclease corrections, deletion that result in very high mutability, atenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the analog nucleotide Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through this exoribunuclease and rne polymerase-dependent RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of the CAV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its host's mutation.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CAV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV's high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2's mutation rate is actually lower, signaling a higher adaptation rate with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to another host closely related to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoVs who have adapted to Arabian camels.
Theoretically, it's unlikely that genetic drift will quickly create vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CV-2 becoming ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modifications, for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of co-evolved interspecies, which is beneficial for a new CoV to emerge when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded toward the end of the 3rd genome.
Third, CoVs frequently change templates randomly during replication of RNA through unique "chosen" mechanisms.
In a host that acts as a mixing container, the transition of strands often occurs during the transcription of the CAV RNA.
A complete RNA and a very homologous subgenome can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural biogenetic evidence of recombination has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as on animal Covs like SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction of viruses in relation to transmissions
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmissions.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during transmission events interspecies.
Based on a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolat human and weasels, SARS-CoV is thought to have a rapid adaptation in various hosts, especially with mutations in S protein RBD.
Generally speaking, RBD proteins S CoV interact with cell receptors and are intensively targeted for host antibodies.
At SARS-CoV, the RBD is the 318th amino acid to the 510th in the S1 fragment, which binds to ACE2 human and its correceptor as the passage of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to identify ACE2 receptors of different animals, which include bats, weasels, mice, raccoons, and dogs, thus enabling transmission of interspecies viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differently between isoletes of human viruses and weasels in RBD and 4 are located in the receptor binding motive for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CAV weasels have mutations K479N and S487T in their RBD, which might increase the protein-contract interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial to the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It's worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-Cov.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implies S protein binding amplification with ACE2 possible changes.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding activity and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the stronger one between ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
What's also important to know is if there's any other correceptors that might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmissions..
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are a lot of other HCoV receptors, like aminopetidase N for HCoV-229E and fucking 9-O-terasetilation acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of its host.
Besides cell receptors, the end result of HCoV interspecies transmission is also regulated by dependency factors and other host restrictions.
This host protein difference between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the host's dependency factor and break into the host's restrictions factor to succeed in interspecies transmissions.
In this case, molecular determining in the field of these important interactions of viruses still needs to be identified and characterized.
Igniting the entire genome is undisputed to see the dependency and restrictions of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the most advanced CRISPR technology might be useful.
The rise of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the plague
The diversity of the CoV bats provides a great opportunity for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this case, the CoV bats serve as the HCoV gene levitate.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoder gene potentially modifys the virus' phenotype dramatically.
Among the protein accessory SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the bat virus is a relative-SARS-CoV virus found encrypting various Orf8 proteins.
SARS-CAV with its signature removal of 29 nucleotides was found on a strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This eradication separates the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV bloodlines, with a large number of smaller recombinants identified in RNA polymerase which depends on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified on nsp9, mostly nsp10, and part nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of various bloodlines was shown in the MERS-Cov epidemic, which occurs in Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed on other HCoVs where HCoV has recombinated with other animals' CoVs in its nonstructureal genes.
It must also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from the pressure of selection experienced, such as by the host's immune system.
This example of effect is the complete loss of the ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While the whole ORF4 can be observed on bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpha-Cov alpapa shows a single nucleotide insertion that leads to shifting skeletons.
Finally, new HCoV evolution is also driven by the pressure of selection at its host's reservoir.
Symptoms or no symptoms are detected when bats are infected with the CAV, indicating an adaptation between the CoV and the bats.
It seems the bats adapt well to the CAV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, a flaw in the prolific response to bats will effectively reduce the CAV pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed because of the increased natural stem cell receptor regulations of the NKG2/CD94 barrier and the level of complex molecular expression of histompathy is a low I-class prime.
In addition, high levels of metabolic activity of bat bats can suppress CoV replication and affect the correction of exoribonuclease and thus put pressure on selection to create a highly pathogenic strain when it enters a new host.
A more pathogenic strain may also develop through recombination, resulting in a new protein gain or protein feature for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpatogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host, such as bats and camels.
The CoV replicates powerfully without triggering a strong host's immune response.
Here lies the secret of a carrier with no symptoms and the cause of heavy cases of human infection.
Heavy symptoms are largely due to excessive immune response and cytokin storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response grows stronger.
On the contrary, on the carrier without symptoms, the immune response has been released from the CoV replication.
The same strategy for breaking the connection to the immune response may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong on bats.
Therefore, an interferon-type I, at least in the early phase of SARS-CV-2 infection on humans, should be useful.
In addition, the inflammatory activating of the NLRP3 on the bat is affective.
For this reason, inflammatory inflammatory NLRP3 with MC950 may be useful in handling COVID-19.
SARS-CAV-2 appears to follow the general lines of SARS-CAV and MERS-Cov appearances.
While beta-cov bats that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been discovered, there are also CoV bats that share 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the weasels and other animals in the market were found carrying a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the host of direct middlemen for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, which suggests that the pangolin may play the role of one of the intermediaries hosts or beta-cov streverils may contribute to the genetic fragment at the end of SARSS-CoV-2.
Despite the question, there has been no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans both intentionally and by accident.
The CoV is back at the center of a recent SARS-CAV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of the origin of zoonotics and animal reservoirs to HCoV on human transmissions.
So much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from bats and transmitted to humans via intermediary host.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and weasels in the wet market, it may close the wet market and kill all the weasels in it that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, the grinder was supposed to be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of some of the beta-Cov family lines related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms are transmitted to humans through the mills and other mammals still have to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has long been in Arabian camels.
This camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as as as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local people.
Arabian camels are scattered throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as we do in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach has to be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we eliminate this virus, a new genotype can emerge and cause an outbreak.
Covs circulate in the wild.
In particular, a potential zoonotic bat's CoV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotics to evolve and recommbinate, resulting in a new, more easily transmitted CoV emergence and/or more deadly for future humans.
Culture eats wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and plan of resistance must be applied.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of dissemination.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, human chances of contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Sustainable surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the EV's ecology and its natural host, which will prove useful in preventing future transmissions of animals and outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zonosis is that humans should keep their distance from the ecological edges of the natural reservoir of the zoonotic virus.
Some of the zoonotic section of SARS-CoV-2 puzzles have yet to be found.
First of all, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pander, the condition when bats and trgrills share ecological strains is important to be known.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats must be determined.
Third, when a third mammal acts as a real intermediary host, the way the mammal interacts with another species, which includes humans, bats, and millers must be cleared.
Eventually, because many mammals, including pets who may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance have to be done.
Whether a bat, a grinder, or another mammal, is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its mother virus can almost be identified in its future natural host.
The ongoing investigation into this field will decipher the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways in animals, with crucial implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 on humans.
Update diagnostic criteria for "predictable case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be performed
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is based on our experience and is a good reference to fighting pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experiences; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies continue to be updated as well.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments on our guides and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "expect case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnosis Guide and Handling for COVID-19 (seven version) issued by the National Health Commission of China's People's Republic.
By December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is now formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and it was named the acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SA-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has drawn a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it is worth noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being updated.
For example the CoVID-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guide issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://ww.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions in some context have been changed quite a lot.
Our guides received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score - giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guides and has become a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires updates based on the Diagnosis and Handling of the latest COVID-19 (seven trial versions) and recent studies.
Based on the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm the expected case requires a combination of one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to make comprehensive analysis, or to require the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) A history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before a review of symptoms; (2) records of contact with SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities of the COVID-19 case have been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) contact history of contact with the case confirmed (Ayeh 2 cases with fever/or respirator symptoms that occur in small areas, such as homes, schools, schools, etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total white blood cells indicate normal lymphocytes, decreasing, or decreasing in the initial awitan stage.
Diagnosing a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the frequency of the entire virus shows high homogenity for the known new coronavirus; (3) positive for antibody IgM specific and Ig antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or the changes of IG-SAG-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies from negative, or the increase in remedial response phases to my levels.
We can see that the PCR real-time test of nucleic acid in the respiratory sample or blood sample is added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and February 8, 2020); then cereological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on ongoing research by researchers to search for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from airways including blood intake, which increase the availability of specimens, and support the inclusion of positive outcomes of certain antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to be alert to patients with athical symptoms and no symptoms.
Therefore, the chart of the alir Zhou et al. must be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low-ass."
Score systems also need to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
In closing, we expect more direct evidence to appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "predictable cases" and "confirmed cases," we recommend following and obeying the latest guidelines in the country.
Our team will also update our guides periodically as a favor.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest mortality in a day from the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of infections recorded involving 114 active cases and 33 recover cases living at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In an online news gap, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths include four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41-50.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told the Anadulu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anticorruption Commission, who was hospitalized in Kuwait Hospital Maitree.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader said public transportation would be stopped longer than originally planned, until Saturday.
The halt of public transportation has begun since March 26th and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transporting basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8th, two people who had just returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men were cured.
SARS-CAV-2 Infection exceeds the number of one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections exceed a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the corona virus.
The peak was the same day that Malawi confirmed her first corona virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the corona virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free of corona viral infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States (U.S.), there are recorded over 244 thousand cases of corona virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS news agency reported, quoting Johns Hopkins University's data, that there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. as a result of corona viral infection.
Around the world, countries are announcing stricter measures to inhibit the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the area until May 1st.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament took a vote to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote escaped with 215 votes in favor, ten abstain votes, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy city of Mecca and Medina until all day; before that, the curfew was only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfews between 10 and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended home orders until May 1st.
Shops in Australia reduce the purchase of toilet paper per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday afternoons, the Australian Woolworth and Coles store networks each lower the boundaries of the purchase of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at a national level.
ALDI also applies a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message in the register and on the Facebook page of his network.
The buyers reportedly piled up supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 in case the public had to do some self-separation.
On Wednesdays, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes follow the restrictions of four packs per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles each on March 4th and 5th.
In his media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the restrictions of the four pack, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery," and called the request "never before" while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable."
Sales of "sharp" last week, according to one of the Woolworths spokesmans.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the amount allowed up to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages than suppliers and increased shipping frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, says that the peritel Association is trying to increase its supplies, but the local government agency's limits for truck delivery time make it difficult.
He anticipated increased production costs, while suppliers tried to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that having released an early supply, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled the supply every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a large volume item so low in supply and, if sold out, makes a lot of space on shelves so that the rarity of goods becomes even more palatable.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and intrinsication can be [bought] and there's a huge amount, panic might be minimized, says Russel Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The producers of the toilet paper recycled Who Gives a Crap said on a Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex's toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep supply, according to news.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers took a break for the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday NT News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of insertion intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores are actually reluctant to apply boundaries, according to Australia's ABC reports on March 3rd, they say that they don't plan to apply the purchase boundaries.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, intrinsics, dry food, hand - washing soap, and flour.
Likewise outside Australia, on Sunday afternoons the English online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - as a pandemic.
Although the word "paramander" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO noted the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the journey of this pandemic.
If the state detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its subjects in response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO.
We were deeply concerned because of the rate of dispersion and severity that concerns us as well as the extent of an alarming course of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Disease Control and Prevention Center, this pandemic has "never happened before"
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "besides influenza, no respiratory channel virus has ever been tracked from its appearance to a sustainable global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "We've never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
It goes, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows WHO's decision in January that declares the outbreak an emergency of the world's troubling society.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this outbreak, "The fact is, this epidemic is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) that is continuing and caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a Worldly Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until April 10, 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been cured.
Case fatality is estimated to be 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to the common symptoms is about five days, but they can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment.
Main treatments include simptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive measures include hand washing, mouthwashing when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and isolation for people who are thought to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enforcing travel limits, quarantines, curfews, work hazard control, and closing of facilities.
This pandemic has caused severe global economic disorders, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports, and scarcity of supply that are compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been shut down both at the national and local level of 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
This virus has been released online and there's been an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against the Chinese, people with descendants and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from areas with significant cases of virus.
As a result of travel reduction and heavy industrial closure, air pollution and carbon emissions are dropping.
Health Authority in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), reported a pneumonia case cluster with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation took place early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to Huanan Sea Food Grocery Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus related to the bat coronavirus, the coronavirus grinder, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the later wet market clusters.
Among the early case clusters reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55 - year - old man from Hubei province, was probably the first.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Up to February 26, relatively a small number of cases reported among young men, with 19 - year - olds, formed 2.4 percent of cases worldwide, the head of Great Britain's scientific advisor Patrick Vallance estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before the group's immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made it official not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, Holland, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that this unreported infection was the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 suggests that the rate of infection in Italy is estimated to be larger than the case reported.
Initial estimates of basic reproductive numbers (R0) for COVID-19 are 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who don't recover, time from developing symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 and 75% have preexisted health disorders, which include cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death count of the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the dead person who gave positive test results to COVID according to official protocol.
The actual fatality resulting from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths overloaded during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID mortality count with a factor of 4-5 times that.
A woman's spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement strengthened by a nonscientific report on overly low calculations in the U.S...
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
Up to February 28th, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until March 13th, more than forty countries and territorial regions have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to areas and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender and health as a whole. The mortality ratio of cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a specified interval.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of death to cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) per April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In China, the estimated death ratio of cases drops from 173% (for people with 1-10 symptoms of January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with receipts of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Another measure covers the fatality of cases (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the fatality of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a certain population.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the fatality of infection for the overall pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit of this forecast range is in line with the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyzes the impact of the study at CFR estimates.
WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of the outbreak are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: "Without control, infectious plagues are usually horizontal and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make reasonable projections today about when it happened."
The senior Chinese medical advisor Zhong Nanshan argues that "this epidemic may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two"
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures would be required "until vaccines are available (perhaps 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, could disappear completely" and this disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repetitive virulence will depend on group immunity and mutation levels.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and an infected person can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of sputum respiration, loss of smell, asphyxiation, asphyxiation, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headaches, chills, vomiting, hemoptis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms involving breathing difficulties, chest pressure or chest pain settling, sudden confusion, trouble walking, and blueness on face and lips; medical attention is soon recommended if the symptoms of further disease can develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asystomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infections, researchers suggest that those who have close contact with the infected should be closely monitored and examined to make sure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asystomatic ratio ranges from some to 44%.
The incubation period (between infections and symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days at most, 5 days at most. for example, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost their sense of smell at first 30%, then decreased by 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to have been primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneeze, or talk; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered cough can cause droplets to push up to eight feet [1.5 m] (15 feet] (8.2 m] (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that a virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. The respiratory droplet can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, even though the virus is not generally transmitted by air.
Droplets can fall on the mouth or nose of a person who is nearby or perhaps inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (RJP), can cause a single respiratory sequence to turn into an aerosol and then spread through the air.
Spreading can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that viruses can spread through phases, these risks are believed to be low.
The Chinese government rejected possible SARS-CoV-2 transmissions by fecal-oral. Virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at the later stages of disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms, signaling that transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Only a few lab reports have been confirmed, but an asymmatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact search.
European Centers for Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
Especially found that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropillent) and rustproof steel 304, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, these vary depending on moisture and temperature, and pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that an infected person may have already touched.
The coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All traces of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are linked to coronavirus in nature, outside the human body, it can be destroyed if it is exposed to domestic soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the B bloodline) along with two strains of bats.
The virus has 96% in common at the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference between the amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequence between the grinding virus and the human virus.
To date, the ratio of the entire genome finds that at most there are 92% of the genetic matter in common between the grinding coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, it's not enough to prove that the grinder is the host of SARS-CoV-2 intermediary.
Infection by a virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately performed through the reaction of a counter-transscription chain (rRT-PCR) on an infected series or a CT imaging.
A study comparing the PCR with the CT in Wuhan showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, but less specific, with the many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for impregnating or as the first line test in a COVID-19 diagnosis."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CAV-2, which was first circulated on January 17th.
Tests using a polymerase chain reaction transcription back-time (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on respiratory samples or blood.
Results are generally available in a few hours to several days.
Generally, these tests are conducted on nasofaring steam, but windpipes can also be used. A number of labs and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
Per April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve widely of their use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Symtomatic characteristic features of radiography imaging and computing tomography (CT) in people who include simtomatic opacity of ground glass peripheral asymmetrics and no pleura efusion.
The Italian Radioological Society is setting up an international online database for imaging findings in a confirmed case.
Because overlapping with other infections such as an adenovirus, imaging without confirmation of PCR has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large Chinese study compared the results of CT chest with PCR and showed that although it was less specific for infection, imaging was faster and more sensitive so it was suggested to be considered as an inflection tool in the epidemic area.
An artificial intelligence-based neural network has been developed to detect features of virus imaging with radiography and CT.
Strategy to prevent the spread of this disease involves keeping a good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using tissues when coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissues into the trash.
People who might have been infected were advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
The steps of physical restrictions have also been recommended to prevent infection. government in various regions has restricted or urged to stop all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, viruses have reached the scale of population dispersion in most of the world's areas.
This means that viruses have spread across society, and some members of society don't know where or how they're infected. Health care providers who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact prevention, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy problem, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Cellular applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts have worked on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they're close to someone who's tested positive for COVID-19. Stirred misunderstandings on how to prevent infection; for example, rubbed noses and garging with an ineffective mouthwash.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Handwashing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after a toilet or when hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after seasoning their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap that damages its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based hand intimacies with at least 60% alcohol content based on volumes when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch eyes, noses, or mouths before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in a minute of disinfect exposure to rustproof steel surfaces), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2-75%.
Other reducers, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorixin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are any unexpected or confirmed COVID cases in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all such areas as offices, bathrooms, public areas, along with tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with bent elbows or use tissues when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately dispose of tissues.
A surgical mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the explosive droplets scattered while speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions about the time and method of using masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces with not enough clean hands, which is a major source of infection." Masker is also recommended to be used by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they're at high risk, like people who treat COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using a nonmedical facial mask made of cloth, specifically recommending the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when close (3 feet (3 feet) (less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask when using public transportation or living in a crowded place.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia bans its society from going out into public without wearing a mask or covering its nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear facial masks when going to public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires that everyone who enters the department store wear a face mask.
Israel asked all citizens to wear facial masks while in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid - March, requires passengers on trains and intercity buses wearing facial masks every April 1st.
Panama requires the use of facial masks each time outside the house, and it recommends making homemade facial masks for those who cannot buy facial masks.
Facial masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (called physical restrictions) are acts of infection control intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply methods of social restrictions by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greeting without contact, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or appeal to social restrictions in the affected areas of the plague.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, ranging from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in some region) to 50 people, and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned a meeting in a public area involving more than two people, and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disturbed immune systems that had the risk of serious diseases and higher complications were advised by the CDC to stay at home for as long as possible in public areas.
The use of the term "social limitation" suggests that people should isolate themselves socially and not encourage people to keep in touch with others through alternative ways. some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during pandemics.
These recommendations include the encouragement to have sex only with those who live with you and have no virus or viral symptoms.
Self - isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-association, and many governments require or recommend self - quarantine for the entire population living in an exposed area.
The strictest self - quarantine instructions are issued to people who belong to the high-risk group.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to the country or region with a broad spread of COVID-19 are advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days since the possibility of last exposure.
The strategy in plague control is dams or depression, as well as mitigation.
The dam was performed in the early stages of the outbreak and was intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infections and vaccines that were intended to stop the spread of disease across the population.
When it is impossible to stem the spread of disease, the next attempt goes to mitigation: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health and community care systems.
Combination of dam action and mitigation can be performed at the same time.
The expression requires even more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing basic reproductive rates to less than 1. Part of the management of the infectious disease is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to affect the epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of being overwhelmed with health care and gives more time to vaccine development and medicine.
Non-farmation interventions to deal with the epidemic include individual prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing facial masks, and self-refuge; measures at the public level intended for physical restrictions, such as shutting down schools and canceling mass meetings; community applications to encourage acceptance and participation in these kinds of interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic measures aimed at preventing outbreaks in China as outbreaks are becoming more real, such as driving throughout the city and implementing strict travel bans.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass exposure and local quarantine, and it issued a warning about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected who do self - quarantine and charge a huge fine for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases facial mask production and condemns medical supply hoarders. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowen, but not stop epidemic spreads) and suppression (reverse growth epidemics) has a huge challenge.
The optimal mitigation policy can reduce demand for health care by up to 2/3 and death by half, but still resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
The expression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulated in the human population (or until vaccines are available, if this is the first one to be achieved), because if not, the transmission will be rapidly resurfaced when the steps of the suppression are taken.
Long-term interventions to suppress pandemics have an impact on social and economics.
No specific antivirus drug has been approved for COVID-19 yet, but development efforts are under way, including existing drug testing.
Taking free - selling flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the patient's condition.
Some of the compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic medicine" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CAV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in response to the outbreak.
ECDC and European WHO regional offices have issued guidelines for primary hospitals and health care to divert resources at various levels, including focused laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and isolate positive COVID-19 patients, and improve intensive treatment capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are theories about the origin of the first case (which is called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Food Grosir Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that viruses come from one of these animals; or, in other words, viruses have zoonotic origins.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and others, Ai Fen, were reproved by her superiors for warning her out.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and told WHO.
Quite many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan who then triggered an investigation in early January. in the initial stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early January and mid - 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan was the center of transportation and transit of the main railway.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The next official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.Per 26, the United States has passed through China and Italy with the highest confirmed number of cases in the world, until April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been cured.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region limit free movements and create border control.
National responses include dams, such as quarantines (known as homes, shelter orders, or quarantine areas) and curfews. on April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in a type of quarantine in the United States, over 50 million people were quarantined in the Philippines, some 59 million people were quarantined in South Africa, and 1,3 billion people were quarantined in areas of India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a type of quarantine of the region, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates the earliest case on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed the pneumonia case cluster with an unknown cause on December 26th; this observation was notified by the hospital to CDC Jianghan on December 27.
Early genetic testing of the patient's sample on December 27, 2019 indicates a SARS-like coronavirus.
Public announcement was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31st.
WHO was told on the same day.
When this notice was issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "dispersing rumors" about the outbreak.

It also led to 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to a shopping mall in March compared with February.
The shopping center operators around the world implement additional measures, such as sanitation increases, thermal scanner installations to check customer temperature, and cancel events. According to the UN Economic Commission estimates for Latin America, a recession caused by pandemics can cause people who are in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million rural Chinese migrant workers were abandoned in homes in the outback province or trapped in the Hubei province, in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates could reach 32%.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers filed temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers filed universal credit schemes, almost half a million companies in Germany filed short-term work schemes subsidized by the government for its employees, called Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short - term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the art sector of performance and cultural heritage is largely exposed by pandemics, which affect the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent.
Art and cultural sector organizations are trying to uphold their mission (which is often publicly funded) to give the public access to cultural heritage, to keep employees and citizens safe, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, around the world and on different levels, museums, libraries, performances, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and shows canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and other recent and highly developed diseases were cancellations of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as musical and concert festivals, technology conferences, and fashion performances.
The Vatican announced that the festival of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell during the last week of Christian Prepatal repentance, was canceled.
Many dioceses encourage older Christians to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, live broadcasts online or television, while others offer drive-in or latur.
With the closing of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic archdiocese and the excommunicating of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Fridays in the exposed areas of plagues and places of worship was then shut down, while Saudi Arabia forbade the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the world's sports calendar the most significant disturbance since the Second World War.
Most big sports events are canceled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, Premier League 2019-2020, Euro UEFA 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
This outbreak upsets the plan of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but would not be more than the summer of 2021" -- worldwide, casinos and other games closed and live broadcast poker tournaments postponed or canceled.
This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting significant new registrations, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various musical groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many great theaters like Broadway also delay all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing works via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as online live broadcast concerts or making web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many Internet memes of coronavirus themed online with many people turning to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism in Chinese and East Asia, as well as in people from the most popular regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the region of Asia-Pacific.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) record racist sentiments expressed in groups around the world that Chinese deserve the virus or accept what they claim is worth the price.
Some countries in Africa also experience an increase in anti-Tinongkok sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei report discrimination because of the origin of their territory.
There's been support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas of the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspots, Italians, the first countries in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia, citizens in the countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to prevent Chineses from entering their country in an attempt to stop disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeTopan has become a trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in Great Britain and the United States reported increased levels of racist harassment and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as "Chinese Virus," a term that critics consider racist and anti-Tinongkok.
The protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North East India, bordering on China, and studying in large Indian cities are reported to have been abused in coronavirus outbreaks.
Party president Bharatiya Janata unit of the state in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them"
That statement was then denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "giant." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tinghoa residents is burning because of the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "banish waste."
Many newspapers using pay-altering have removed it for some or all their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available with open access.
Some scientists choose to hand out quick results on preprinting servers, such as bioRxiv.

Lab testing for respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods that detect the existence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infections.
The presence of the virus in the sample confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects RNA coronavirus.
These tests are specific and designed to detect the SARS-CAV-2 virus RNA alone.
These tests were used to confirm new infections or are still active.
Detect antibodies (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests indicate the number of infected people, including those with symptoms too mild to report or without symptoms.
The mortality rate of accurate diseases and the group's immune levels in the population can be determined by these results.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has any reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the amount of testing that the countries have done.
This variety may also affect significantly the fatality of reported cases, which are likely to be overcounted in some countries.
Using a polymerase chain reaction transcription of real-time (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including using nasofaring or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR tests performed on larynx were only reliable in the first week of disease.
Eventually, the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for an infected person tested in the second week, sample material can be extracted from an internal airway by using a puff catheter or a cough drop (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the reaction of a real-time transcription chain (rRT-PCR), and it formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Great Britain also developed testing on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenegiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) device that was classical on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene owned by all beta coronavirus, and the specific RDRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive an emergency use of China's National Medical Products for a PCR-CoV-2-based data detector. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the Diagnostic Panel RT-PCR New Real-CCR New Koronavirus 2019 (19nCoV) to the public health lab via International Reage Resource.
One of the three genetic tests on the old version of the test provided an unconvinced result of reagen error, and the amount of testing at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed throughout February 2020.
Tests used two components were considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that were state and local laboratories allowed to do tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on Emergency Use Authorization, where a commercial laboratory began testing early March 2020.
Per March 5, 2020, LabCorp announces the available COVID-19 test based RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity boundaries are announced; the collection and processing of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 trials were developed and produced by the Virological State Research Center and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infections.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued authorisation of emergency usage (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on m2000 Abbott's system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic non-PCR amplification technology.
Since it does not require a series of temperature cycles, it can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind nucopassid proteins (N protein (protein) new coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that "a small diagnostic photograph in its early stages, as opposed to the discovery of the CT [computted tomography] may have existed before the awitan symptoms".
Typical feature of CT includes ground-glass multilobar multilateral opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominations, crazy palving, and consolidation form as disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing the PCR with the CT at the current point of pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for impregnating or as the first line test in diagnostic COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial exposure.
Parts of the immune response to infection are antibody formations that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after the receipt of symptoms, to determine immuneness to disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be performed in central labs (CLT) or with point-of-care testing.
The automatic system with high yields in many clinical labs will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used by one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used by one specimen of peripheral blood obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction measures were not necessary before the inspection. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provided notifications to agencies as necessary and therefore could now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on the authorization for emergency usage. the IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in the blood sample.
The test capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR checks on the RNA virus.
Antibodys were usually detected 14 days after infection receipts began in April, Great Britain found that none of the antibody test devices it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devises a scheme so that the alleged patient can stay home, the emergency department will give the test tube to the patient"; they spit into it, send it back, and get a test results shortly later; the British NHS announces that the NHS is pioneering a suspect case test scheme at home so eliminating the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect ambulance if used.
The lantural testing center has helped the South Koreans to do the fastest and largest test of any country, and on March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany had the capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient system and 10,700 tests had been done in the previous week.
Health insurance costs if the test is asked by the doctor.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the full capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a flat test was offered in several major cities.
Per March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is not known because only positive results are reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested the method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, combining samples and only tested more positive samples.
With construction being supervised by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling suggests that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and related costs for quarantine treatment could double if this test capacity did not exist.
Wuhan Laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
Per March 4th, 2020, a total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The multiple open source design released by Origami Assays can test 1.222 patients' samples for COVID-19 using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be run in small labs without needing robotic fluid handlers.
By March, insufficient shortages and numbers of reagens had been an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, Great Britain, and the United States.
Because of that, some researchers attempted to explore sample preparation protocols involving sample warming at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirate Union reportedly did more testing of the coronavirus per capita population than any other country, and was prepared to increase the scale of testing for most populations.
This was achieved through a combination of tissue testing and the purchase of population-scale mass laboratories from Groups 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection lab "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab was able to do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first lab to have this scale outside of China.
Test recipes targeting various parts of the DNA profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German recipes for the production of test tools that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control were not available until January 28 and thus slowed down the tests available in the U.S... at the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide supply of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, a high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus causing hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for work in private U.S. labs, and the supply of bribes and chemical reagers has become critical.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem on their equipment.
In the United States, test tools developed by the CDC had "disabled"; governments then removed bureaucratic barriers preventing private testing; Spain purchased test tools from Chinese Shenzhen Bioaxy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that improper results may be due to failure in collecting samples or using properly tested tools.
The Spanish Ministry said that they were going to pull out the equipment that came up with the wrong result, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment that the Czech Republic of China bought came up with incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test tools be thrown into the Danube river. but in early April 2020, they announced that this tool could not be used.
Testing, followed by the quarantine of a tested positive person and tracking a person who's in contact with a positive SARS-CV-2, provides a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the city of V▪ Italy, the first site of death caused by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, some 10 days away.
About half of the people tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions to this community, new infections are eliminated entirely.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than any other developed world despite extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but the schools reopened on time after March 23rd.
Other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on travel, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower fatality of cases, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no test capacity, and a national lab with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples of COVID-19 and ten of the first negative samples to one of the 16 WHO references labs for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "%Results Positive Test" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people in hospitals will have % higher positive results than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same factor.
Washing hands, also called hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning one's hands for the removal of undesired dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which is transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the mucosa membrane).
Five critical moments throughout the day that it is very important to wash your hands with soap is: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or birds.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning the kid who just used the toilet.
After clearing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal waste.
The cleanliness of medical hands refers to a practice of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, corona virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
Studies conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand - washing practice could have a slight increase in the growth of young children.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing their hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate of the disease by nearly 50%.
An intervention that promotes hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; this intervention can be performed by providing clean water in low - income areas.
48% of case reductions in diarrhea can be linked to washing hands with soap. The most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior is done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the number one cause of child mortality; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making soap wash with soap before eating and having used toilets became an embedded habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, and reduce diarrhea death by almost half and acute respiratory infections to one quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene.
Handwashing also protects itself from the impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of washing your hands is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage caused by skin drying.
Studies conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that overhand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand exim or hand - dematist, which are especially common among health officials.
Handwashing is also often seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the infection of disease by fecal-oral, which is: before and after using the toilet (Use, defamation), after cleaning a child's ass (changes diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw birds.
Another important time to apply the right hand washing technique to prevent infection is before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal dung or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced soap washing. a 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest level at 23 percent. some behavioral methodology of improving behavior to improve the development of hand washing with soap at a critical time. Washing the hands of students at a time that had been determined was one of the option in developing countries to get used to wash their hands in child behavior.
A Health Care Program that the Philippine Department of Education applies is an example of a proper scale measure of support for child health and education.
The delivery of worms twice a year, coupled with washing your hands every day with soap and brushing your teeth every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
The program was also successfully applied in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganism from the skin is reinforced by an addition of soap or washing into the water.
The main work of soap and laundry is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase the solvent power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because fats and proteins, which are components of organic waste, do not easily dissolve in water.
Nevertheless, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, since its reusable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from its previous use.
A small number of studies studying the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was impossible because bacteria were defamated with foam.
Even so, the CDC still states "liquid soap which it spends on a container without touching hands is preferred."
Antibacterial soap is massively bred to health conscious societies.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended better for antibiotics resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as tricholosan, with a list of extensive strains of resistant organisms.
So even if an antibiotic - resistant strain is not targeted by antibacterial soap, it may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to the fossils and protective substances of the skin, advanced formulation can contain acid (an acetic acid, askorbat acid, lactic acid) as a pH control, benzoate acid as an active antimicrobial acid, and more skin conditioner (a crocodile's tongue, vitamins, menthol, plant extract). A comprehensive analysis of the Oregon University Health School School of Health indicates that soap is as effective as antibacterial soap with a consumer level of trick in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
The warm water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
The soapy warm water is more effective than the soapy cold water in eliminating natural oil that withstands dirt and bacteria.
In contrast with many people's beliefs, however, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand or antiseptic activators are water - based cleaning agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand sanitizers of water - based alcoholics (also called alcohol - based hand rubers, antiseptic hand rubers, or hand ringers) came to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are isopupil based on alcohol or ethanols that are formulated along with utensils such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) become gel or together like glycerin into fluid or foam to be used and to reduce the effects of draining from alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide dilutes further antimicrobial activity. at least 6095% of alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Alcohol - rubers kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (confess HlV, herpes, RSV, rhhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
The 70 percent alcohol-injured alcohol in the hands of 99.97% kills 99.97% (Default log 3.5, similar to 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (Femic 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands a minute after use.
Alcohol - based hand integrityists are virtually ineffective with the Norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. Antiseptic hands or alcohol scrubers in sufficient amounts must be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as between the cracks and the tips of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing rather than hand rubbing, especially when hands look dirty.
The increased use of the activating agent because of ease in the use and activity of rapid killings on microorganisms; yet, the intrinsing agency should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand-initiating can often cause dry skin, unless emolien and/or skin moisturizer is added to the formula.
Drying effects from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand-initiation emoliens cause irritation and skin drought to be much lower than antimicrobial soap and washing.
Dermatics of allergic contact, urticary contact syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubers are rare.
A lower tendency has led to disturbing contact dermatitis into the appeal of this product than washing your hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents don't clean their hands of organic matter, they only get infected.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in hand.
The efficacy of alcohol - free hands depends largely on its materials and formulation, and historically, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the formulation that uses benzalconium chloride has proved to have constant and cumulative antimic activity after its use, unlike alcohol, which its efficacy proves to be reduced after repeated use, perhaps because of progressive side reactions.
Many in low - income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but it is less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if it's contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash, it might increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if it comes in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternative soaps when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique based on the recommendation of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for prevention of infection includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold water flowing.
Water flows are recommended because the silenced basin may be contaminated, while water temperature appears to have no effect.
Shake hands by rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and it takes longer to remove more germs.
Rinse it thoroughly under the running water.
Rinsing inside the basin can get the hands contaminated again.
Dry it with dry rags or let it dry in the air.
Wet, moist hands are more likely to be contaminated, where the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers, and under the fingernails is often missed.
Composed nails and peeled nail polish can store microorganisms.
Parched lotion is often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection infection.
Low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, flow water from jerrygens or bottles hung and hollowed and/or used ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In a situation where limited water supply (like schools or rural areas in the developing world), there is a water-saving solution, such as "tippy-tat", and other low - cost options.
Tippy crust is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hung with rope, a lever operated by feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies have shown that paper laps are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and was sponsored by the more modern jet hand dryer, European Tissue paper.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria found to increase by an average of 194% in the knuckles and 254% in the palms of the hands.
Draining with jet air dryer caused an average total increase of 42% bacteria in the knuckles and 15% in the palms of the hands.
After washing and drying your hands with paper laps, the total number of bacteria is reduced by 76% in the knuckles and 77% in the palms of the hands. The scientist also does tests to determine the potential of cross contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of each sort of drying method.
Jet air filterers, which blow air out of units at a rate claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/hour; 400 mph), are able to blow microorganisms out of hands and units and potentially pollute other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of warm hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The paper wipes showed no significant distribution of microorganisms. In 2005, in the study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After the hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
There are many hand dryer manufacturings, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper rags.
Handwashing using hand - reenactment tissues is an alternative during travel without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand integrityist must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the infection rate decreased by the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using large amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub each piece of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with fingers intertwined.
If there's dirt under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water at hand, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with clean wipes.
After it is dry, paper laps are used to turn off water taps (and open the exits if necessary).
It avoids the hand-contamination of the surface.
The goal of washing your hands in health care is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can lower blood flow infection rates related to catheter to 66 percent, the World Health Organization has published sheets that show the standard of handwashing and hand rub in the health care sector.
WHO's hand sanitary concept can also be seen on his website for public comments.
The relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commersil devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstrations of obedience to rules are needed.
The World Health Organization has five moments to wash its hands:
after being exposed to the body's blood
before the aseptic task, and
After patient treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soaps (the soaps "drug" or "anthyrobial") kills the handwasher.
The kill function may be desired before performing surgery or in a situation when an antibiotic resistant is very common. To "brush" hands before surgical surgery, it requires a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chloric wash or iodine, a sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long scrubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When flushing, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing his hands, the hands were dried with sterile cloth and the surgical robes were worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand intimacy before and after handling the sick.
For the control of the staffiloccus infection in the hospital, it was discovered that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefits that were obtained were very little when the frequency of hand cleaning increased above 35%.
The comparison between rubbing your hands with alcohol-based solution and washing your hands with antibacterial soap at 30 seconds each suggests that alcohol-based hand rubers reduce contamination of bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol - based hand rubers to reduce the H1N1 influenza virus and the hand - based Clostridium difficile spores. Intervention to improve the hygiene of the health care system can involve education for the staff about hand washing, improving alcohol - based supply of hands, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is required to learn of the most effective interventions in various health - care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost - saving way to attain good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand - washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes the target a challenge to achieve universal hand - washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although there is an option for making cheap handwashes.
After all, a low level of hand washing can also be attributed to an embedded habit and not to lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement to wash your hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long - term changes in the behavior of the population.
To proceed effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
The systematic review of 70 studies found that the effective community-based approach to improving hand washing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. one example of the washing of the school was "The Three Stars Approach" by UNICEF which prompted the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a handwash can be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce child sickness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign that is trying to achieve the purpose of behavioral change. 2019-2020 virus pandemic, UNICEF promotes handwash emoji use.
Some studies study the effectiveness of the overall hand washing costs in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year or the size of the year lost because of illness.
One review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for vulnerable people, is that of a mother who had recently given birth or injured soldiers in a hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneer hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modual nursing " in England.
At the time, many still believe that infections are caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, food - borne plagues and health - related infections made the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The flu outbreak of 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries that it was important to wash our hands with soap to protect ourselves from the infectious disease.
For example, posters of "the right hand washing" were hung next to the wash sink in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" something means expressing someone's aversion to being responsible for something or getting involved in something.
That expression came from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it had become a broad expression used in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands constantly to clean up imaginary stains; actions that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been noted that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value the hand - washing equipment more.
Further, the person who is allowed to wash his hands after such meditation has a less likely involvement in "cleanse" compensation, such as volunteering.
Religion commands hand washing of many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindus, tevital and yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam, religion also commands handwashing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim religions require hand washing after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddha, Sikh, Jews, and Islam require washing of their hands before and after meals.
Workplace dangerous control for COVID-19
The danger control of the workplace for COVID-19 is the application of safety methodology and occupational health for dangerous control for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The exact danger control at work depends on work and job assignments, which are based on risk assessments of exposure, the severity of society's illness, and risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Health (OSHA), low - exposure jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other workmates; for this work, it is recommended to prevent basic infection measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if ill, respiratory ethics, and perform routine cleaning and infection of the environment.
The risk of exposure may include work that requires close contact or frequent contact with people unknown or allegedly suffering from COVID-19, but it may be infected by infection in an ongoing society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have the same contact with the general public as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail settings.
Harm control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high efficiency filters, protection against sneezes, and providing self-protective devices when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health and morgues exposed to people known or allegedly suffering from COVID-19 risk of high exposure, which increases at great risk if workers perform aerosol - producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate danger control for this worker includes technical control, such as a negative pressure vent room, and a self - protection device that corresponds to work.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of demand and in terms of access to these items (like outside of rush hour shopping, through delivery, or management).
Finally, shipments of items from the highly exposed geographical region of the COVID-19 can be disturbed. The preparedness and planning of infection diseases can be used to guide protection measures.
Plans consider the risks associated with various workplaces and jobs, including the source of exposure, the risk factors that arise from home and society, as well as the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Plans also describe the necessary control to overcome these risks and the emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The preparedness and planning of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the outbreak involves reducing infection among staff, protecting those who are at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing bad effects on other entitys in the supply chain.
The severity of illness in the community in which business is influenced the action of resistance taken.
The danger control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in the safety and health of work to group danger control based on its effectiveness.
When COVID-19's danger cannot be eliminated, most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative property, and finally self-protective devices.
Technical control involves isolateing employees from work related dangers without depending on worker behavior and can be the most cost - efficient solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that require work actions or laborers.
Self - protection devices (APD) are considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but they can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APD should be selected based on danger in workers, installed correctly as is true (e.g., respirator), worn consistently and correctly, checked, treated regularly, and replaced regularly, if necessary, and removed, and cleaned, and kept properly or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration, job risks low exposure have minimal job contact with public and other coworkers.
The basic preventive measures of infection recommended for all workplaces include careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering cough and sneeze, providing tissues and garbage containers, preparing work from a long distance or a shift of gradual arrivals, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing routine cleaning and infecting work environments.
Quick identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals are important steps in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever - reducing medication or other symptoms, and that the hospital leave policy is flexible to allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and for employees to know this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure - risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people unknown or allegedly suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of transmission in the community around the business location, or because someone has just recently traveled internationally to location with a large COVID-19 infection.
This group includes high-population volumes. Technical control for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-equipment air filters, increasing ventilation levels, putting up physical barriers like plastic sentries sneeze, and installing drive-thru or lantatur windows for customer services for this group. A high-risk control for this group includes encouraging sick workers to stay in their homes, replacing face-to-face, changing working interfaces with virtual communications, making a shift with a time/coming physical arrival with a non-residential arrival, stopping the location where COVID-19 is currently in progress, developinging emergency communications for employees to answer workers and the current risk of workers and behavioral training, and training workers using clothing and providing protection of environmental tools, and require a regular work work, putting access and careful work and waterwork work, and watering the workwork work, and watering of the surfaces, perhapss, or the surfaces of surfaces, perhaps, and using the surfaces of the surfaces of the surfaces of the CVIVVVlClClCARs, or currents, may include the computer devices.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect the worker and other passengers involves separating the sick from the sick at six feet, appointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews should wear an entirely-usual medical glove when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated bodily fluids or surface surfaces and perhaps another protective device if a sick passenger has a fever, a constant cough, or difficulty breathing.
Mittens and other disposable goods must be dumped in bio hazard bags, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and infected afterwards. and inform medical centers immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical studies are performed in the cabins of isolated people, regardless of the spread in the community, for school and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean up or disinfect if infected people have ever been in the school building.
If there is an infection in society at a minimum to medium level, social restrictions strategies can be applied, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, incremental arrivals and returns, restricting nonessential visitors, and using separate health locations for children with flulike symptoms.
If there is a high infection in the local community, besides social restrictions strategies, extending school closure can be considered for law enforcement officers who perform daily routines, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self - protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect the belt and task equipment before being used again by using a spray or a cleaning rag and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APDs and to control and wash laundry.
OSHA considers certain health and morgues to be high - risk or very high - exposure categories.
High - exposure work involves health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-procedure procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol - producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedure, bronchcopy, some dental procedures and checkups, or invasive specimens fetching.
High-risk morgue work includes workers involved in preparing the body of a known or suspected COVID-19 case at the time of death; this job poses a very high risk of exposure if workers perform autopsies. Additional techniques for this risk group include isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when an aerosol-producing procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure vents may fit in some health care and morgue settings.
Specimen must be dealt with with by biological safety precaution level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who arrive be separated into different waiting rooms based on the alleged COVID-19 case, besides other APD cases, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections, and people who perform aerosol-procedure procedures.
In the United States, the NIOSH - approved or better - approved N95 facial - covering respirators should be used in context of written and comprehensive respiratory - breathing programs that include tests of conformity, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comforts. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothing or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
For those who take respiratory specimens, care, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedural procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, capes, and gloves.
When the aerosol procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with an N95 respirator or FFP2.
In light of the insufficient supply of APDs around the world, WHO recommends minimizing APD needs through remote medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct care may enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only APD required for specific tasks, continue using the same respirator without letting go when caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Loosen the load and prepare the future
- March 14, 2020, =4 UTC
LOSENSION: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human connection and the responsibility that we have for each other.
We've never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all workmates by email, call, and conversation are the extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, which we have been fortunate enough, to work with them.
My infinite gratitude and pride can call you all co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their award for our work.
They reminded me of how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this vital resource to remain online for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure it keeps going, helps pay our colleagues, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially right now.
This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is an appropriate response to the challenges we face and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We desperately want to remove the pressure and support our mission for the long run.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set days off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been necessary to say, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO is not needed, simply inform your manager and help your team revised the calendar and schedules to make sure the primary jobs can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan inside T&C Ops that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management).
Fellows whose pay-based hours will be paid in full.
We've said it, and said it once again, to honor our commitment to fellow contractors and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on normal working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress toward the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, & Security Trusts, and Fund Building teams, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to assess our current goals and divert our focus to support the essentials to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most essential project.
Slowing down this time will be nothing to the future.
We don't plan to "work overtime catch up" after this pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet an unrealistic deadline at this time.
We realized that the situation had changed and would strive to set new goals and timelines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to new realities and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our point is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can give priority to important jobs, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodate their needs or want to work with less schedules over the next few weeks.
The extension of this timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegates and teams on the next step as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership on this.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to a COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antiviral cleaning crew to infect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They use hospital antivirus fluid to infect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety protocols using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We were happy that the office would be ready for use when we decided to return.
Our DC office is WeWork, which has distributed COVID-19 protocols to us and all members of staff based in D.C.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full long-range work order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based in NYC know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion continues, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long - term colleagues realize that this may require adjustments and they would like to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting at most an hour or two.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to split them into days.
Define the meeting clearly, set up an agenda, and send in the previous reading material.
Make video defaults, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chatter for questions and take down the list of speakers, and someone to help make the meeting notes (or make collaborative notes).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the work shared
SDM operations are searching for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increase in jobs distributed throughout the Foundation.
In recent weeks we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edit-a-thon, until WHO states the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our demand for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete approved grant activities and that no one would be granted the penalty for delaying or modifying the target.
Next week we'll follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and regional community conferences and other theme conferences.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be the sadness of the disorder, but at the same time it's relieved the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Forward, CRT is trying to set up pages in Meta-Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 others at Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are now significantly exposed.
If you have questions about travel, events, main line of work, or difficulties about coverage, or other matters that may require help, do not hesitate to share and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and to be the link according to the need.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Human Operations.
Let none of these changes be seen as a disregard for our jobs and obligations.
Instead, this change is a confession that, at this point, our jobs and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement needs, and give the world the service they rely on.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important work that's coming in a few weeks and maybe a few months.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can do your best when you need to.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M), and members of the other Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzim converter angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity contrary to the angiotensin (ACE) conversion enzyme, reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 override enzyme is a metaloenzim containing tin that lies on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
ACE2 proteins have M2 peptidase domain terminal-N and transporter transporter amino acid renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I passing membrane protein, with enzymeally active domains exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as the sheddase, and the soluted protein produced is released into the bloodstream and is eventually exported into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of the cell especially to the pulmonary alveolar cell type II, the small intestinal enterrocyte, the endotel cells of arteries and veins, and the smooth muscle cells are arteries in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The ACE2 primary function is as an ACE counterweight.
ACE broke the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensant II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino acid fenilalanin terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrates it into angiotentinen (1-7) vasodillator (H-Asp-Arg -Vyr-Tyr-His-Hes-Pro-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, applein, neurotension, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane traffic transporter amino acid neutral SLC6A19 and engages in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a major entry point into the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein binding on spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bumps with ACE2 enzyme domains on the cell's surface causes endocyteosis and virus translocation and enzymes into the endosom that lies inside the cell.
The entry process of this virus requires priming protein S by serin protease host TMPRSS2, which is being investigated today as potential therapy.
However, many professional communities and the regulatory agencies recommend continuing ACE and standard ARC therapy.
A systematic and metaanalysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant decline of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with strokes and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the decline in mortality related to pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of total pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinan humans (rhACE2) are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injuries, and it appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the pig with acute respiratory syndrome induced by poplicaride.
The human part-rhace2 period is about 10 hours with a 30-minute working receipt other than the 24-hour-long effect.
Some findings suggest that the classic rhace2 may be a promising drug for patients with an intolerance of renin-angiotensity systems or a disease with angiotensin II in blood circulation has increased.
The B'Application COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people who may have made contact with the infected.
Many applications are developed or proposed, with official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
The issue of privacy is questionable, particularly related to a system based on the tracking of the application's geographical location.
Alternatives that do not insinuate privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity with other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support this Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread apps that allow citizens to check if they have contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities in Singapore, used an app called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and give a quick response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, it was still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On April 12th, the government stated that contact tracking applications are in the advanced stages of development and will be available for distribution in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19 diagnosed patients who live in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that might occur on an application-based system, which includes a positive fake and possibly lack of effectiveness if the data taken by applications is limited to a fraction of the population.
To address the misoronaviral or dangerous spread of applications, Apple set limits on the type of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, which is limiting only to "resmi" organizations or who have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Private proponents voice concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether surveillance infrastructure created to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for boundaries on these kinds of surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on a government project:
surveillance must be "lawful, necessary, and proportional";
expansion of monitoring and surveillance must have sunset clauses;
data usage must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proved protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
each data division with a third party must be defined in the law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Partition means that all of my "relevant interests" are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of surveillance continuously by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system once no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy protected systems have been created and using central servers only for intercommunication (see below).
In South Korea, non-based systems are used to track contacts.
In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including data tracking mobile devices and data transaction cards, and combines this information to produce notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes that location information available to the public, which is permitted with a broad change in information privacy laws after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using both a central system and a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, details haven't been released.
Tracking privacy protection contacts is an established concept, with a large number of research literature starting in at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on a privacy friendly solution, such as using Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE), to record user proximity with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a decentralized and decentralized approach (DP/DP-3T), a temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Genesis Number, CEN), Protocols and Assestives of Privacy for Mobile Contacts, and so on.
In this protocol, Identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, platforms to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and use the location or data of the plot intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It was based on the study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of the data.
On April 5th, 2020, the global TCN coalition was founded by groups that had basically the same approach and were the most overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which was a major aspect of reaching wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had created a BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application to be an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS cellular platforms, announced initiatives for tracking contact, which they claimed would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and demographic technology that protects privacy.
They also published the specs of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to launch in three stages:
Launching tools to allow the government to create an official application tracking the coronavirus that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly into the iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address the problem of data harvesting and surveillance by first distributing the system through operating system update, and then deleting it in the same way after the threat has passed.
The drug b'Reposition (also called a new destination, a new profile, or a new task in medicine or a treatment transition) is the use of a drug approved for the purpose of new medicine, namely, for diseases or medical conditions that differ from the original purpose of drug development.

In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vakin COVID-19 was a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there is a lot of effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of this disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in the security study of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic spread around the world in 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use a published genome to develop a vaccine that may be able to fight SARS-CV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the thing that needs to be noticed in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, dispersion on the necessary scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientist reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine for COVID-19.
Target platform main advance to Phase I security study, covering:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others being announced, but with little public information available (conceived as being in planning or under design).
The phase I-II test did initial security tests and immunosis, usually performed randomly, placebo control, and in some locations, while determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates that were developed (confirmed early April 2020), 74 of them were not yet in human evaluation (still in "praclinical" study).
On January 24th 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronaviruslike particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for this vaccine is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. President, Donald Trump, had offered "' large sums of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was tested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German companies, BioNTech, to together develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the candidate for the mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is in praclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, in Italy, Italian biotech Takis Biotech companies announced that they would get preclinist testing results in April 2020 and that vaccine candidates in the final stages could begin to be tested on humans in the fall.

Another CEPI investment partner for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20th 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20th 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could amplify itself for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving sequencing from China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million fund for 96 medical relief projects on COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced the C$192 million in particular to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to set up a national vaccine bank containing some new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, the candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine, on mice; they stated that "MNA which gave the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine is causing a specific antigen antigen response that's coming up two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University School of Pharmaceuticals Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential spray nasal.
Using bacteriaofags, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless-like particles, which can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access the supercomputers of IBM, combined with cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologists, which are also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease that prevents them.
Further randomd trials in Australia are attempting to include 4,170 health workers.
It's possible that vaccines in development won't be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other lab animals, and nonhuman primates, shows the need for dam safety measures to achieve a level of biological safety 3 in handling living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine to SARS and MERS has been tested on nonhuman pet models.
Until 2020, there has been no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, existing SARS research was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine that completed the clinical test of phase I in humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdAx1-MERS, BVRS-GAMVac), and one vector-MVAVA (MVA-MERSS).
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was previously recognized and that vaccines were available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the common symptoms is about five days, but they can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases cause mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and compound organ failure.
Until April 17, 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have been cured. often through sparks or small droplets produced through cough, sneeze, or talk.
Even when breathing out, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not transmitted remotely.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
On the surface, it can last up to 72 hours.
The virus was highly contagious during the first three days after the symptom notice, although the spread may have occurred before the symptoms arose and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method was with the polymerase chain of reverse transcription of real-time (rRT-PCR) on the nasofaring userap.
Mask usage is recommended for people who are suspected of contracting the virus and those who treat it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some recommend not using masks, some recommend use, and others require use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmissions of disease have been recorded in almost every country in the six region of WHO.
A virus - infected person can be without symptoms or flulike symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and asphyxiation.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, constant chest pain or congestion, confusion, difficulty waking up, and face or blue lips; medical treatment is immediately recommended if these symptoms arise.
Respiratory symptoms, such as sneeze, snot, or sore throat can be found, but they are rarer.
Symptoms of gastrointinial, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in different percentages.
Some of China's cases were initially with a clinical image of asphyxiation and palpitation.
In some people disease can develop into pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
Reports indicate that not everyone infected has symptoms.
The role of the carrier without these symptoms in infection is not yet fully known; yet, early evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportions of infected people who show no symptoms are yet to be studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases are confirmed to remain without symptoms while in hospital care.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases without symptoms in its daily case on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large scale charge of the virus.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A Singapore study found that uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed as far as four feet [1.5 m] (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors stationed in the hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for virus RNAs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (RJP), can cause a single respiratory sequence to turn into an aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that viruses can spread through feses, these risks are believed to be low -- the most contagious viruses when people are involved; although the spread may occur before symptoms arise, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was discovered that viruses could be detected for a day in cardboard, up to three days on plastic and rustproof steel, and up to four hours on copper 99%.
Yet, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and detergen are also effective when properly used; soap products break apart layers of virus - protected fat, activate viruses, and release them from skin and other surfaces.
Other reducers, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconat (disinfekant surgeon), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after incubation began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest load of viruses, and the sixth patient showed the highest load of viruses on the second day of testing.
The coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 virus are on nature's related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, it was killed by domestic soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
Lung is the most exposed organ of COVID-19 because it accesses host cells through angiotensant enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most abundant cell alveolar type II lung.
It uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or bulge" to connect to ACE2 and enter host cells.
Acute heart injury was found at 12% of hospitalized infected in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of disease, but acute miocard injuries may also be related to an ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High-income trombosis incident (31%) and vein tromboembolism (25%) found on COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and possibly associated with bad prognosis. The autopsy on the dead because COVID-19 found alveolar damage infus (DAD) and infiltrat inflamation containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropicalism for epitel cell airways expressing ACE2, heavy COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
Specifically, T cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogenics prove to be correlated with monosites recruiting IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology on the COVID-19 patients.
Infiltrate lymphotics were also reported in autopsies.
WHO has published some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is a polymerase chain reaction transcription of real-time (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained through nasofaring intake; however, the sample of nasal or sputum usage can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken two weeks away, resulting in a small amount of time.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate this coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that labs around the world could develop an independent polymerase chain reaction test to detect infections by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (that can detect active infections and if one has been infected earlier) are under development, but not much use.
The Chinese experience with that test shows only 60 to 70% accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020, to be used at the end of that month, a diagnostic guide released by the Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggesting a method of detecting infections based on clinical images and risk epidemiological risks.
Ground-glass multilolateral opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving, and consolidation can occur as disease progresses.
A little data is available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 phophysiology.
The principal pathological findings on the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurition, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of virulence can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumosisic hyperplasia, large atiotic pneumotions, inflammatory interstitial infiltrations of lymphosytics, and the formation of many giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: Alveolar difus (DAD) damage with exudat alveolar difus.
DAD is the cause of acute and severe hypoxemia syndrome.
pneumonia in its healing stage: exudat arrangement in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibritis
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminata (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Precautions to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends shutting mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezeing and recommending the use of the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of a cloth mask in public, partly to limit infection by people without symptoms, social restrictions strategy to reduce contact with many people, by shutting down schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large - scale meetings in public places.
Restriction also includes a distance of at least six feet or six feet [1.8 m].
There hasn't been an effective drug known to prevent COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until the beginning of 2021, the main part of handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak epidemic, which is known as " flatten the curve."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after seasoning their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand-initiation containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-activatement is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria spores in alcohol; it's "not an active substance for hand antipsis."
Gliserol added as a humektan.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other exposed vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they're carrying a virus to wear simple facial masks.
The oxygenation of the extractoreum membrane (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failures, but the benefits are still considered.
Self - cleaning and lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The Chinese National Health Commission and the National Commission have published recommendations for treating people with COVID-19 who are treated in the hospital.
The U.S. intensive care expert and lung expert have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies to free resources, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend more paracetamol than ibuprofen for the first line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral infection, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand vents.
For health workers treating COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Udar Infection Isolation Room in addition to using standard precautions, contact prevention measures, and tular-air prevention measures.
Recommended tools are: APD robes, respirators or facial masks, eye armor, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on Emergency Usage Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against air-conceived particles like dust, but certain biological agents are not guaranteed for unspecified uses on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial armor or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not so heavy that they require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are hard.
The type of respiratory support for people who experience breath failure related to COVID-19 is actively being studied for inaptive individuals, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal canaules or bipositive air traffic pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these methods brings similar benefits to the sick.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive mechanical vents, if available, because these techniques limit the spread of aerosol particles compared with high flow canaules; heavy cases occur more in older ones (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital bed per capita, which limits the capacity for health systems to handle sudden surges in the number of cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to require incubation.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of those with COVID-19 treated ended up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
A ventilator capable of high-pressure control mode and PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumotoraks.
A high PEP may not be available on old ventilator.
Research into potential treatment began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs were being tested clinically.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
Volunteers recommended by WHO participated in tests of potential medical effectiveness and security, the FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalesen plasma as experimental care in the case of a person's very or very dangerous life.
The plasma convalecents haven't had the clinical study necessary to prove its security and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a cellular application to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their names and ID numbers.
This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If risk potential is detected, applications recommend not only self - quarantine, but also inform local health officials, the analithics are high on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the cell phone data of the alleged person who was infected with coronavirus.
That step was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed agregat phone location data to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed of a mobile phone operator that "40% of citizens still move around."
The German government hackathon weekend 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience pressure caused by quarantine, restrictions on travel, side effects of treatment, or fears of infections themselves.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Acquire social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline are perfect storms that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper - air respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Light cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may need three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection heavy based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the worst cases, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and cardiac, kidney, and liver damage.
Blood clotting disorder, especially protrombin time increase, is observed at 6% of COVID-19 patients who are treated, while kidney function disorders are visible at 4% of these groups.
About 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 images show increased liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the median time between the symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, the patient who was transferred to the ICU had a seven - day median between hospitalization and death.
In a study that studied early cases, the time of medians ranging from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men have 2.8% mortality rates, while women have 1.7% mortality rates.
A postmortem lung sample histopatological examination indicates an alveolar difus with exudative cellular fibromicoid in both lungs.
The cytomatic changes of the virus are observed in pneumotions.
Lung image resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage is observed, with increased levels of troponin or heart failure.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people treated have a built - in condition, medical and social resources, an area that can also affect mortality.
Estimated mortality of conditions vary because of the difference in the region, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The lack of light cases can cause death rates to be overcounted.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that took place in the past can mean that the mortality rate today is too low.
Smokers have 1.4 times as likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times as likely need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop in lung capacity 20% to 30% in some people who recovered from disease, and lung scans indicate organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive nursing syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known that previous infections gave effective and long - term immunity to people who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is viewed as possible to be obtained, if you look at other coronavirus behaviors, but it has been reported that there is a COVID-19 healing case followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a deteriorating infection, and not a reinfection.
It's thought to be natural and it comes from animals, through spreading infections.
The origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by transmission from man to man.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest recorded date of the symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The official WHO publication reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary according to territory and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and the character of populations such as age, gender, and health as a whole.
At the end of 2019, WHO set out the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for death by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed labs and U07.2 for the clinically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths or epidemiologically without confirmation of labs for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The ratio of deaths in case of deaths represents the number of deaths divided cases diagnosed at a specified interval.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of death to a global case is 6.9% (53.82/2,240.191) per April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the fatality of cases (CFR), which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the fatality of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected makes antibodies, the existence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epidemic episode in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Further, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as blood donors do.
69 people (0.004% of the population) are confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference of risk between new men and women not seen in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for these gender-based differences is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be an excuse.
An immunological difference based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and a man with comorphic conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were men and 72% of the people who died because COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not trace gender-related data for the COVID-19 infection.
Studies indicate that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Percentages of women's gender, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19."
WHO was the leader of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that the CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first outbreak to be identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e. g. Chinese), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for namings intended to prevent stigmatization. The virus that caused COVID-19 was given the name of acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory syndrome.
WHO also uses the COVID-19 virus and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, these viruses and diseases are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan's coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to 2015 guidelines that encouraged not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
COVID-19 and SARS-CAV-2's official name was issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health - care materials such as using nasal and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needs ventilator valves, and suppliers cannot provide on the necessary scale of time, a local company reverse-engineers and prints 100 valves that are needed overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false information, and disinformation arose about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animal.
Studies failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no cure or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International studies of vaccines and COVID-19 drugs are being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated "SOLIDARY Trial" to assess the effects of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-Cov and SARS-CAV-2 are both using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccine strategies under study.
First, researchers aim to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether the virus is inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine.
The experimental vaccines made with these strategies had to be tested to know the safety and success of its vaccines, and on March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. The progress has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There were over 300 active clinical trials that were under way in April 2020.
Seven trials tried to evaluate approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydrochromocuine or chlorocuine.
The new intended antivirus drug formed most of China's research, with nine phase III trials in remdesivir in some countries with a deadline for reporting at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of the development of clinical vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs exists. Some antivirus drugs are being evaluated for the COVID-19 treatment, which includes remdesivir, chlorocuine and hydrochloriclorokin, lopinavir/riminavir, and lopinavir/rivir combined with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was provisional evidence for the efficacy of redesivir.
Clinical improvements are observed in patients who are treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
A clinical trial of Phase III is being conducted in the U.S., China, and Italy, where Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with early results.
However, there was a call for a review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommends the use of chlorocuine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, records that doses double are dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an authorization for emergency use of hydrochromocin and chlorocuine on the policy of doctors who treated COVID-19. The 7th edition of China also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to use against COVID-19.
Initial data shows that high doses of Ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further studies in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations. Research suggests that pre-priming of protrouble proteins by serin protease transmembrand 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorocuine and hydrochromocin with or without azitromys has great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Cytokin storm complications can occur at advanced COVID-19 weight.
There's evidence that hydrocchlorics may have antisytokine properties, that Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
It's going through a phase 2 test at a national level in Italy after showing people positive results with severe disease.
Combined with the blood test of the ferrytin serum to identify cytokine storms, this drug was intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some of the exposed.
In 2017, antagonist of the interleukin-6 receptors was approved by the FDA based on a case study of retrospectives for treatment of cytokine release of a steroid refracter that was induced by a different cause, the therapy of the CAR T cell.
To date, no random and controlled evidence has shown that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring refined and classified antibodies produced by a COVID-19 recovery system to people in need are being studied as a nonvaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy was attempted for SARS with unconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the working mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy can provide a defense against SARS-CV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity depend on antibodies and/or phagocytes, are also possible.
Another passive form of antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, is in development.
The production of convalesen serum, which is a fluid part of the patient's already healed blood and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely linked syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who was then infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
