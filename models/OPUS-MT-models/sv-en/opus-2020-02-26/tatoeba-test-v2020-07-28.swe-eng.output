She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if Mary's words were true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever arrived or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna lie in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do that?
Give this to Tom.

Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.

I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What exactly was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There's no doubt who's being elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the Lord of the Ring Trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.

I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.

Nobody's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the parish.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father is healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you're gonna have to do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new energy.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're mad.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to speak to Tom for a moment.
He will fall into temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have different opinions from you.
Tom closed the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give in to my internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get into town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked with the main lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
That's got to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's hot, what?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before 2:00.
I am.
That's very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.

Unfortunately, Tom failed.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody's dreaming.

On my return, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.

Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?

What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I've got some great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're about to die.
This is not good.
I think you're right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It is certainly not worth the effort.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
I've got a steel bladder.
Have you heard from Tom?
We visited places of historical interest.
We're having steak tonight.
Tickets are only valid for two days, including the day they were purchased.
I have two foreign friends.
You might as well tell him in advance.
