It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that this animal's feather suit was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur springs do not have a well-developed shaft, so-called coil, but have other characteristics of springs - rays and rays - the researchers concluded that the coil was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the springs indicates that they were not used to fly but instead of temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen show an adult spring suit and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers said that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the test shows adult spring suit and not young down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that the research team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like the moon exerts attraction on earth, causing tidal tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The researchers managed to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview he said that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high level of mortality."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, of which at least two were hospital staff.

"They're cooler than the surrounding surface of the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caverns on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing at the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their elected candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach fairly strictly.
Since 1988 the ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted by the relevant voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every aspect of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers under extensive supervision are counted and follow specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group could not finish their rides and 45 out of the total 117 participating skiers in the big slalom did not manage to place themselves in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
"Vice Chief Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Detective Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services cut out the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in the Edinburgh sheriff's court of murdering her son.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but all eyewitness evidence can be useless because her picture has been published on a large scale.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University states that "journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images, etc. of suspects."
The Crime Office, which has the overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the leak is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the six-day war in 1967.
Other topics that are said to be reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while PA only agrees to leave such presence for five years.
Hunters in the additional pest control experiment would be closely monitored by park keepers, when the study was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new temporary electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth Provisional Elections Council in the space of four years.
Last month, a Commission of Presidents recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 misconstructed iPods overheating cases, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (Meti) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"The METI announced last week that Apple had informed 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "mild."
"The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of the Northern Mariana Civil Protection announced that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of the tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippines' hubu town.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six guesses, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an older lady because she needed toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetus' lung maturation.
"Xinhua reported that the government investigator salvaged two black boxes on Wednesday."
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Pretty unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin" "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she has better where she is now."
Of 1 400 people questioned before the federal elections in 2010, the number against Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view that Queen Elisabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, whereas 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swam 100 m and 200 raffle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his troubles there have been doubts about his condition.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain as they are forbidden in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the greatest known prime number so far, on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Kometers may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, entry into government earlier this year and signed last month a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
"He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that the planes fly shorter distances, save millions of litres of fuel each year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technologies as opposed to older ground radar-based technologies to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is set up, and trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
Fear of lack of means of transport opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwinfink, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwinfink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any form. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
"It can be done very thinly and attached to other metals. It can be done so thinly that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand painted images in books called ""lit manuscripts"."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage shifts the shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir together the two dry powder. Then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Wastewater systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket of over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope up in space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Under them there are more medium-sized cats eating medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet treasures) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it away from rivalling with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called flocks.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are often closely related; a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As a comprehensive athlete, the tiger can climb (but not good), swim, jump long distances and pull by five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (the family Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roaring is not like the lion's loud roaring, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (by changing) via the smell, by sniffing on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and even move very sneaky. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small stock) are separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily recover), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has other resources and competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speculation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant that there was no chance to escape for something that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasauri, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of weird or unusual parties such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called hazelmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half lie on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals cannot have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa or potatoes, and none of ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods considered to be the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziqqurates, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked food on the farm; shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic fairy tales, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and when he traveled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there already at the time.
"Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence.
That is not true, however, and although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a tax map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled together for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was only written there as a label.
The landings on day D and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the "Vichy" Frenchmen. These were French people who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allied South France invaded, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilization, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations; a civilised culture means that knowledge is transferred between generations, a lingering cultural footstep and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as real civilizations.
During the U.S. War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - according to the Confederacy articles.
The Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national exercising power or judiciary, it fell upon the authorities of the States, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all Länder before they could be added and the Länder attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan in the geographical sense is often regarded as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 14th century when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch Eastern Indian Company founded a base in Southwest Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the origin production of cereals and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signs the Shimonoseki Lecture, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then controls the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of Sol and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is its image ratio inherited to the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-milimeter format is, slightly confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The page ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to achieve the simplest full-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The highly abused and often ridiculed third rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in one picture.
It is argued that the best location for the subject is where the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion had bound European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main teachings of Christianity says that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain began a maritime blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the necessary military and civilian supplies, even if this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the last two hundred years.
The UK mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral vessels.
As a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most residents and countries.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, countries wanted to avoid such a situation being repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to start working at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage in China's history, or every family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided; the most famous of these periods were the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jindynastians.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in the battle to sit in the highest chair in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all seeking men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as rank in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to ponder."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know there is. Inside the cave it's total isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"Gizaplatån, or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of the Egyptian Death contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples and the great Sphinx."
The Cheops Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "marking for "upward-strike" looks like a "V" and the marking for "down-strike" looks like a staple or a square with no bottom side."
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means that you should start at the frosch (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow down.
A stretch usually generates a softer sound, while a downhill is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but bear in mind that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They went back to Paris in a cart surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting out threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their cart windows wide open.
At one point one of the participants in the mob swung his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
War expenditure on the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits deriving from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The epoch of time in which events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages as the period of European history in the 1000s to the 1300s.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from technology driving the development or technological imperative in the strict belief that man's destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are original, rather than social ones."
For example, it could be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography formed individuals and over time mores and culture arose related to this geography, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate at about the year 400 AD and continued until about the year 1100 AD.
Its influence declined during the 1300s mainly because of the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 1100-1200s and 1300s.
In the beginning clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, the styles of the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-supporting agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers ran self-sufficient agriculture and so it is still in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture that can be characterised by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical character, or may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate assault, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called "savages." Some wild children have been shut up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical impairments."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness all on their own.
When the wild child is fully raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to human beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals who learn something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage by himself.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not educational, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to offer all the necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of user theory.
"For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are proposed as important grounds for Internet use (James et al, 1995)."
"Also "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions on websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
In addition, a lack of this serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you usually turn off the watch in your sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room, so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic-based options involve drinking lots of liquid (especially water or tea, a known fluid driver) before sleeping, which means you have to go up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlated to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been extended by the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga brings the Kundalini energy (information energy) through yoga settings, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
God's yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in systems, process and culture led to the collapse of their cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
At 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland while at the same time violating the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Poland non-attack pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagrosbergs in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them to get milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgetter was usually held in squads wandering on hills or other pastures, often precipitated by shepherds who were often children or young people, similar to the more famous shepherd. These methods of flushing are still used today.
Trails for wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
Even though wagon roads only consisted of parallel wooden planks, the horses that drew them allowed them to achieve higher speeds and to draw greater loads than on the more severe roads of the past.
Grinders were introduced quite early to keep track in place. However, they gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This came to be practice, but the iron tore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails were completely iron was introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the righteous man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although Sahel anthropus may have gone on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases symptomatic treatment, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing works a few blocks away.
"During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on the farm in Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had it read to its troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 broad pages of Dunlap which are known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Inner poisoning is not always immediately noticed. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
The term rams are used in the formal sense of entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasite on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are resident, adapted to live in its host's nest or home.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the best interests of their children.
These couples can choose to draw up an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple may raise the child.
Science's main objective is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experiencing, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge in Greek diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological watches.
Periodic rhythms that are not only reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fager, or virus, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited in children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small country towns in cars to go to work and pass by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow linked with, and supports, a private car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable conditions that has supported human development over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. In principle, everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or breaking bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because preparatory work cannot be predicted with 100 percent security.
As well, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic tends to float on reasonably consistent and can be presented in general mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
Their ability to fly helped them avoid the enemy more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't trap their wings are dragonflies and daisies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second-longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times the size of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main channel is 6 387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids were never surpassed in Giza's size and construction technology.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has around 800 inhabitants; it is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
People have known of basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in nature in its original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that all consisted of one or more of four elements in total: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. There are of course also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillion of them can fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it came out.
When newer writing methods have been developed, unfortunately the pencil has been given lower status and fewer applications.
Today people write messages on computer screens, and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what becomes of the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to achieve a core of many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. To split the core again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable grains and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the hitter side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what triggers people or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized after they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their surroundings it is that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors may appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain the "one of the gang"""
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams keep the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their team can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The invisible team" is the management team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behaviour supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch in computer science that includes machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
Research within AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video games software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. Often, the teacher wants to take the students to places where buses do not go.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with its class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions may remain online as a clipboard book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
As students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the outside world. The requirement to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Suitable use of blogs" can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, and describe their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showing Canada's present and past.
Further south is Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more, Ontario distinguishes with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are close enough uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the territories, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered in the north by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (not only one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would regard as harassment, and it is not uncommon for anyone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up to you (cultural differences don't make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 1000s BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of crimps, but that all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located at the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is quite safe, but if you're going to visit outside Goma, you should look at what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote locations."
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was included on the list of threatened World Heritage sites because of the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the larger stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border to Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is Crocodile river.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each hosting different wild animals.
It is one of the biggest sights in South Africa and it is considered to be the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily nature conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong's territory its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The buildings on a row that make up Hong Kong's silhouette have been similar to a glittering bar chart reinforced by the water in Victoria's port.
To see the best prospects in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seaside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlements on Hong Kong Island are densely packed on the previous seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal manor belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian inland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remaining estates of the great jungles that once covered the Gangesslätten.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third are wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30 000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those on the way east and Jakar/Bumthang, go between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the distractions are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two passageways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian toll stations are expected to be ready.
Guaraní was the most important group of indigenous peoples who inhabited the present eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practised subsistance farming.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 16th century Paraguay was born, formerly called "The India's giant provinces," as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups from the native population."
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537 Paraguay has managed to retain much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is well known because their polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
This year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please turn to Associacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
GBP is usually received everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30°C
Winter can be fraudulently cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combined and makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison oxen, moose, candae deer, bears and almost all the big animals can go to attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also bear in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking food that smells and keeps the camp clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the location of Auckland between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost everyone is sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them the maori myrtle offers shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waimemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well visited family beaches with a good range of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one," which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may manage the journey better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso," cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Yet, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay great attention to safety warnings.
Cub jellyfish occur near beaches and close estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile lies in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Booking in advance provides the traveller with security and an assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close where things are happening, you have to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late in the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cab's location, because going through ice causes really horrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and pleasure to keep guests in good spirits and make them stay in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point may occur.
On icy and snowy roads friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards it can fall in a very short time enough snow for you to get stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowy or by condensation or ice on the window of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safari are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wild animals, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also known as "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days."
Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies related to the corona virus look different, but by the end of March most people do not go as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2,500 and 130 000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing of damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burning).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters may vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Harmful animals can destroy food, cause irritation or in the worst case allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other supplements in certain places.
Travellers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often goes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, drive with reason: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
The speed limits set are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbour in the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often especially suitable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and Pakistan's continental regions, yoghurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other subcontinent coastal regions, coconut milk is often used.
With 17 000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes scattered around the country.
But if it is used without words of determination, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now available everywhere in the Kingdom, offers a posse of simply spiced dishes, where the tasters that the Javanes use most are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanesian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbygels are support for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with a foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rods that ensure that a stirrup loosens from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large rocks and granite walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Execution skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you slide down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski tramps," who plan the whole holiday trip around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings that represent skiers are dated as far back as 5,000 BC!
Performing as a sport has existed at least since the 1600s, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, touring or skiing.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine skiing or rock climbing, the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cope with slightly greater distances than walking - but you only rarely get up at speeds like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries; in normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport checks on a number of occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions rather like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately. This saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other professions.
Even historically, however, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as bait animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
"Although it is often used, especially among non-romani, the word "gypsies" is often considered offensive because of its associations of negative stereotypes and erroneous perceptions of Romani people."
If the country you visit is the subject of a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also have requests to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may have different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel council is just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The picture presented is often hasty, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variants of them, which may be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation and wildfire are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, sky strokes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe blizzards, dizzy weather, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly recommended to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be regarded as a war zone should receive professional training.
"An Internet search for hostile environmental education" is likely to give the address of a local company.
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but much more detailed, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes gun training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex corrective surgery abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for their return.
The will of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The will of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Trans persons who have not undergone an operation shall not expect to be able to pass through X-ray check with integrity and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology means that the reflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents that lead to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back against current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you do not get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered, wait to be saved.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), going on longer and may be more serious.
Travellers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When returning from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travellers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding also to be necessary for travellers returning home.
Pyramids sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is Sphinxen, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids become enlightened.
The Southeast Islands, which were discovered in 1819, claim several countries, with the largest number of bases, 16 of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of Halvön. The largest island is King George Island with the community Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater to an active volcano constitutes a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt here together with the plateau and then return to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, with a highest peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile reception, a satellite phone can be your only option.
In general, a satellite telephone does not replace a mobile phone because it is necessary to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, which means that they can take a year off before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases, entering a Sabbath year course abroad can actually increase the chances of entering a higher education in your home country.
A fee is usually charged to register for these teaching programmes.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes really are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat of every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stop in Saint Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while you return to and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not different from the personal fear and dislike of other things that very many people have.
Understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear caused by discomfort to the unknown or by not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things with air cargo, it may have taken several days on some routes to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to scrounge out with a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of traveling anywhere quickly and conveniently. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any of the UN Member States.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
The third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red-caked roofs, the 18th century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual eight-faced church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It is worth wandering around half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach of the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its grandeur of Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 drives regularly to Sintra, with stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the amazing Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sacred House), a place world-famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass burial site and a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as gentiles.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as according to law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other facilities.
Common subway messages are only made in Catalan, but unplanned interferences are communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to survive in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is grown with dense forest, mainly with beech, spruce and noble spruce, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large species richness, due to the magnitude of microclimates, different soils and varying height differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and feather are there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
The same logic requires men to dress in pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan food, like that in similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses consistently olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a large initial letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowels.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr different: caro means loved ones, while carro means carriage.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help in learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this base book in grammar.
It will of course be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their time of greatness was not the kind of problem that they are today, they are usually found in cities or in university areas, easier to reach than those built during modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of the cherry bloom, has been part of the Japanese culture since the 700s.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.

Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its placement in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you have to handle both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often)."
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit the castle in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a tour along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been taken up by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Night Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight the church then breaks up to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and therefore the giant turtle became the primary grazing animal of Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be used to.
Suit is the normal business outfit, and colleagues appeal to each other by last name or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where emphasis is placed on joint efforts rather than on the performance of individuals.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without doubt.
