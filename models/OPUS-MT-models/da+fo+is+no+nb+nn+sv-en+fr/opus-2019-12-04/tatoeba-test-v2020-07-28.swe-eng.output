Thanks for helping me fix the car.
Get off my lawn!
Stay close.
I'm gonna need their help.

I hate to be late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's it worth?
I'm happy to do it.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Let's dress up the Christmas tree.
What were you looking at?

Welcome!
It wasn't amazing.

Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.

Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
People sit on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She felt like we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we went over the ice.
Why doesn't Tom ever visit us anymore?
That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
You don't care?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
My knee hurts when I bend on it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go right now.
Tom snuck down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a reading plate for Christmas.
She plays hockey on weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember it the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Piglet.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
I don't know if the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna lie in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.

Try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom proposes, unless someone else has a better idea.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom beat Mary.
You should have liked it.
I've got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's having a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan anyway?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the Ring Trilogy story?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, golden brother.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't let me down during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The sex of the test cabins ringed through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back in the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom set me up.
Tom's helping.
One morning, he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the sock.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father is well.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll have to do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I had a lot of mosquitoes.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk a little bit with Tom in the middle of four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the train stopped, the train accelerated fast.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions from you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give in pay for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked with the headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
No one here is called like that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
That'll have to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before 2: 00.
I am.
That was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.
About 4.9 per cent of Finns are Finnish Swedes, i.e. people with Swedish native language.
Unfortunately, Tom got in trouble.
What's the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody's dreaming.
The flour is made of wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd feel better.
When I got home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.
Christ is resurrected!
I need your opinion.
I've had a rough afternoon.

I don't see anyone.
The more you get to know her, the more you'll like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
