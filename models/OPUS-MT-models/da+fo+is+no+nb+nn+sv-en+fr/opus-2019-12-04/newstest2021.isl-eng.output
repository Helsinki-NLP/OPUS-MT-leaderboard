The marketing campaign looks like You Need Iceland has gone well and yell and cold out in the nature are going to pull in people wide and wide across the world.
"You have a sense of intelligence, I need Iceland," says a woman outside in the big world in the eye of an advertisement from the marketing campaign look like you need Iceland on YouTube.
Another audience will say goodbye to Iceland in the heart for all eternity, and a young woman will say straight to the end of Iceland that her beloved will be settled there.
However, in all unhappiness, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for another month.
One more speaker asks if the path to Iceland is good, for there are no airplanes.
Do not follow the story if it comes from another time belt.
The Honeyson of the Peel Advertising Office, which was launched in conjunction with the M & C Saatchi International Advertising Office, says receptors have been expected further.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland-tours that went very well but this new journey is already going to strike meth.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it's getting the foreign media to rock around the campaign, and it's been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received around seven hundred media across the world, reaching a total of two billion people.
The value of this region is valued at 1.8 billion crowns.
It's not disgusting. "
The main market is the United States and has been very well off there, although the Americans are not on the way to the country in a hurry.
That the history of Egil has known the marketing areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany has also taken well, like Russia, which is a surprise.
There have then been reactions from outside areas, such as India, which were not specifically associated with.
"These advertisements have gone far but we expected," says Egill, but it may be that over four million people have looked at the substance on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better beginning."
The pictures here on the opening took the Year of Seaberg, the morning magazine photographer, to take the advertisements that carry the "Let It Out" headline in the middle of the last month.
The bars went forth wide and wide, as in the forest-gardens of Reykjavík, in the field of Reynish, in the forest-forest, in the temple of the temple, and in the cave of the head of the heart.
The captain of the play was Samuel Bjarki the son of Peter, and Gunnar the son of Paul the son of Olafh, of the Scottish producers, and of the captor of the Son of God, Otter.
As part of the conference, the Islandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary, played a role.
Thousands of Islandswere announced, but at the same time as the recording took place in the south, there was another group in the West and in the West.
The story of Egils is "Let It Out" only the first page of the Looking Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is planned that the winter campaign will work with M & C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this job for the Icelandic Agency," says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M & C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
"It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have a partner with knowledge of the range of things we are talking to. "
Programming: Discussing the position of the labour market, life expectancy and many more
Mr. Einar Dadson's assistant, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Welfare, will be here at Sprengisand, which will begin at 10: 00 a.m. today at the Bylgånden.
He is also a jobseeker and talks about the position of the job market as such, the Icelandair case and more issues.
He also talks about rural development and transport to countries that have gone badly and have been dealt with in the past years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman of the VR, will also appear in the show, but he will discuss his findings on the investment of the Lifestyjö and suggest the idea that the labour market movement and the employers withdraw from the government of the world to reduce the risk of economic activity.
Then shall they speak unto Ivar the son of Ingimar, the servant of the journey in the east country, and unto Årnhei the daughter of John, the chief captain of the company of the north country, at the place of the journey in the country.
They will look at the head and wonder whether the success of the summer is a deluding prediction of what is to happen.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10: 00.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later.
The playwright Elisa Donovan had a great holiday in the youth show of every kind.
The world-famous thing, though, was for her play as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
A little has been applied to her lately, but she was given to look over the road and speak about Clueless in the passion of television in the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
"I have to admit that I built the person the greatest of the girls I met in school that was not good to me.
As soon as I read the script I knew who this person was, "said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after a night stay.
About 50 cases came on board the police in the main city area today and said in the police journal that the cases were multiplying.
The day at the police station on Road Street began by regulators had to have been replaced by a man who had been recently released from prison after having stayed there due to an emergency.
The man would not go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to go away.
The man won a continuing stay at the police station because of his progress.
At that time, a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of breaking into a company in Kopovogi.
Legislative rules also required the transfer of two human beings in the Bredholt due to reports of physical injury.
Then came also that a woman who sat in a shopping centre in Kopovogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
They also reported a stolen car in the city this morning.
And Renault, a great white man, looked at her for a moment, and was taken away by an innocent hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The curse of the Glorious Party - the terrible fate of the Glorious Stars
The theory has reached flight on the Internet to curb the party of the Happy Society, but the actor Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and became there with the third major players to leave life far ahead of age.
The elements of the happy party (e-Glee) are friendly events of singing, dancing and rejoicing.
The children of the children of the children, their love, and their desolation, are the things of the multitude of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children, and the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the
It wasn't always taken out with the seldom to be in the happy party, but through the song and dance seemed the people of the subjects get to overcome each of the conditions that came up in their lives.
But outside the camp, there has been a lot of hardship over the players and the staff of the participants, so much so that theories have awakened about cursing the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera went with the role of Saint Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all his grandmother.
After the party had run its spoon, Rivera went to have the actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and one child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against his husband, and then left them behind.
Dorsey, however, refused to bring charges and was the home violence force made fall.
The 8th of July last time was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Pira's water in California.
The boy was found asleep in the rescue heritage on board the boat and he could report to the police that he and his mother had gone to the beach and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never left himself there.
Started a massive search for Rivera.
The day after the search started, the police officer in the area reported that we were looking for Rivera to have drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found, and was officially deceased.
It is believed that she has fallen into a lot of power in the water and has used its last demands to save her son.
Cause of death was reported drowned by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith went with the role of Finn Hudson in the plays, the American football player with the angel row who played the key role in bringing the Joy team to the wall and respect.
Outside the elements, Moneith, however, glanced at the personal Devil.
From the age of 13, he had a glance of addiction and found it difficult to get away from her.
In 2013, his associates were found enough in the show, intervened in and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look to better ways.
Only two months after he finished the treatment, Moneith was found dead in the hotel room after going out to have a good time with friends.
Banamine was found to be a fatal mixture of herbal substances and alcohol.
It was not thought that the will was to be done.
Moneith had gone into treatment and his tolerance for the generators had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well, was fatal.
He was only 31 when he was alive.
His spirit laid heavy on his associates, but to support his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to keep taking the shows on and sanctified the whole part of the memory of Moneith and his person found.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and carried little respect for his colleagues in the Joy Club, or all until he worked hard to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of child pornography.
At his house, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter was soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was prosecuted and charged with his crimes.
He had four to seven years of imprisonment over his head, and he had to be on a file of sex offenders looking for child care.
Before the judge had determined the punishment was found Salling, who was then free from insurance, left near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell from far ahead of age.
Jim Fuller was the director of the show.
He got killed in his sleep in 2013, only 41 years of age.
We also worked for a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of Julius Roberts, and she didn't carry her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great manpower and disobedience.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she was looking at severe depression.
She left herself a letter to her fiancée, where she said that her mother and sister among them was responsible for what happened to her.
"My mother and my so-called sister have nothing to do with me, except the memory that they were the ones who were the worst of my depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
Recently, she has been accused of using her handlers alone and override at the control point and being with a superior star stealer.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and sentenced for an accident in 2019, which took a great deal of insolence.
Heather Morris's playwright played a big part in the show.
In 2010, she was the first to see unprinted computer troopers in her nucleus and published on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the plays and had a relationship of love outside the plays.
Benoist later found out that Jenner had committed violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and swim.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel suggests.
Just having a moment with the kids in the park is something that's never forgotten.
They shall remember the flowers, and the fire, and, of course, the glorious time which they had with their parents.
Buying a boat after the 10th grade
"I don't think we are many sailors working in the playgrounds of the land," says Axel Eagle of the Son of God, who is hunting in summer, but who is studying psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter. "
Beach hunting is a very comfortable summer job when you're in class.
If well fished, you can have good roofs and I think it's great to be able to let go of a student's salary.
The magicians also do me well into the winter, "says Axel Eagle the Son of God, 25 years of psychology, who is hunting on the beach in summer, as in the past.
Axel was newest to a dock at Tälkapstället when the reporter spoke of it late at the beginning of the week. "
"The winter that I was in the tenth grade I took captain's rights for a boat that is under 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished the basic school.
I've been hunting on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, Harthman of the Son of Jonah; and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very excited when he saw that the boat carried his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, "says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer but the other half at the end of summer when I had been hunting.
I therefore had the boat unindebted at the end of this first summer on him. "
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had a new school?
"I had already spent and collected me money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat. "
Axel is born at Isaiah, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
"I may hunt here in the west area because I have a legal home with my grandmother at the Isaiah.
I learned in this area right here in the West of rumors with my dad.
I will go in between, according to how I am: for this field of hunting shall pass over all the coasts of the West.
Although I feel the best way to be west, I've also hunted around the Snepheline and wide.
I have also given for the south but they prefer to cry, "says Axel, who always ranks one fireman in the morning and says sometimes talk to things and sing for the sky, for the one and only hours together in the ballroom.
"The net connection out on the ocean is good, so I can call, listening to the charge elements and music.
I don't think it's a good idea to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid going to college, but certainly occasionally something has been to weather, but never much risk, "says Axel, who is lucky with that he is never nauseous.
He says the length of the day of work depends on how the hunting goes each time.
"In the sea hunt I am never more than 14 hours on a hunt at once, but I have also been hunting in other systems, for example in the hillside, but then I have been continuous for one and a half days in a bit out on the sea to hunt."
He says he can hunt 770 pounds a day, as he feels hampered.
"Other inhibitions are that I may not hunt Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, this four months that the sea hunters pass, in May, June, July, and August.
To my judgment, sailors should choose their days of hunting according to the weather, and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to be calmed instead of having 48 days over the summer and can choose according to your head.
So may the land change go on me too, and sea space that is well positioned at the fishing system should enjoy it, "says Axel, who drains the most dry of the salt sea on his coasts, but also only rough and unique other types of river with.
Axel is working over the winter with the high school at the school of Nupi in Kopavogi.
"I don't think we are many sailors working in the playgrounds of the country," says Axel proud and adds that he was only meant to work temporarily at the playground.
"I'm stuck there because I feel like this terrible job.
I hope that the psychology program will take advantage of me at the school stage in the future, "says Axel, who is also a long way from studying business science.
An error in the file prevented homecoming
An error in the record sheet that people fill out when it comes to the country was caused by the fact that a person, settled in this country, was not called back in a sample file.
It is not required to file a lesson number if the person fills the waste paper out in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says a specialist in the field of protection of the countryside.
Three internal transmissions were detected in the National Hospital of Virology last night.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of so-called homecoming took effect.
Those who were in Iceland are ordered to come to the land, and are called again in a sample four to five days later.
On the other hand, it was noted in the RUV lunch news that the person concerned would have gone by the old system.
The specimen on the border was negative and he was not called back in the screen for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdotten, a specialist in the field of national protection, says in a conversation with the newsroom that this can be attributed to error in the electronic record.
If people were to fill out the registration sheet in English, it is not necessary to insert a teaching number as is in the Icelandic version.
It has been thought of first and foremost for other travelers.
Therefore, the person concerned has not been automatically invited to attend the sample.
Kamilla says, however, that many people have followed the rules of homecoming even though they have filled the record form in English and, in some cases, employers have also been alert to sending people back to the sample after it came to the country.
"This will be examined during the week how to facilitate the accessibility of people to this raising their attention to the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been put in discomfort.
They all go to the sample, but two were showing signs.
Infection is now in progress with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is mostly closed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the stratification of the Icelandic genome analysis has shown that there is an anomaly of the coronary virus that has not been detected previously.
In the second case, the bonds have been made clear that Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also travelled to another European country.
Kamilla says it should be in the morning where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to COVID ice.
135 are in an emergency.
Four out of five non-connected infections
Five internal infections have been detected in this country in the past few days.
Of them, four are completely unconnected and are to form not to have found the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup athlete last night.
Infection is still in place.
Originally, there was a very rare third-year transmission in an infected population, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in an infection caused by these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that transmission is detected on athletic activity and has raised questions about whether or not such events are not present.
Johann K. John's son, the director of the communication of the general government, says it well slowly, as long as people follow the rules and the rules.
"We are constantly wrestling to all those who here have to keep up the individual transmission.
We also need to point out to people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then it is possible to hold an event, "says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by holding the air of individual infectious agents.
The rules and criteria are in addition to a constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Public Service and the National Health Service are constantly wrestling for people, it is to be borne in mind that this individual infectious agent.
Both homemakers and so on with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the infection from continuing, "says Johan.
"We need to make sure that people continue on the good road that we were on, in order to keep up the success that we have achieved."
40% of COVID-19 sacrificial lamb had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard in the phone how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Respiratory distress caused by coronary virus infection occurred suddenly.
Diabetes were listed on the death certificate as underlying issues and Brumfield, which is also diabetic, is also fearful of having to do so.
Reuters' news show says the fear of Brumfield doesn't have a reason.
Numbers of new studies conducted by the US authorities show that 40% of deceased patients had diabetes mellitus 2 as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases to half.
Study of the United States PSC (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronary virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not at all for those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
The growth rate of Reuters was slow and showed the responses from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
Ten countries, but among them are California, Arizona and Columbia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
"Diabetes mellitus was at a slow rate of growth.
Now COVID - 19 has broken into such a powerful age, "Reuters has after Elbert Huang, head of the Centre for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago High School.
Diabetes are more common among black and people of South-American origin, which have also become worse out of the coronary virus.
One of the best precautions for people with diabetes mellitus 2 is to keep the disease in line with their physical, dietary and healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus has made many difficulties in keeping routine.
In this case, high insulin levels have been required for some to continue to work and to stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters indicates that the US authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes mellitus 2 may have derived from the virus.
When the SARS coronary virus passed in 2003, there were more than 20% of the patients with the disease and in the 2009 swine fever, this group was at three times higher risk of hospitalisation.
In 2012, at the time of MERS, one study showed that 60% of patients who died or were hospitalised had diabetes mellitus.
Charles S. Share Cruz's scientist at Yale University says that because the effect of the COVID-19 virus could be longer then the age has swept the cover of the number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, the president of the international community of diabetes.
Physicians have observed that the coronary virus deficiency could have an indirect effect on increased complications of diabetes mellitus, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
As well as recent studies to enable the coronary virus to lead to an increase in diabetes mellitus.
Reuters says scientists are trying to distinguish the relationship between the coronary virus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus affects the heart, lung and kidney, an organ that is already sick in many people with diabetes.
In this case, high glucose and lipids rates in diabetes may result in the probable "cytomatic storm," as is called when the immune system responds too strongly and attacks on the body.
Emollient endocrine cells may also lead to inflammation which may again cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle game," says Dela Cruz.
"This is all about the government."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, so they came out of the room."
The husbands of Ásrún Magnus Daughter and Atli Bollason became the unusual prayer of the cinematographic artist Ragnar Kjartan Son to have sex in front of a camera for the artist's work being put up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Therefore, Atli Bollson will never forget when he met his wife and grandmother, Asruna Magnusdaughter, for the first time.
"I was very happy with her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then I thought she was pretty, too.
And I'm still sorry, "he says.
Asrún also remembers the end of the husband's first meeting regularly.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last weekend, "says the one who also attracted the husband at the first presentation.
"I felt and felt so much excitement around the Atla, as I faint.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen and I loved it. "
Atli says those husbands have stressed it in their relationship to go their own ways.
"We don't tie our backs to the same knots as the comms.
We avoid routines that we detect around us. "
There is a possible reason why they took the product from Ragnar Kartans son of the cinematographic man just celebrating, although that would be more than unusual.
"Kristin Anna, our mutual friend, is in contact with us and asks if we can have dinner with him, Ragga and Ingibjörgu Ragnar's wife, at Snaps."
And they received the commandment, and met with the third ridge of Snaps, and received deservines, and their deservices, and their deservices.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his idea of a cinema show which he thought would be set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris around the head.
"He had a multifaceted video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it simply. "
Asrún says he has described the work as a banal and decayed messenger from the everyday lives of the West.
"He had sketches of all the tendons he was going to shoot, and the last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in."
The senator that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show young millimeters to be loved in a minimal room.
"These are intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.
Paridad didn't know much, though they knew of him and he of them "but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They said they didn't want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who got sexual prostration from performing for others. "
They told Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we got rid of Snaps, we said," Aren't we just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his company, "says Asrún and Atli.
"This is about love and kindness."
The Senan was picked up in a nice apartment on the Myrtle Street.
There was a very few cinematographic team there; a handyman, Ragnar and a singer and the pair.
After the lights had been on, all the rooms left to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asrún.
"We hadn't decided what we should be like.
We got a little bit of guidance, but we tried to forget about the moment and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and what we were doing for each other.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated, "says Asrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, this was a little romantic," says Atli and Asrún.
"We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris. "
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved with them.
"When Tommi the takerman looked at this, he cried; he felt it so beautiful," Atli said.
"This is as much about love and kindness as it is about the relations themselves," says Asrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and say to Atli that his mother has heard the voice of the son of Reykjavik, and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to plague in this," Atli says.
"Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't said this to anyone like that, but then my dad just sent me a message saying, "Nice to hit the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," says Asrún.
And I wonder if the accomplice of the work has deepened the relationship between Asruar and Atla.
"At least we're still together so maybe this deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the community, "says Asrún and laugh.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I felt a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says and turns to the husband.
"But it was fun to see this because this is only one late in much bigger work and when you saw this with the other effects, this is really great.
I could wear something away from this, and I was just proud.
And there was little prayer in my belly, saith Asrún, which was barren of another child of the husbands when the tendon was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them, Asruna and Atla, in love stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous paradigm game
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the background pages of the game to get up in the English selection department.
The game went to Swansea in Wales.
The position in half was 0-0.
Swansea residents had a week in 64 minutes, but Andre Ayew failed the boklist of the White Point and defended him.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, actor Brentford, got the red card.
Brentford therefore played the remainder of the game less and in 82 minutes the players Swansea took advantage of the crew.
Andre Ayew improved the whites by scoring a great goal and guaranteed Swansea 1-0 wins.
Swansea will lead 1-0 to the singularity, but the second game will take place next Wednesday on the Brentford home.
Five years from the year 2009.
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American emissary in Iceland, is in a public broadcast after CBS reported it this morning that he wanted to get armed bodyguard where he feared about his life.
However, the President of the United States has not been able to command the ambassador here in the country without hesitation.
From the time Carol Van Voorst graduated from the United States of America in April 2009, he's been without a gentleman in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst was reinstated in specific circumstances, but Kastløs reported 2009 that she should have received the Fälkaord.
As soon as she met the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President's office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's deputy came to work, in September 2010.
There may be some reason why Robert S. Connan had been ordered as a ambassador, but then stopped.
At the end of the job, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for the past decade.
He then resigned from his post in 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then took another mission-free period.
Robert Barber agreed with US Congress in January 2015 and came to office shortly later, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a politician, but not a diploma, but he had served as a lawyer and short the election of Barack Obama.
He took off his duties as soon as Donald Trump took over the President's office, January 20th, 2017, as usual with a political-ordered ambassador.
The board of Trump was unusually responsible for both the ambassador and high-ranking officials on the Washington government system.
That's why you spent two years until U.S. Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the cards and confirm that at the end of the day as a ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the Senate, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to West Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of the Dutch rock broken.
Gunter is a political commander, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been a member of the Jewish community in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is an important supporter of Donalds Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is both how long the control of Trumps was to nominate people in the keyboards that have been working for the United States in recent years, including the confirmation of the ambassador's office.
From 2009 onwards, Iceland has been free of charge for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the operation of the network that opened the new headquarters at Engategi.
The operations are estimated to have cost approximately 6.5 billion, but the safety walls of the building are closed and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished to be given an armed bodyguard.
Former actor IBV became racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former actor IBV, says he has become racist when he was in Iceland and that he sees that he has come to the country.
This is an interview with Tonny, who appears at the Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing at the top of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in the country but he played with IBV, Val and Trot on Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I did not play in the middle like I was used to playing.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he was also with the trust number that I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted, "says Tonny, but he played on the right edge of the game with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is the racism he's become in Iceland.
He says this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
"This came to me once, but as I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Then I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
Then he told me that my adversary had made a racial reference fall upon me after I had given him the power. "
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
That's where he says he's made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to get to Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the country.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined them with Val.
"It was a mistake to come to Iceland again on a loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the opportunity that I wanted, "Tonny says, but he was hoping that if he would play well in Norway he would probably come further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has been made because of his dreams of getting into Europe.
Find a snake in a woman's neck
The doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 centimeters of long black snake in the neck of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a string.
A study revealed the presence of parasites.
CNN will explain this.
The woman had eaten a few days before Shashimi, which is a thin meat-snare.
The woman improved soon after the snake was removed, but parasites such as this are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rooted to bed in the West, cases of parasites being transported in people have increased to the story of CNN.
Fear of the start of other waves in Europe
The Spanish is now in a fireplace with concerns about the second wave of the coron virus in Europe, but the government has taken steps to reset the spread of the coron virus.
In Catalonia, all life of fun has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are spreading.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom everyone has to go to a hospital at the Spanish home, as in Norway, and France has been protected by travel laws to Spain.
The number of infections is also increasing in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance to curb the spread of the virus and restore the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good in comparison to elsewhere in the world, but the prevalence of infection in the world is close to 300 000 per day, but most of which is considered to be contagious in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has become 16 million in the world, according to John Hopkins University, and are deaths confirmed to be related to the virus, 644 thousand.
The Mosaic work is finally able to enjoy itself to the fullest extent
In front of the Customs House of Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
At the top of it are men with orange helmets.
There's a big grave there, too.
And more of my workmen.
The gate is closed before passage.
But the gangsteth is few, and there are many, and are worthy of the works of art of millions of Mosaics - as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it doesn't matter.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it there were parking spaces that were always seated.
People set up there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their business in the middle of the city.
"Living and multifunctional public space" and "Adequate bourgeoisie" are the guiding elements of the realisation of the current Security Act.
The goal is to celebrate the area and allow mosaic work to be done by the saint in the Customs House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work, there will be squares and, as the area is well at sunlight, it is thought to be a dormant area for road users.
The art work will be described and the substance will now be able to enjoy it better than before on this 142-metre surface.
In the area there will also be a small "blurred spray," some kind of water sculptures that offer a game and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the replacements are described by Reykjavikurborg, which is being carried out in conjunction with Vetu.
Allowed water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the school and cold food fields are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the centre of the century.
When the street is re-opened at the end of the day, cars can drive around it again.
But she will be the one street and, at the same time, she will be more comfortable and more accessible space for walking.
In the photo of the Customs House on the Customs Manager's web, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Gisli Halldórs son.
Due to the fact that the shaft was penetrated through the house, 250 square meters of window-free wall spots were formed out into the street.
The building board and architect agreed that such flags would have a bad impact on the overall street image, unless special measures were taken to impress the appearance of the house.
The main elements were therefore agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent art work there.
At this time, much of the words of the Statue of the Holy Father, an artist's woman, went into the summary.
Had she worked very hard on the mosaic work in Germany and wide.
It was agreed to first contact it before deciding whether the subject would be competitive.
Often the work had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the bay, and the halls had been born to Reykjavik since it was done.
When she was talking to the artist, she had to take the thought of such a work.
Had to agree that she received drawings and other assistance before going back out of the country, where she would work on the proposals of the United Kingdom.
The work got the time that she decided herself to need, and when she returned home she made a few suggestions until discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
In addition, it was requested to make a full agreement with it and the famous art works in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, but it had long been working with them on the design of the famous art works across Europe.
And the work of art was done, and the work of art was done in the work of their brethren, who were then in charge of the installation of the customs house.
All the work was exceptionally well done, both of the half-Saints and Oidtman brothers, says in the summary.
Since then, there has been an unmixed Icelandic bet.
It took about two years to do the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the end of the Tullhuset pain, only 47 years old.
Subsidiarity of transporting more agencies ashore
Einar Daddaason County Councillor asks that more official agencies be transferred to the country next.
That's what the Councilman of the show said at the Burgundy on lunch.
Recently, the Burns of Housing and Humanities Agency has been reported to be moved north of Lake Crop in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of fire-fighting work at the Agency but none of them intend to follow the Agency north and have the National Liaison with the Disarmament and Disarmament Service (RSPs) in a reliable way.
"I think we should step further in this being.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
Further transportation, "said Asmundur.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of official agencies across the country.
"I think it needs to take more political decisions about the transportation of official jobs out on land, as I was doing with the Housing and Mankind Agency," said Asmundur, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been moving out on land and changed a lot of matters for communities out on land, such as the transportation of Food Agency to Self, the Landscapes of Iceland to Akraness and the business security of Skagasstrand.
All the most important things from the second day Master's meeting
94. The championship of Iceland in free sports ended today at Torsvelli in Akureyri.
Some opposition was set up on the second day of the race.
It was calculated with an exciting competition in the slightest women in Torsvelli, but Vigdiis Jonsdott from FH put Iceland in the sounder in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Ruth Runar's daughter from IRR was added to May last year.
Vigdís returned to Iceland earlier in summer and has been in fantasy in the last time, but she has tripled the Islandmätt which is of some.
Elisabet Ruth has been sighting for injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdiis threw a long time all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and set a resistance.
Her island mate she used to sit in July is 62.69 meters and she was, however, somewhat away from it.
And the daughter of Karitah the king of Halim of IR had the second best battle of the day, but she had the greatest success, with the throw of 50.18 metres.
In the race of men, the FH-man Hilmar Eagle the son of Jonon, an Icelandic man in the battle, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next throw, and set a resistance.
His Islandsmanship is 75.26 meters.
The god of Valur the son of God, the father of Olyphus, and the captain of the island, in the oracle of Torsvell, in the oracle of Torsvell; and today he was in the oracle of his head.
The island of the Gods of Val is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and assured himself the victory.
Valdimar Halti Erlendson threw the second time today, but he had one valid cast that made the second seat, 49.43 meters.
The captain's daughter, the long-range captain of the island, won the long-distance jumper with overruns, but Hafdis jumped at a distance of 6.25 metres today, which is 40 cm from the coast of the island.
In the 200-metre course of women, it was the IR-inningar of the Goddbjerg Jonah Bjarnadott who was the most harsh but she came into the field in 24.04 seconds, but her Islandsmet in the article is 23.45 seconds.
And Jonah was a victor in Akureyr, and she made two gold prizes yesterday, in a hundred meters of course, and in a four times a hundred meters of course, and also in a four times a hundred meters of course today.
In the race of men, Kolbeinn the Son of Gunnarch was the first of the FH in the course of 200 metres, in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Mána Samúel's son of Årman.
And as the bear of God Jonah, Kolbeen made gold in the hundred meters yesterday, and in the 400 meters of the course.
Not given for 27 million Crop Bitcoin Reception
The tax authority has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who was required to charge a person for the miscalculation of its financial instruments that were available because of the sale of the Bitcoin video.
The committee finds that the tax commissioner would not have been able to explain why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
In the assessment of the Board, it is concluded that the tax director considered that the man was in a position to understand the material wrong tax estimates for the 2016 and 2017 years.
He would have misrepresented his financial tools that were available because of the sale of the Bitcoin power coin up to 27 million, either willingly or by enormous loss of strength.
The city of the man for his solitude.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he walked by selling electricity coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had it in 2009 and 2010 when it had been both easy and unexpensive with normal home life.
Then he suggested that when he sold the electric coin, tax performance due to such sales would have been highly unpredictable and unpredictable.
It would have been most likely for the general public to be aware of such measures in tax matters.
He would not have been able to get away from paying taxes on the harvest and would have made an account of his property on the bill as an instability to the bill of payment.
He would have asked both the acquaintances and the Treasury about how this was done, but without success.
Then he thought he needed to consider that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to present complex rules which the tax authorities would not have made clear their views on.
The man thought the right thing was that his taxes for these two years would be re-determined and burdensome, but otherwise no punishment.
Then he said that he worked in Iceland and had paid tribute to this country since 2012.
He never intended to get away from his duties in a disobedient manner.
The charge of guilt would be all over the place and would stall him into debt.
"This man understands what football is."
Andersen Willumsson's armor has been significant between the teeth of the people, but also awakened the mood for the progress of what is a game with a breeze in the Pepsi Max department.
Blicks will be in the fireplace tonight when they take against IA in direct broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
The firewood then takes out the playing ban because of four reminders on the game and therefore does not come into play with a new haircut as in the games of the summer to this day.
He had written "blah, blah, blah" on his collar for the game at the HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the favor, but speaking of character then this was rather better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every single time and if there was someone going to even this game then I thought he would do it or make it, "said the Gudmund son of Benedict in the Pepsi Max groom, when it was thought that Brynjolf was fighting.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's hard sometimes to figure it out in what position he is.
He searches out a little left when it comes to the play, but he has a very free roll in the team, "said Hjarvar the son of Hafarnadar.
The Torkell Man of the son of Peter says Brynjolf, "A true joy," and rejoices in having a man of colour in the band, "There is no one sharing that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love it with my hair, and to always be ready to come and answer in interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people busy by him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
"I'm a fun man.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it. "
People are reading the interviews with Brynjölf, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, "said Monn.
KR player says he wants to leave the company -- "I've been in touch with some of the B-department."
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max squad, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish service Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Danmerkur.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the period in the country, but to that end, he first needs to terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic chance.
The company knows that I miss Danmarks and has shown me a great understanding, "Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with some of the B-division and will probably switch over before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR. "
Then he says he needs every chance to take on a pay reduction in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland."
The wheel whisker Bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - Responds now separately after the DV round
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had a lot of interest, unlike most of them.
He will wash up, and save the lost, and the stolen wheels, and the electricians, and the wrists.
Has Bjartmar learned the name "the bike whistle" before the week.
Yesterday, there was such a great fight when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar.
Visit the DV then in discussions on Facebook group of Western towns where it was found that Bjartmar had taken the man on the talk at the East Valley and said the vestibule might be stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original typos of the driver but that Bjartmar has stolen him.
These texts have now been modified to Facebook and the instructions of the original DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says initial news of the case does not describe what really went on yesterday in Eastern Valley.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from a victim of an electric vehicle that this was indeed his electric vehicle.
The information received from others was considered to be the owner, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and I knew at the shuttle, and finally with information that there were electric shutters who had been missing for a long time and were looking for it.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him getting ready to go on the shuttle, I decided to whine to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word. "
Bjartmar says that the man on the shuttle has immediately ordered him to show him the receipt for the bike and have himself called the police.
"Yeah, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved property on his electric transmission and went away.
Later the right owner of the electric shuttle said from his story on Facebook, as reported in previous news.
In this amount of year that Bjartmar has spent a while on his work he says he can count the changes that he ended up at the edge of the people on the fingers of another hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the hardest men of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar, pointing out that the ranger thieves are the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, the addicts, the psychopath people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
"The fool is a harsh master and somehow the road needs to invest the next dose, for unfortunately there is a thief on such freefulness easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
"My communication with these people is in fact so good that I have come with a lot of the good people with me in the team.
The example is that people have been taking care of themselves and looking for me and helping me with what I'm doing, "he says.
In general, there is a communication between Bjartmar and a group of racekeepers on polite nights.
Some know of him and what he is doing and ask peacefully to show him receipts, stellar numbers of wheels and so on.
A tricycle thief is a big problem that has been poorly covered.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are going to point out to people to talk to him out of a chair-and-bone wheel.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous news distribution of DV and does not claim to be any kind of self-imposed regulation in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he has now not come on half ice with his attention, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, says Bjartmar so certainly be.
"Of course the police are doing this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are quite simply not doing this.
I have to look up the police driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's clean-cut, so-called ruthless in this matter. "
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this class, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much in having up on chairs, that sometimes he comes on his "shoulders" on the street that they only have the right Bjartmer wheels that they had previously reached in.
The exchanges that Bjartmar has called for from the police have caused her not to come clean.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not me to blame, and it's not the owners of the Rangers to teach," said Bjartmar, and it feels sorry that the victim of the Ranger Ranger thief needs to suffer for the emptiness of the police in this class of actions.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
We can find stories of the people thanks Bjartmari for getting their possessions back to them.
By himself says Bjartmar has long been losing the number of race wheels that he has provided, but the amounts will certainly run in millions, if not millions.
This is where electrical fluids, electric wheels and electric shutters are heavy, but electric fluids can grow up below half a million.
Bjartmar works for another day in a playground, and every weekend he works in a community.
Therefore his reed is unrewarded, which he does in his time of rest.
Lively lands and long shadows
In 2019, there was a great year of birthday in the history of a life republic in Iceland.
The officials had been repaid from the King of Denmark all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 the living sons of the living sons of the living sons of the living sons of the living sons of all the public servants were established, which eventually became the living sons of all the living servants.
The basis for the current life of the general wage earners was then established with global core contracts at the labour market in 1969, which was announced on the basis of a work-related life resource with a compulsory and full collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were then laid down on the basis of these contracts and the life-cycle system continued to grow accordingly.
The life-risk system of the wage-earners was not the only rotational change that the 20-year-old labour force was able to perform with its chorus.
In 1955, job insecurity had had similar outcomes in the history of the labour market events, and the association had gradually developed its requirements on sickness law and health care, a major right of leave, a reduction in working hours, improvements in housing matters and other things that were of major importance.
All of these rights cost a great and strict battle, but were found to be much higher and more permanent than the increase in the acre in the wage coverage, which was equally severe in the high value of the post-war period and up to 1990 as many commemorations.
The beneficiary of the establishment of the General Life Society in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually came together to say that the seas would be in a proven ownership of the social partners, the labour market movement had to fall under the responsibility of their management to order the representatives of employers and social partners to the same extent.
In the next few years, the demand for the majority of employees in the management of the sector was often discussed by the social partners, but she was never able to walk, and so we are still sitting up with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the social partners are not in the majority of the management of the sector.
Paragraph 36 of the Law No 129 / 1997 on the liability of civil society and the function of civil society is based on the principle of investment policy.
There, in the first century, says that "the life of a Jew shall have an interest in society in the light of light."
In the fifth century also says, "The Jews of life shall set themselves a moral goal in the capital."
In the Lifeyris Group, the following decisions are included, following the previous legal decisions:
The Life Society is a member of the rules of the United Nations PRI on the responsibility for investments, together with many of the largest living and professional investors of the Western and European seas.
The rules set out how environmental and social concerns, as well as good governance, can help to improve the investment performance of the securities collection.
This brings together the interests of the economy and the objectives of the community in a wider context.
LV believes it is important for companies, especially those registered at the parcel market, to set up a public policy on: good governance of community responsibility and environmental issues.
The Lifeyris community of Gildi, which has the largest region of the country, has set itself a "policy of accountability for investments" and there are similar decisions.
This is all ripped up here as an entry into the newest language of the Islang, "Shadow Management."
As the case has changed, it is not expected that it has been defined as a matter of urgency, but the following definition now appears to me to be "most accurate": Shadow management is when the head of the board of directors says in the media that he is going to send the company's representatives to the board of biosecurity recommendations or instructions on how to take action in a specific case.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be expelled from control at first convenience.
If the foreman does not carry this in the media and does not talk about the story, then it is not "shadow control" end of the story that is such a communication between men, of course, in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll let the reader think about how he feels "shadowy."
There are mainly two men who have tried to meet this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
These are the Hour of the son of Aegi, the reporter of the newspaper, and Áshgeir the son of Jonah, the captain of the bank.
The title of both became until after Bogson Nils Bogson's President, Icelandair, had spoken of his intention to terminate the agreement of the company with the Flying and Flying Servants (resign them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson's son, the Chairman of the Shopkeepers of Reykjavik, sent them out the orders of the company's representatives in the Management of the Liveyristsförden to support the potential purchase of the shares of the company, or they might be made to be given.
A few days later, Bogi Nil returned his decision, and after that Ragnar Thor went in the same way with his commands, which were of course in the decision of Boga.
However, they saw Hartar and Asgeir for reasons to share the matter in the Friday Newsletter with great words about shadow management, crime and the need for changes in law.
A small number of them should certainly be weighed into a heavy load, even if the blessed one had been in a state of conjunctivization and had been wiped out soon.
As this is important, we should consider the substance itself at the end.
I was here before the things in the laws about the life of a Jew that were all about this.
In that case, the management of the environment must take care of the interests of the social partners and have a moral objective in the investments, and these elements are elaborated more closely in the agreed terms both of Gildis and of the Lifeyris community of merchants as I mentioned.
However, LIFE countries should NOT look at their investments only for a short period of time.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and it would not be necessary for a long time to judge such matters in the past, as large bank loans and loans have gone to the unforgettable adventures and environmental issues, with severe consequences.
The head of Icelandair was obviously on the neck of ice when he thought about wiping out the entire group of employees, thus dragging significantly from the well-being that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards the investments.
Better yet, he looked at himself and pulled it back.
It is time to see whether it is enough for the capital investment of the community to be responsible to the community when it is set up.
A writer is an ex-professor of physics and science history.
One of the infected didn't have a way of coming home.
One of the three that was detected with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Eystrasalt State of July 15 last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic who, however, is not established here at the current age and therefore did not receive any clear instructions to have such called homecoming after coming to the country and going to another sample a few days after coming.
He got negative from the shimmer at the border.
"But he is in an Icelandic community and is actually going to go into it," says Kamilla Josep's daughter, a specialist in the field of health protection at the Department of Agriculture and the local health service during the summer break, in conversation with the Newsletter today.
"He used the English form and there is no obligation to file the number and if the subject is not recorded then you are not automatically invited in the second view."
She says that the man could have used the English form because he is actually a resident of England rather than because of his connection in the country that an Icelandic would have preferred to use it Icelandic.
But he didn't understand.
"When the doctrine is not recorded, you must seek it yourself to come into the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realised that it was the right way, "says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic messaging system, although Islanders do not record their number.
Or to do so somehow more clearly who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system, "she explains.
As a better way of dealing with the affected, however, the arrival in the country is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, an Icelandic national.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was spotted yesterday and were all in common with him.
They are about to go to a sample, but two of them are about to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got negative from his sample at the border of July 15th.
Kamilla probably says he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be detected in it when the specimen was taken at the border.
However, she does not wish to rule out the fact that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but did not apply the virus to the country.
"It is not quite possible to claim that this is certainly imported contamination because it is a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here as these two who have caused a little control in connection with the athlete."
That's what she says, though, that it's very unlikely because of how few men were involved here.
"It is in fact very unlikely," says Kamilla, but takes the view that it cannot be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been completed by classifying the virus in the man.
"If we have a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has applied it to the country."
Piparsprey and blow directly against opponents
There was an agreement between the police and opponents in Seattle last night.
The law used the adversaries of the pipe spray and the undeadly grenades, but the adversaries of the broken windows and turned on.
45 opponents were arrested and 21 officers were killed.
Police violence and ethics were opposed to the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were supported in Portland in Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, there was one opposing shot to death.
According to the evidence on the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands came together in peaceful protests.
The people then lit up in the building area and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
After that, the lawyers said the objections were undisturbed, and to the battle came between the groups of opponents and the police.
If justice is demanded in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23-year-old black man murdered by the police in August last year, at least by opponents.
A car went through a group of opponents in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of soldiers of the National Guard came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, 26-year-old black woman murdered by the police in her home in March last.
The group carried firearms and joined the closed streets where it regulates the opposition from the group of people who opposed the protests and also carried firearms.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where the opponents remembered James Scurlock, 22-year-old black man murdered by a white barbarian in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskår, Head of Mate Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final course of the English selection department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, the end of Sunshine and his men in the fifth seat and lose there of the Master's seat.
However, they should still expect to get to the Championship by working the European Union in the next month.
"We're not at the end.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now, "said Solskär.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a great deal of land to get the two teams above us," said Solskär.
It is clear that the nerves of people will become dandelion at 3: 00 today, but Solskär tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, then you have to get used to being under pressure at the last game of the time.
It's nothing new, and this is where the company is based.
We have created a great opportunity to end the time well and now it is ours to take advantage of it, "said Solskär.
"This is not the most important game of the time, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football game, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our time, we have already had many times to define this time. "
"Come Bruno Fernandes changed greatly for us and I believe that we are in a better form and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period," said Solskär.
Sixty-five thousand on the sun ring.
65,490 new contamination of the coronary virus was detected in the United States last night according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea from the beginning of their age in that country.
900 deaths were caused by the virus last night, but the last four days were more than 1,000 deaths per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the prophecy of the United States Police Office, CNN has reported that the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000, 15th August next.
Fear the second wave of the past
The Government of Spain is now trying for sick people to withhold from the increased prevalence of COVID - 19 in the country.
The Spanish Health Service reported over 920 new COVID - 19 cases, both on Thursday and Friday.
There has been no further analysis in one day from the beginning of May and the issues at the same time as the Spanish start to remove one of the most stringent exits in Europe.
The backdrop led to the British authorities now having a passenger coming from Spain to go to an emergency at home.
A week ago, Spain was on the list of British safe states.
The situation is worse in Catalonia in the northeast part of Spain, where the government has taken more extensive measures to try to match the growth rate.
In the capital of the city of Barselón, the fun stations will be closed for the next two weeks and the old houses will be closed at midnight.
The exit ban is now valid for 200,000 inhabitants of the Segira County in the western part of Catalonia.
It is estimated that the decision by the British authorities will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is heavily concerned with the arrival of the foreign travelers and is badly affected after the end of the year.
And Tui, the greatest of the cities of the United Kingdom, called off all the flights that were planned this day to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The authorities around the world are told to prepare themselves for the second wave of the tide, but there seems to be a small interest in taking back to an important exit band that has put the economy to waste.
For example, Boris Johnson, President of the United States of America, has taken a very bad view of this, like nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the President of France, said that the people "would not get the life of, economic or social," if once again were taken to an exile in a country.
It is hoped that many councillors will be able to reach a local town, city or area in order to withhold the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new transmission in Iceland - Three inland
Three internal contamination were detected yesterday in addition to two additional border contamination.
Thus, five subjects with positive Covid-19 infection were detected yesterday in Iceland.
In the announcement by the public, one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football session.
Has he been sent in solitude and sixteen that were in close contact with him in a discomfort.
The infection was a part of the community activity in Reykjavik and according to the report, "only part of the athlete" is in a sick state.
Other people who were sent into an emergency were connected to the man in another way.
The source of this infection is undetected and full-time infection in the national legislator.
The opponents of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of the health care professional and the general public that are still in place and have taken appropriate action.
However, the images of the moth were brought to the attention of a very close fellowship to celebrate the good work of his people in the field.
Just before 11: 00 today, opponents will be publishing the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says "ATH: Parents please respect the rules of competition to pick up their own stuff in school.
Ancients aren't allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding. "
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported last morning.
According to the report: "An Icelandic genetic analysis has reported the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
Infectious infection is also involved and is infected in isolation and 12 in infection due to infection.
The third infection is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was spotted on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitude and six who were in close contact with him in a hospital.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at border level and are awaited for further studies such as a transmissible pathway at border level.
Finally, the report states that the National Public Service and the Agency of the National Health Service (GPA) are responsible for taking care of people and taking good care of individual infectious diseases.
The least doubt is whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is that the same person is asked to go to the next health care centre for a sample.
Patreksförður says the tent area booked up for the shopping weekend - Direct guests
The parking lot at Patrex is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of Western City.
Guests should look at other guest options.
The names of the west city of Balududal, the field of the tent, Melanes in the Red land, the hotel of Flocalund, and the hotel of Breðavik, as another choice in the station.
Enough is enough to be on the Patrex of this weekend; for as in the past year the city of Tyre, the feast of the Islandic homeland, will be kept in the city.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
For an application in the tent area to judge, good saturation this year can be expected, if the weather does not set a line in the account, but DV earlier today said from the distant prophecy.
May the worst weather be expected sunny, and hope for the Patrexes.
The web bb.is first told, and said that all other guests in the city were already booked.
Whole village house caves down to the best place in the city
Romans live free on Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are recovering from building permits, their performance has been reversed in the system over the course of three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive surroundings of Reykjavíkurkos, there is a large multi-dwelling house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house there's about 600 meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two steps which each store four rather good apartments.
They're in the range of 93-130 meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has included videoilseed, the Shoes, the dairy store, the milk sales, the Joe shootout, the fish sale and now Håskolapler.
The house has, as much as it may be, remembered its fierce beauty.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the accompanying images.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 ehf are listed in the company register of other Magnus Magnusson and the Godrún Helga Larrusdotti.
Magnus went to the owner group of the City and was the defender of the City family.
The owner of the property company is a Steelship ehf.
The steelship is the capital company of the Holy Father's daughter and her children.
Gudrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
And God and her husband, August the son of Gudmundur, went out of the ship of steel once.
D18 ehf bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little been held since.
Tell neighbors the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, but mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook site of residents in the neighborhood, one of the residents says that the house has "not been particularly lively last year."
It may be recorded that owners have sour about a few years after changing the house and the country.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something nice to this spot and it's sad that this has dragged like this."
If he says he's a weirdo to the owners of the house for not having done this, find some common flat with the neighbors of the house and stop this "lawyman."
"Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can move this and finish it."
The "legal bottlenecks" set up is the design process of the court that has been going on since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then granted permission to build a height above the current multi-dwelling house and behind the house, a new lift house and a building on one hill plus a basement.
The building permit granted for the implementation was available to the Environmental and Resource Management Board, and it was deduced from the value of the implementation which was not supported by the division system and was not adequate for the presentation of the results.
And the city of Reykjavikuru went forth with a work of division, and finished it with an advertisement in the days of July the first year.
It was also well planned and called it from March 2020.
At this point in time, therefore, almost three years have passed since the initial application for building permits and the owners of the house were at the beginning.
At this time, the house had been hit down by speech and neighbors were able to get tired.
When DV questioned the neighbors of the house into the condition and the neighbours' reactions, the responses were different.
Some had understanding of the intentions of the property of the house, others not at all.
Other people turn their anger into the city, others don't.
Others were just angry, but nothing really went into anyone.
Others also told me that the car was a firecracker, but the neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18-20 car system under their vehicle.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said he was tired of the administration:
"That we should go through the process of the third is absolutely incredible.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read. "
Today the house is empty, forsaken, and neglected.
A commemoration of the state of the city's governance and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of work that is now in the beginning.
When the reporter was carrying a garden on Dunhaga 18, he had a gallop door and a junkyard.
Playstation computer and recent television were within another piece of garbage on the ground - sacrifice of ice cream.
The opp was entered into the old office of Håskolaprenten, and there were numerous cats of the odour to judge.
It's clear that someone's been dressing up in one corner, but no one's visible.
A stack of sows and beds, and a few boards of the pages of the earth, which are bound to be a book, shall be blown.
The steps of the dwelling place were open as well as life in them both.
A reporter was so lucky to hit on their other residents.
There, Rumor said he'd get a potato dish for dinner and invite a reporter in.
The Romans work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and impersonate the DV that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and power.
Because of the condition of the house, it's not safe to collect a rent.
From the standings of mail in the house's front door, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers in the last loss.
The employment of employees has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of the transport process has led to the integration of the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most successful in making use of the services of the workforce.
However, the Dunhaga 18 residents seemed to have enough work to do and the jobs and staffs in the joint area to dry after a long day's work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys share seemed to be well maintained.
When the newsman cut the boys in bed, he suddenly got the coldness clear: At the best place in Reykjavik, there is 1,500 square feet of solid rock down.
Owners want to change the house to improve and neighbours want to improve the condition but share the definition of "improved."
Between the city's planning at the beginning of the year, the sacrifice of an end-to-end crop path, and the potential of a partner in the planning process, and the solution of the environmental and resource impact assessment committee.
In the house there are so Romanian workmen, perhaps just those who go to improve the situation, when the Islanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the weekpaper of DV July 17th.
In the treatment of overweight following coronary virus failure
The President of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in the fight against overweight, which will include the prohibition of abrupt advertising, following its severe illness, partly due to its weight.
It is clear that Johnson will present the campaign called Better Health tomorrow Monday, but with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe their bike rations for their clients in excess of their weight and will also take action to increase the number of cycles.
Then the advertisements will be abruptly bited in a television broadcast no later than 21: 00 in the evening, according to the authorised British media.
"COVID - 19 has awakened us to the short-term and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become health care, more effective and eat healthy food," which has been given by the spokesperson of the government.
Johnson himself has had problems with the weight of war, but he was put in a care facility when he was infected by the coron virus in the spring, and it is in part to his weight because he is believed to have been sick so seriously.
Women are better placed to lead the changes
If she said that the new government register was the biggest step the people could take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and the fight against corruption and the economy as a whole.
"We need to switch gears a little now and who's better to lead such changes than the group of the community that's easier to be in these values.
There are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their women's association.
To stand together and be together to lead changes.
So now it's only time for us to lead these changes. "
She said she was a little overlooking over the rush in Iceland as "best in the world" in both sex and human rights.
"Then we're not as ready to see what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a cave.
We need to know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the vocabulary of a set group.
We don't all have the same rules here, "Helga said.
She asked questions about women being in a lot of good things in Iceland, but she added, as in other places, the building of the Islanders to a great male value.
Did she say that the policy was concerned to create a sense of self-interest, leadership and authority that were the forces that maintained the wrong in all communities.
"Women have now established this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed that AlTENN is going to pull the trigger to look forward to this national vote from 2012," she said.
"It's this female value that we're thinking this out.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all actually sitting at the same table, "she said, adding that the former value was the basis of the new government register.
"We are a very rich country of natural humiliation and it is ridiculous that here are people who live with poor people.
It's ridiculous, we can change things, "said Helga.
"It is ridiculous that there is something natural law that women's work is always less paid.
It is ridiculous that pilots and nurses have to endlessly stand in a chorus just to get a decent salary. "
It is possible to sign the signature list for a new management register here through electronic Iceland.

Thoughts of infection and some of them show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronary virus
Five have been diagnosed with the internal coronary virus in the last three days and are most infected unconnected.
Thoughts have come into an infection due to this, and some of them are going to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were detected with the internal coronary virus last night and two at border screening.
A specialist in the National Medical Office says that the growing number of internal infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into the community.
"There has been a sequence of the previous internal infection and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so that we have no particular reason to think that she has gone dark in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now, "said Kamilla Sigrid Joseph's daughter, a specialist in the field of protection of the country's office.
Most of them have been associated with individuals from abroad.
More samples are being carried out almost than some of those co-infected have been showing the symptoms of the coronary virus.
"Now there is no influx in the course and less of other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat free by doing this test on individuals who at the time of the influx had found reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
Infectious infection is mostly complete but not excluded that more people will have to go to hospital.
Two of the infected persons were detected after receiving an athletic course.
It has been asked whether such events can be justified.
The Director of Public Communications is saying it slowly as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to be infected in sports.
"If there does not go further in isolation from these individuals after having been around them at these sports sessions then we can maintain that our anti-Semitic defenders have worked.
But it has not been revealed, "said Kamilla.
The work of the public service is in constant review.
"We need to be ready to grab into with further advice or limitations if it seems appropriate," said Kamilla.
After a week or so, there will be a number of data marks that will be emptied into a thousand people.
This new location may affect relaxations.

An attack between the police and opponents in Seattle.
The Seattle City Council in Washington has described a rebellion situation following popular protests in the centre of the city.
And yesterday the law laid hold for a blast and a pipe to tempt the great areas that the adversaries laid down, and stretched over many houses in the border of the congregation of the city.
The police reported on Twitter at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that a study was carried out on damage to the city police station yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The civil and police authorities say that opponents have cashed a police force with pots, bottles, mortars and other detonators, and were one policeman moved to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the Seattle Summit was peaceful for a long time ahead of it.
The bladder was made available to show opponents in Portland in Oregon, but in this city there has been a tougher fight between opponents and the heavy-duty police.
There, like in several cities of the United States, people gather together under the signs of Black Lives Matter, commemorating Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, opposing systematic racism in the American community and demanding redundancy.
Not revoked until after the vote
There is still no question of whether their resignation by Icelandair, which should take value for the next month's meeting, will be reversed.
The electronic vote on the charter agreement of the Icelandic airline on behalf of the Icelandair airline will be closed tomorrow at noon.
The Goddess of Liney John's daughter, the chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the appointments until the outcome of the vote is reached.
"This is cleverly connected," says Gudlaug Líney.
"There has been no revocation, this must go to lie for so that the people must be able to use the machines.
So, of course, people are uncomfortable to know if they will be working after the month. "
It's a contract signed a week ago, July 19.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and will be based on a contract previously concluded by the pilots in a vote.
The 17th July approved the board of directors and the trustee of the airline company Iceland to invite all-military work stops at Icelandair, their associates agreed to do so in a vote.
To her never came, but this was decided following the decision of the Iceland Air to end talks with the Flight Flight Company, resign all its pilots and search for contracts with another Flight Flight Company.
Then the company's pilots had to take on the security team on board temporarily.
Ask her how she thinks the vote will take place, says God Liney hard to say about it.
"People are in wounds after this visit to Icelandair, when all the flight crew of the company was dismissed and announced that the agreement would be with another steward company.
Now it becomes clear whether it has any effect, "she says.
940 pilots worked at Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their resignation is a rebellion, and he is three months with those who have good work, and he closes the month of Juli-ugu.
In this group, there are about 90% of Icelandair pilots.
What does the contract not accept?
"Then we wish for continuing discussions with our observers.
With this deal, we are meeting the requirements of the Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots have gone too far. "
Decision on the conclusion of the contract and Iselandair will present the second quarter of the year tomorrow
Flight clearance for a new contract ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair figures for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but the emergency results suggest that the company's consumption has decreased by 85% from the same period in the previous year.
The legal opinion on the charter agreement of the airline company of Iceland and the Association of Activity for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who can subscribe to the contract are Icelandair employees who pay the company fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new charter agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday earlier, Icelandair had broken talks with the company after the previous agreement was concluded by the flight crew at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had said all the pilots and the fleets of the company up on Friday but were drained back after a new choir agreement was signed.
According to new merchandise contracts, flights need to fly five hours more per month before the same starting point.
The agreement is valid until 2025, but the decisions of the pilots and the flight crew have been agreed for how long they can fly on one watch.
The agreement was introduced to FFI's associates at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flights that were discussed by the news agencies over the discontent of the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that it would be necessary to agree to the contract in order to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's statement for the second quarter of the year will be presented tomorrow in addition to the EBIT company, its revenue for the financial sector and the tax, according to the emergency additional results negative of 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion ISK.
Icelandair sent the purchase hall emergency calculations last Wednesday, but it said that the company had taken about 60 million dollars on the fourth day or about 8.3 million crowns.
Handheld money and its equivalent has been around 154 million US dollars at the end of the fourth century, around 21 billion corns.
Icelandair is pursuing as well as offering the company's share in August.
Icelandair is about to conclude a contract with 15 lenders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer at the end of the month before a partial offer is made.
New variant rather than new type of virus
"New virus only means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been painted inside, "says Már Kristjansson, Chief Medical Officer of the National Hospital for Infectious Disease, about the allegations that" new type of virus "has been detected here in the country.
Three internal contractions were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was found to have been part of a social sport team at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection remains undetected and infected.
Infection was also detected in a person who came to the country on 15 July and there were two co-infected subjects starting to show COVID - 19 symptoms.
In that case, infection was reported yesterday in relation to an infection reported earlier and following a sequence analysis by the Icelandic genome analysis "a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Infection is complete in connection with that infection.
Mar indicates that there is no new virus, but this is the same virus that has spread throughout the world, i.e. the new coronary virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more right to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it could say anything about other waves of destruction being started says Már that as is the case at hand and it could go so that there will be no more of it.
"However, if there comes up a case within that country that is not connected from abroad and has the same genotype and this particular variant then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [on the second wave] but it is untimely to so support," explains Mår.
Happy birthday to the hot pot
Is the secret that the happiness of the Islanders hidden in the hot pots?
The day-type BBC leads to the likeness of a fun video that ignores the light of the swimming pool and hot water culture of the country.
The Icelandic bath culture is special in the world and it is clear that no one in the world has an equal number of bathing sites in each of its inhabitants.
The natural warmth of the earth is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of destruction which is in this land.
The education of children was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no longer able to use hot water for health care.
Dizziness is described as a fixed part of the general well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of the level and the position.
If the mobile phones are closed, people will talk on personal nights about home and space or use the like power of the water: thoughts and charged electrical loads of souls and bodies.
To fetch a hundred days of election
A hundred days till the Americans go to the election, and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-launch, but he's on the way to pick it up.
Joe Biden, the prospective provider of the Democratic League, has a great deal of advance on Trump on a national scene, has been taken by the viewers.
According to a recent survey of the AP News Group, the number of Americans is considered to be the wrong way.
The reaction of Trump to the world-wide destruction of the new coronar virus is equally very hostile and, in addition, it considers that more Americans than before the President has been ill-off in economic terms.
Now, only two out of every ten Americans say that America is on the right path.
32% say that Trump's reaction is supportive of age, and 48% say he's kept well in economic terms.
In March it was 56% and in January it was 67%.
Based on the mean of FireThirtyEight, Biden 49.9% is followed by Trump 41.9%.
Trump himself has tried to move his attention from his progress towards the age of death to Biden, pushing under such called cultural divisions and announcing policies to turn to law and order.
However, Biden's bid is a big boost to keep the attention on Trump and reckons there is a great chance of winning if the race is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Intrigued Trump also appears to be coming down to the Senate of the Republican League and fears that the Democrats might even reach a majority in the United States of America, which has hitherto been very high.
Politico told me in the morning that it would keep the company and the provider comparable, and it is now the Repúblikanekultur would be its greatest derelict in the decade.
The international community has experienced particularly bad events in the elections in 2016, and now it looks like this development will continue.
Trump has in the past few days tried to frighten the residents to follow, including by saying that the Biden President, he will destroy the aliens and push under the genocide.
Among other things, Trump has dropped down a regulation from the time Barack Obama in the White House which was intended to increase the diversity of outdoors.
Then he encouraged the "housekeeper" to exterminate the United States to read the article of the former head of state of New York, where she believed it was that Biden would destroy the aliens and took Trump under it.
"Biden will destroy your surroundings and American dreams.
I will keep it, and even make it even better! "said the President.
The citizens of the United States of America are an ever-increasing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they're about half of the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Min Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Inspectors have shown that even though Trump secured a large majority of the foreign population in 2016, there has been a significant contraction in his follow-up.
Although there are differences between the females, Biden has recommended about 15 percent advance on Trump in the outsiders since then.

Will the Olympia fire be illuminated at the end of the aisle?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world fighters have been making up to this date, the President of the International Olympic Federation said that the Olympic Fire would be "the light at the end of the walk," and indicated there expected in the world-wide crowning virus that the world is now passing through in unification.
There are additional years to prepare and the government in Japan will add to the cost of the delay.
But everyone keeps their heads up a lot.
When it was reported that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the gospel of Japanese agents was undeceived.
They cried and laughed at, and Tokyo had asked to hold the games in 2016, but it was cut to a lower level for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan would take a bath in the world's attention.
The players were supposed to pass July 24th to August 9th, but have been postponed for years, starting on July 23rd, 2021, and ending on August 8th.
If the game cannot be held, if the crown virus is still too much of a threat, the game will be stopped.
No one really wants to think about them until the end.
Olympics are not an ordinary athlete competition.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be great and search for the last game.
The choice of the city for Olympia is based on the evaluation of the election committee of the city's presentations.
The greater the presentation - the more likely to sound the noose.
Tokyo accounted for 150 million dollars in trying to hold the Olympic Games in 2016 or 20 million crowns.
In the second time, when the 2020 show was applied for, there were 75 million dollars, around 10 billion crowns, in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had thus reached 30 million crowns for the project.
But the amount is just a drop in the ocean according to how much it costs to build the Olympia village, playground, and generally to strengthen the interior of the country to deal with such a challenge, prepare it and keep the play itself.
Orders in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been going on this day but have been postponed for one year because of the coron virus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, in the report by the government reviewer in Japan, which came out at the end of last year, it was found that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is unlikely that the cost of postponing plays will be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it will cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run from $15 to $30 million.
It is so high that all the taxes of the Icelandic state only fell short of half the Olympic Games, considering the lowest possible cost.
There are events of the size that they would have preferred to become the multifaceted theme of the economists, who try to deflect in numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
Most importantly, many people seem to have found that the impact of the Olympic Games is beyond such positive for the economy of those who hold them.
The short-term effect is some, for example, a large number of jobs for a very short period of time, but for a long time, the city would like to sit up with indebtedness and fear-high costs of a little used human inducer.
Río in Brazil is sitting up with serious debts due to the games in 2016 and has been in trouble to maintain all the major athletes built for the games.
According to the London 2012 performances, only 10% of the participants in the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
That means it wasn't about new jobs, except for a little bit.
In general, cities have not come out very well from the financial maintenance of Olympia because of the cost of the human activities built up for the games.
However, the benefits are considered to be due to the increased circulation of travellers who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which are still very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to take all the audiences that usually get the players.
The most important thing, however, is the honour which the cities seem to be chosen, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
For, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy brought by the players is not natural that it can be valued.
But although the show is very important and there is no saving, of course this is not just about money.
It's the athletic heroes that are at the forefront.
For some of the good people, it's just by surprise, love to postpone the games.
The Australian fifth-grade wife and the goldsman in their analysis of the recent Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, are, for example, classy and had been away for a long time in the summer, but they expect to be in competition form for the games in 2021.
She is therefore among the athletes who are only rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to quit after the games this year, they had been kept at the right time, meaning the respite of the games in some cases that they quit the competition before the players take place.
Simply do not trust your body to pass through years in addition to stranded exercises.
Few athletes showed up as strongly in the hearts of the audience of the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016 and Simone Biles, a star of the world.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending some interviews in his home country of America lately to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not sure she'll be at the top of the game in the next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be high age, it is higher for a fireman in the front row.
"This is a sensitive subject," says Biles but smiling out in another interview that was published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Foundation asked whether she is going to get as far at the games 2021 as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be on top after a whole year in addition to the exercises," says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with a great deal more training.
Still, she's practicing a race for the Olympics in 2021.
Biles acknowledges that it has been unpleasant to have had to suddenly stop practicing at the highest time of the world and close the gym.
There were no exceptions for Biles more than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olypus could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly is better than most people.
"We have a stiff plan now.
It was hard to start practicing again only after the gym opened.
We started slow, but we're back to full stage, and I'm going to increase the practice just as closely as the year goes.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games are going to be, or whether they're going to be kept, but we're still practicing, considering they're going to be, that's all.
I have put too much on me to leave the athlete now, "says Biles.
With her like more blind substances or perhaps more conscious that the position can come up that the players will not be kept at all in 2021 either.
To think of it is hopeless, though.
No one can know how the world stage of the coronated virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games by the time they are held in the year.
Maybe the Olympia fire will be the light at the end of the Covid aisle.
Postponement of a wedding due to age
The Mother Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other important things to think about accurate now," said the actor in the conversation with People.
"We will certainly marry at some point and have the dream wedding and have all the presentations that we love.
But we decided to move forward and focus on what is important now and that is helping to share information about the importance of having a mask and staying home.
I look more at the world than the bridesmaids these days.
There's a lot going on, and we have to focus our attention on what's happening in the world. "
