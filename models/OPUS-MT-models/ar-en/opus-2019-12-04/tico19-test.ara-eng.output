How long have these symptoms been going on?
All chest pain should be treated this way, especially at your age.
In addition to the fever.
And you also need to check your cholesterol pressure.
And are you having a fever now?
And do you feel that pain in the chest now?
And besides, do you have a hard time breathing?
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides this?
And how high the temperature you have.
I have cough, too.
I have a little cold and cough.
I'm having some serious chest pain today.
And is this the right time for your straw fever?
And there's a chest pain.
And I think I have a small amount of fever.
And I want you to describe where it feels like chest pain.
They also have some fever.
And by the time you got diabetes,
And, you know, I feel like my chest's gonna crash.
And you know, people cough at me all the time.
And you're feeling chest pain.
And you said it was a pressure on your chest.
Any family member has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, cholesterol rise, or hypertension.
Are there any other symptoms or problems that I've noticed in addition to the muscle pain?
Are there other people in the house with the same symptoms you have?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Do you feel any stress?
Are you still feeling chest pain?
Because this is the flu season.
But we should not also ignore the chest pain caused by heart disease.
But the most important problem now is this chest pain.
But I'm having a hard time breathing.
But I know a lot of people are looking at me.
But we need to deal with every chest pain as seriously as possible.
But you're breathing right now, aren't you?
I totally forgot about that chest pain.
Do you feel like someone's pushing your chest?
Do you still have a feeling about the lack of breath?
Is he complaining about similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic disease like hypertension or anything like that?
Do you have any other diseases, chronic medical problems like diabetes?
Do you feel any stress breathing with that chest pain?
Do you have a hypertension?
Do you feel any stress breathing with that?
Do you know the symptoms she felt?
You see the picture?
He drank a lot of fluids today.
Still, I did diabetes tests.
Still, she has symptoms that are exactly the same as mine.
How high is your fever?
What about your blood pressure?
If your fever continues to rise,
If you reach the fever, you have a hundred and two or more.
If you think your symptoms or problems need a better examination.
I had a fever yesterday.
I had a little fever, too.
I had a fever yesterday.
I have severe chest pain here.
I'm also having a little hard to breathe.
I'll send you a picture.
I have some chest pain today.
I only have a little headache and a fever today.
In my opinion, it's the flu.
In my opinion, it's a simple flu.
Does it look like a heavy person is sitting on your chest?
It all started with headaches and fever at the same time.
There's a pain in the middle of my chest.
It's a pressure like chest pain.
It's in my chest.
He's in the middle of my chest.
It's in the middle of the chest.
I felt a pain in my chest.
I'm so worried about this chest pain.
I want you to describe this chest pain to me.
Like high blood pressure or diabetes.
It's like it's right in the middle of the chest.
Now you can have tachipirina for the fever.
Now, Mary, how many days have you been through these symptoms?
Now you said you had chest pain.
I have chest pain every now and then.
Well, do you have any other symptoms besides this other than pain?
Or do you feel like someone's sitting on your chest?
It's pretty much like the fever and the headaches from the cough and the muscle pain.
Right in the middle of my chest.
He set me up to feel the pain on this picture.
Since you had a fever.
So you think some of these symptoms might be associated with pregnancy?
So are your kids having some similar symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
The fever increases at night.
The fever I've had in the last two days.
I started to increase the fever last night.
This is Dr. Porter in the emergency room at the casualty screening center.
Well, can you tell me more about your chest pain?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body here in my chest.
Well, I'm in a lot of pain in my chest.
Well, when I felt that pain in my chest,
What kind of chest pain do you have?
When did this chest pain start?
What's the pain in your chest?
Where do you feel that pain in the chest? You feel that chest.
You have a little bit of a feeling in your chest.
You know I have diabetes and other things.
You said you had this chest pain.
The rapidly increasing cumulative number of Corona virus (Covid-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of Corona virus (Kovid-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that although the stage is different on the basis of the State, the Kovid-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all States.
Based on Italy & apos; s experience, States, hospitals and focused care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of Kuvid-19 patients in need of health care, in particular focused care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia were reported for unknown causes in Wuhan City, Hube Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCACH) stated that the pathogen, the new Corona virus, is now referred to as the Corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-KO-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-Cove-2 infection has been called Corona virus (Covid-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of the people with Kovid-19 have a mild disease; any respiratory infection is with or without symptoms, and most of them are recovering.
In about 14%, the Kovid-19 infection has increased to a more acute disease requiring hospital accommodation, while the remaining 6% of cases suffer from serious illness requiring focused care.
The mortality rate of patients who were hospitalized for Kovid-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess and compare the trends in the cumulative number of Kovid-19 in each European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) State and the United Kingdom (U-K) with those from the province of Hobe, China.
We also compare the current number of Kovid-19 cases in the States of the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 cases in EU / EEA States and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, Kovid-19 has become increasingly geographically widespread and follows the dynamics of the Kovid-19 pandemic in the rest of the world at present the dynamics of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared David-19 a prize.
In the Eurosophens issue of 5 March 2020, Spitri and others reported the first confirmed European case of Kovid-19 according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the European Union / European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for persons returning from Wahan, Hube Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, the cases of Kovid-19 were detected in all 30 countries of the European Union / European Economic Area (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), as between 31 December 2019 to this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Access to the cumulative number and rate of Kovid-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of cases reported in every country around the world, obtained from official sources only, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8: 00 a.m.
These data were used to assess and compare the trends of Kovid-19 in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of the active cases of Kovid-19, we calculated the cumulative number of cases of Kovid-19 interrupted within 14 days, and thus took into account the natural course of Kovid-19, in all States of the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also submitted the cumulative number of cases reported from each country from March 15, 2020 at 8: 00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Kovid-19 trends in EU / EEA States and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of Cauvid-19 cases taken over a 14-day period in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom have followed those of the province of Hobe (China) (figure 1).
For the European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EC) and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of Kovid-19 began to increase on almost 21 February and increased sharply on almost 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU / EEA and the United Kingdom showed trends similar to the cumulative number of Kovid-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of Kovid-19 cases in the States of the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of 15 March at 8: 00 a.m., 15 other EU / EEA and United Kingdom States reported the total number of cases already similar to those in Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of Kovid-19 is increasing rapidly in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative number of Kovid-19 indicate that the pandemic is increasing at a similar pace in all States.
Although States are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, the possibility of different definition of the situation in States and the different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested to confirm that they are infected with Covid-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation, where approximately 10% of Kovid-19 patients needed focused care and media sources reported that hospitals and focused care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the entry of hospitals and / or focused care units for the Kovid-19 cases are available at the EU / EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, they need to be systematically collected to update current control data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant diversity in the availability of intensive care and middle care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that States may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 for focused and medium care per 100,000 persons in 2010-11).
Models associated with the fulfilment of health care capacity, with estimates by each European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of the Kovid-19 cases that have entered the hospital associated with the & lt; 90% risk to exceed the capacity of the intensive care family, are available in the sixth update of the Cauvid-19 rapid risk assessment at the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
Given that the cases collected so far in certain areas of EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, and the fact that hospitals and focused care units usually serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide information on the cases and the focused care family at the level of the designation of regional units for statistics 2 (NTS-2).
Italy & apos; s experience and current trends in other States show that the Kovid-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
States, hospitals and focused care units should therefore prepare themselves for the sustainable community transition scenario of Lars-Cove-2 and increase the number of Kuvid-19 patients in need of health care, in particular focused care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a comprehensive, proactive approach is essential to delay the deployment of SARS-KO-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity during which countries can increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-KO-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, health-care systems in other EU / EEA States are likely to face an increase in the number of patients in need of focused care over the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the Corona 2019 (Kovid-19) virus, caused by the SARS-2 virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has resulted in the death of more than 3,000 people and the injury of over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like the same virus, SARS-KO-2, which led to thousands of people having a SARS disease in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, Kovid-19 has a risk and mortality rate of less than one sixth, but it is more mobile and effective among older people than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving subject matter of research.
We will address the fundamentals of the disease's epidemic, its causes, its viruses, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prediction and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the threatening disease.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgotten memory of all Chinese who were urged to stay in their homes throughout the weekend and for many weeks thereafter as a result of an emerging viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the Corona (Cove) virus, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to spread in 2003; then, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it Bars-Cove-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was called Cove-19 (Kovid-19).
The epidemic began in Wahan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has led to 80,000 confirmed cases of Kovid-19, with more than 40,000 patients out of hospitals and over 3,000 deaths.
WHO warned that Kovid-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months, more than 200 research on Kovid-19 has been published, including the virus science of the disease, its epidemic, its causes, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the isolated virus through many patients.
The objective of this review is to summarize the research progress on the new and rapidly evolving topic.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare Kovid-19 with Bars and another disease caused by Cove, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Merris, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far with regard to the prevention and prediction of the disease as well as some pressing questions that are still on the table.
Corona viruses were usually considered as causes of non-lethal diseases in human beings, and mainly caused about 15% of the common 4 cold earthquakes.
In this century, however, we have faced the virus of a high-disease Corona in human beings twice, Saris-Koff and Meris-Koff, which caused an initial outbreak of the disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a alarming rate of prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, the current Kovid-19 is a third outbreak of the Corona virus in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, for the first time, groups with unknown pneumonia were reported to the China National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the Corona virus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wohan reported the death of the first case.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, cases of infection among health-care providers were reported, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from one person to another.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed and all public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease stated that of the 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 were in direct contact with a market and an illusion of seafood, which was considered to be an unknown animal source at the start-up site.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of the issuance of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scale and gravity of the outbreak still need to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study conducted on 866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed patients with Kovid-19, provided a more updated explanation of the epidemic as follows (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / Ulbi-HX _ rHPX1qHA2bhda).
Saris-Kov-2 affected persons from all age groups, but mainly between the ages of 30 and 65.
About half of the 50-year-olds (47.7%) were over, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
Saris-Koff-2 has injured more men (0.31 / 100,000) than women (0.27 / 100,000).
Covid-19 has expanded between groups in and around Hoppe mainly.
Kovid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of the injury to the diagnosis.
The average period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of injury from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (basic reproduction number) was 3.77 (scope of confidence is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted basic reproduction figure was 2.23-4.82.
The number of casualties increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, in line with the many travel operations before the spring festival in China.
The rate of deaths among confirmed patients was 1.44% (the scope of confidence is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted rate of deaths for all patients was 3.06% (the scope of confidence is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for Kovid-19 were gender (male), age (60) and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a species of large and coated viruses containing a positive-oriented single-chain DNA genome.
It can be divided into four races: Alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and it is known that alpha and beta-Colombian viruses infect human beings.
The coated fork (S) of the sugar protein is linked to its cellular future, namely, the enzyme converted to the Angelisin 2 (ACE2) and the Betedel 4 (DP4) to the Lars-Cove and Meris-Cove, respectively, and then the membrane is integrated.
The DNA genome releases the virus to the Citoplasm; after the viral genome is reproduced, the rebuzi genome DNA is accompanied by the diabetes-cover proteins and the nucleus-based crate proteins are containers containing viruses, and is integrated with the plasma membrane for the subsequent release of the virus.
The first Gemini series of Lars-Cove-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-KO-2 is a new type of beta-Kow with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% of 10 samples that were sequenced from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan market for bohan seafood.
It's more like a Sars-Cove-2 genie than a Mars-Cove.
The electronic microscopy of the transition revealed that SARS-KO-2 is in very thin sections of human air traffic.
It was found that the human enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2 is the future of Lars-Cove-2 as well as Sars-Cove.
However, the S-KU-2 protein is more vulnerable to the human enzyme converted to Anitensene 2 than SARS-KU, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-KO-2 causes less severe infection in patients from SARS-KU.
SARS-KO-2 can also create a short, new, encrypted protein by orf3b and an encrypted protein by orf8.
Orf3b in Sars-Cove-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit the term IFNTE; however, orf8 does not contain any scope or pattern with a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Chu et al. reported the structure of the full length of the human enzyme converted to Angelisin 2 under the super-cold electronic microscope with the accuracy of 2.9 in a compound with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the boat, which had open and closed structures, had been assembled to form a destruction and that ACE2-B0AT1 could link the S protein, providing a guide to the identification of the Corona virus and the infection.
A sodium-based neutral amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to curb the infection of SARS-KF-2.
Original host and intermediate host
It has been known that Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove grew up from bats and were transferred to humans through butter and beauty cats, respectively.
By comparing the negative development of Lars-Cove-2 with other Corona viruses, the original host bats of Lars-Cove-2 were considered to be 96%, where the new virus corresponds to the 96% of the virus Corona that resembles a Sis of the bats and is called Bat-SL-COVZX45 and Bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediary host who helped HIV pass the factional barrier to the human being remains unknown, and has not yet clarified the course of transition.
Gi and others suggested snakes as a virus holder from bats to humans, which involved a similar re-installation within a protein S.
According to a study, in Guangzhou, China, researchers suggested that mural ant eaters - mammals with a long-term ant-eating tongue that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential medium host of SARS-KO-2 based on a 99% genetic symmetry in the Corona virus detected in the arterial ants & apos; eating and in SARS-KO-2.
However, the 1% difference spread over the course of two genomes is still a significant difference; therefore, we are waiting for conclusive results with concrete evidence (figure 33).
The chemical physical characteristics of SARS-KO-2 are still largely unknown.
Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove can survive in the lab for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days in a temperature below 20 ° C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-KO-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-KO-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol with a 75% concentration, chlorine-containing pathogens, peroxic acid, chlorofurm and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexedin, could effectively discourage the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks access to SARS-KO-2 and is therefore more vulnerable to the infection of the new virus.
At present, no detailed study on the immune response of SARS-KO-2 has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other Corona viruses, in particular Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove (figure 4).
In general, after an invasion of the host & apos; s virus, the natural immune system is identified through the future identification of patterns (BRS) including type C-type receptors similar to the tin, the similar future to the TIR, the similar to the range of sections associated with NLR and the similar future of RIG-I (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus stimulates the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturity of dialysis cells, and the installation of type I (IFN) electrons that reduce the spread of the virus and accelerate large biomatic cells for viral antigens.
However, N protein in SARS-KU can help HIV escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response will soon join the fight against HIV.
Tibetan lymph cells, including CD4 + and CD8 +, play an important role in defence.
CD4 + biota stimulates the production of HIV-specific antibodies, and CD8 + cells directly infected with the virus are killed.
Ti-cells produce active cytocones for infection to help the defense cells.
However, the Corona virus can reduce the functions of the tate cells by inducing the programmed death of the tate cells.
Menture immune, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary in the fight against viral infection.
For example, it neutralized the isolated antibodies from a recovering Merris-Cove patient.
On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free roots that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other members, and, at worst, a failure to perform multiple organ functions and death.
The SARS-KO-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is likely to affect older persons with multiple diseases and more pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been damaged to be more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average period for the custody of SARS-KO-2 is 1-14 days, or mostly 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the period of custody was on average 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As indicated above, a more recent study showed that the period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of custody, thus preventing people with infection but not suffering from HIV transmission.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with HIV are usually required to be subjected to quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often the main and first show of Kovid-19, and can not be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, respiratory stress, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, throat, nose, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from a lack of breath and / or a lack of blood spice one week after the disease began.
In extreme cases, the situation of patients has evolved rapidly to suffer acute respiratory syndrome, developmental trauma, metabolic acid and anaesthesia.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory and fever must be examined, even without being photographed to reveal pneumonia, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for respiratory distress and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group to which the infection was transmitted from a person with no symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that Mars-Cove patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory distress (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than Kovid-19 patients and were consistent with the death rate of Mars higher than Kovid-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and syringe (21%) were also observed in Merris patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that both fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), respiratory distress (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and throat (13 - 25%) were the most important symptoms, and that psychological support was needed for about 14 - 20% of the patients.
By 14 February, the death rate due to Kovid-19 was 2%, while the confirmed cases were 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, by November 2002, the rate of death due to SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mars, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study stated that the basic number of reproduction of SARS-KO was up to 6.47 with the scope of CA-95% confidence from 5.71 to 7.23, while the basic number of reproduction of SARS-KU ranged from only 2 to 4.
A comparison between SARS-KO-2, Merz-KU and SARS-KU in terms of their own symptoms, the mortality rate and the basic reproduction number is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-Kow-2 has a greater capacity to deploy than Mars-Cove and SARS-Kow, but it is less lethal than the last two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the Sars-Cove-2 epidemic than to control the Mars-Cove and Sars-Cove epidemics.
The beginning of the disease occurs mostly in the same family or from the same group or compound, like a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel to or residence in other affected areas or of mixing people or patients in the last two weeks before the disease.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients who had come out of hospitals could carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a natural or low number of ambient white blood cells (especially lymph cells) at the early stage.
For example, the lack of amphibians was detected with the number of white blood cells & lt; 4 x 109 / L, including the number of lymphatic cells & lt; 1 x 109 / L, and high levels of the asbestos and blood-containing transporter in 1,099 patients with Kovid-19.
The levels of liver enzyme, muscle and moglubine have increased in some patients & apos; blood, the increase in reactive protein C and the rate of the weight of the red cream in most patients & apos; blood.
In high-condition patients, the level of D has increased, as a result of the fracturing of vibrin in blood, and the number of lymph cells has gradually decreased.
In most of the Kovid-19 patients, radiation-imaging disorders are shown and are characterized by double or deep pulmonary shades of glass in the lungs.
Patients sometimes suffer from non-standard pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress (IRDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control infections, fluid accumulation, and high-level fibrosis severely affect the exchange of gases.
The functional dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 lung cells reduces the level of surface activity and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to extend and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, most often the worst results of chest radiation and the maximum extent of the disease are compared.
On February 18, 2020, Kovid-19 & apos; s first pathological analysis showed the dispersion of the lung cells, the formation of the halinic membrane, the spinal lymphatic lime and the several annual cell cells in the lungs of a patient who died of disease, in line with the physiology of the viral infection and the acute respiratory distress, and similar to what happens to patients with a cancer and a disease.
The detection of the RNA of Lars-Cove-2 has been used through the reaction of the PTBC to reverse versions as a key criterion for the diagnosis of Kovid-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative negative negative consequences, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RTBC) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
There's also a similar situation in Saris's diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiation detection is essential and essential for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol for the use of the Scherloc-based technology for the detection of SARS-KO-2, which is detecting parts of the RPA-KV-2 created at a rate of 20 times 10-18 Ml / L to 200 times 10-18 Ml (10-100 copies per micrometer of inputs) using a submersible in less than an hour without the need for accurate devices.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and relevance if it is verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new Corona virus, doctors can provide support care mainly to Kovid-19 patients, while testing a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed to treat other Corona viruses, such as SARS-Koff and Merz-Koff, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These include current and potential antiretroviral therapy, immunosuppressants, stimulants, plasma of recovering patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing for the development of antibodies and anti-virus vaccines.
SARS-KO-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other members that issue the transgenic enzyme of Angelisin 2, such as the digestive system, the intestines and the kidneys.
However, the dysfunction and failure of the respiratory system is the most serious threat to the patient and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is necessary to reduce symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, non-minor respiratory devices and low-resolution respiratory devices based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by outbody membrane tissue (ECM-O), which is a pulmonary cardiac bypass technique used to treat cardiovascular deficiency or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of a fluid balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and anatomy, and the protection of vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-KO-2 patients.
It is known that the cytocin storm is the result of an excessive reaction from the immune system of SARS and Merris patients.
The cytocin storm is a form of systematic inflammatory reaction that is characterized by the launch of a series of cytocons, including TNFTE, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNTE, IFNTE, IFNFF and MCP-1.
These cytocons induce immune cells to launch a large number of free roots, which is the main cause of acute respiratory syndrome and the failure of multiple organs.
The suppression of the infection is necessary in the treatment of the cetocin storms, especially for acute patients.
Active hormones, Tuselizomb and a single anti-anti-electron 6 body were used to treat the cytocin storm.
Other infections of the cytocin storm include the modification of the immune reaction to the following cells; the blockade of IFN-apos; IL-1; TNF; the discouraging of Janus Kenaz; Plinatomab; CABT of the Siotoxin 4 signals; and the Heston Desiteles.
Stimulants and immunogens have been widely used in a severe treatment to reduce the incidence of inflammatory damage.
However, greater doses of stimulants were not useful with severe lung injury in SARS and Kovid-19 patients.
Instead, it has caused severe side effects, especially vascular bone vaporation, which has a severe impact on the prediction of the disease.
However, it was recommended that short doses of small to medium-dose active hormones should be used with caution for critical Kovid-19 patients.
At the time of writing, the effectiveness of any antiretroviral treatment was not confirmed.
However, it was discovered that the giving of Reddsevere, the equivalent of New Caledonia, was effective with a US-19 patient.
Reimissevere is a new anti-virus developed by Gilliad in the first place to treat the diseases caused by the virus Ebola and Marburg.
Later, Remedesivere also showed potential inhibition of other DNA viruses in the single series, including the virus Merris and Saris.
Based on these viruses, Gilliad submitted a compound to China to conduct some experiments on individuals affected by SARS-Koff-2, and the results are closely monitored.
In addition, Parisitenab, Interveron-Alpha, Lupinavir / Ritonavir and Ripaviren were proposed as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other reverse reactions can occur after the combined treatment of Bluepinavir / Ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used with patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Plasma is a recovering patient and the generation of antibodies.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease is designed to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease in a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
AJ is produced by lymphatic cells to combat pathogens and other alien objects, and it recognizes and directly limits the unique molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from Kovid-19 and injected into 10 patients in serious situations.
Their symptoms have improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced infection and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to present this method for widespread use before specific treatments are reached.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the deficiencies associated with plasma have to be taken into account carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune reaction and cause cytocate release syndrome, which is likely to be a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large for the treatment of patients in critical situations.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, the isolation of biological cells from recovering patients and the identification of genetic codes that encrypt effective antibodies, or the examination of effective antibodies against the basic proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a range of multiple components in a different structure depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on traditional Chinese medical theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or vague as they are difficult to extract and verify or optimize.
Currently, because of the lack of effective and specific treatment for Kovid-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with light to medium symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of the Chow Feng Ji Do capsules and of the Leanne Hwa King Wen for the treatment of Kovid-19 has been discovered.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of Kovid-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of its patients, including Ganzo (63.7%), Ningetia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hobe, which used traditional Chinese medicine only with about 30% of its Kovid-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very approximate comparison, as many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his work partners published a study to compare the treatment of Western medicine (WM) individually with the joint treatment of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found out that the periods necessary to recover from the high body temperature, the removal of symptoms and the hospitalization were much shorter in the Western Medical + Traditional Chinese Medical Group than only in the Western Medical Treatment Group.
Most impressive, the rate of increase in symptoms (ranging from light to acute) was much lower in the Western Medical + Traditional Chinese Medicine Group compared to the Western Medicine Treatment Group only (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Group compared to the Western Medicine Treatment Group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-studied experiences on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to describe the procedure mechanism and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medical treatments or, if possible, their formulations.
Patients suspected of having been infected with Kovid-19 or confirmed are often very afraid of severe infection and even death, and people under quarantine are bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, lack of oxidation and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as active hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychological diseases were reported, including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychosis, mental symptoms, hallucinations and even suicide tendencies.
As part of the public health responses to the Kovid-19 outbreak, mandatory anarchy and quarantine can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to the Kovid-19 patients, persons suspected of being infected, persons in contact with them, as well as the general people in need.
Psychological support must include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear points of contact with regular and accurate updates on the spread of SARS-KO-2 and plans for its treatment, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct intermingling.
Effective vaccines to cut the transmission chain from animal depots and infected people to vulnerable hosts are necessary and often complementary to antiretroviral treatment in the fight against the epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines (S) to generate neutral, effective and long-range antibodies and / or preventive immune against SARS-Koff.
Life-to-life vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body of older persons, deadly challenge models and their prevention of the infection of animal virus has not been determined before a clinical study began.
This may be due to the fact that Saris disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the contrary, sporadic cases and groups of Merris continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other areas because of the continued presence of animal sources in the endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against Merris have been developed using an inactive virus, oxygen-deficiency rebuzi, viral tankers, nanomaterials, viruses-like particles, and damaged protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-KO-2 for non-immune personnel is an urgent and critical task to control the current ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (an average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the Korona virus.
Kovid-19, as a new disease, just started showing his entire clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.
However, like Saris and Meris, Kovid-19 is also associated with high prevalence and mortality rates in the case of severe patients.
The construction of a model of disease projections is therefore necessary for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in resource-limited areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the disease & apos; s pathological expectations of Covid-19 patients (table 33):
Age: The working age was the most important factor in determining the prospects for the functioning of SARS, which also applies to Kovid-19.
The 30-65 age groups were mainly infected with Kovid-19, with 47.7% of these patients over 50 years of age in a study conducted in 866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of focused care were more vulnerable to potential associated diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not (at the average age of 66 to 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for the results of Kovid-19 patients.
Sex: Saris-Koff-2 has injured more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 compared to 0.27 / 100,000), as explained above.
Associated diseases and complications: Covid-19 patients in need of focused care are more vulnerable to acute heart injuries and irregular heart attacks.
Heart attacks were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It was stated that SARS-KO-2 could also be associated with positive diphtheria cells with the enzyme converted to Angelisin 2, which could lead to liver dysfunction in Kovid-19 patients.
It should be noted that the underlying age and disease are strongly associated and may overlap.
Unnatural laboratory results: The level of blood-active protein C (CRP) reflects the severity of infection or tissue injury, and it was suggested that it be a predictive factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the level of C-positive protein be linked to the severity of Kovid-19 disease and its prospects.
In addition, the rise in the bending enzyme of LDH, the movement of the Asbestos Secretary (ABT), the enzyme of the Allan Secretary (ALT) and the CKR Kenaz (CK) may also help to predict the result.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of functional dysfunction in the heart or liver.
The main clinical symptoms: breast-ray imaging and progress of clinical symptoms must be taken into account together with other problems in predicting the results and multipliers of Kovid-19.
Use of stimulants: As explained above, stimulants are commonly used as an aid treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of a high dose of widely active hormones in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from subosteoporosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, stimulants must be used at a low dose and for a short period of time in Kovid-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the Kovid-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced exceptional stress; they often have long periods of quarantine, severe uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and their sick colleagues.
It is necessary to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, Kovid-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than Saris.
In addition to the reproduction of the lower respiratory system, SARS-KO-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory system and cause light or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other Corona viruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, early-stage or nursery patients can produce a large amount of HIV during day-to-day activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-Cove was considered to occur when the patients were in high condition, while most of the transmission of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of Kovid-19 is much stronger and more difficult in terms of control than that of Saris.
Ongoing strenuous efforts are being made in China, including the closure of Wahn, surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost all the population in the hope of impeding the transition of SARS-Koff-2.
Although these measures have greatly affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline will continue for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have the same level of optimism.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that Kovid-19, which appears to be much more infected than Saris, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longhini et al. set up a model for predicting the impact of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-Kow-2 could affect two thirds of the world & apos; s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-KO-2 was detected in the mid-track and throat surveys of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical flu-like attack.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, which indicates that current strategies may have been useful.
Epola was originally expected to cause up to 1 million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like Saris-Cove, Saris-Cove-2 can become weaker in terms of infection and eventually eliminate or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and Merris are shown below (figure 55).
SARS-KO-2 is moving at a higher rate through cough or sneeze, and can also be moved through direct contact with HIV-contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the poop, which raises a new possibility of moving from the poop to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infection, including 17 patients with other former diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Therefore, significant precautions are needed to protect human beings, particularly health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers who have reached out to patients or injured persons.
The wearing of face masks is the first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surface masks prevent liquids from a potential person from moving through the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where they can be passed to others.
However, N95 masks (series 1860s) can only be protected from the inhalation of small viruses by between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate fully; they are similar to SARS-K2 in size and are approximately 85 nm each.
Given that particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks that are connected together, health-care providers directly mixed with patients must wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health-care providers must wear appropriate isolation clubs to reduce greater communication with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone across the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor in Bars-Koff-2 was injured, although he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health-care providers should also wear transparent face-to-face condoms or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more than usual purgatory soap, try to stay home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potential individuals.
Three feet is a good distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-KO-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity with SARS-KU as reported on 7 January 2020 would have caused a high alert situation in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 outbreak of SARS.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Wahn al-citizens had not been assured that the new virus had a low rate of infection and a limited human-to-human reproduction and that there was no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This letter severely reduced public preparedness, particularly when the entire country was preparing for the spring festival, and critical time was being put in place to contain the disease in its lowest range in Wahan.
China & apos; s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behaviour and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential early epidemic rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to periodically test and improve the community response system.
The Kauvid-19 outbreak of the new SARS-KO-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing these lines.
Given that the virus is very similar to Saras-Koff and that the symptoms are also similar between Kovid-19 and Saris, the Kovid-19 outbreak has raised a sense of repeated SARS infection.
However, there are some outstanding differences between Kovid-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and to treat the patients.
Covid-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older persons than in young people.
Saris has a higher mortality rate than Kovid-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients even transmit the virus while they do not suffer from symptoms, while SARS usually do so when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of Covid-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why Saris-Cove-2 is spreading much faster and broader than Saris-Cove.
The regular RNA examination of SARS-KO-2 can be negative in some of the Kovid-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can be infected with HIV again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on Kovid-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did Saris-Cove-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% genetic symmetry between SARS-KO-2 and Virussi Corona equivalent to SARS in the bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-KO-2 comes from the bats.
What kind of animal was the intermediary that moved the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to number 1 and 2, we can't stop moving efficiently, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biometric chemical tests have shown that SARS-KO-2 is associated with the angenotoxin-2 enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the air-stream cells and cause subsequent pathogenic changes?
Is the virus also associated with the cells of the enzyme transgenic enzyme 2 in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long is this epidemic going to last?
How does the virus develop genetically as it moves among humans?
Is it going to be a world-wide pandemic, or is it fading like a serial killer, or is it coming back periodically like a flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to seek answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to bring our lives back to normal.
Animal assets of human Corona viruses
The boom and adaptation lead to the common development of the Corona virus and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two types of human Corona virus (human Corona virus) caused a light disease, such as the cold.
The spread of SARS and the Middle East & apos; s respiratory syndrome (Merris) has shown the other face to the extent to which human Corona virus infection can be dangerous and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS Kow-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 rehighlighted the Koruna virus, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother, SARS-Koff.
The human Corona virus is an animal disease of origin, so our understanding of the animal assets of the human Corona virus would serve us well.
Most of our human Corona viruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
The intermediate warehouse hosts of some human Corona virus have also been identified.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interactive relationships between the Corona virus and the animal host also provides an important view of the emergence of the Corona virus in human beings.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available on the seven human Korona viruses, with a focus on the history of their detection, as well as their animal assets and species transmission.
More importantly, we compare and distinguish between different human Corona viruses from the perspective of the development of the virus and the re-establishment of the genome.
The disease caused by the current Corona virus is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for a successful replacement of the host and the impact of the complications of the development of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Corona (Corona) viruses belong to the coronary virus family, which includes a set of coated viruses with rebuzzi DNA in a positive-oriented chain.
These viruses contain the largest genome of ribozi-DNA viruses, which are 26 to 32 kilos of base and are called "coronary viruses" by this name because their composition is similar to the crown under the electronic microscope.
In terms of synthetic characteristics, the Corona virus contains undivided genomes that are involved in a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading lines (ORF1a and ORF1b), which turn into the two types of copied polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab).
Multiple proteins are further treated for the generation of 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1 ~ 16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading of structural proteins, including Spike (S), the cover (E), the membrane (M) and the nuclear protein (N).
Various strains of Corona viruses also encrypt a number of additional proteins from private strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequence, Corona viruses are classified into four species (alpha-Corona virus, beta-Corona virus, gamma virus, and the beta-Corona virus virus), including those that include most of the human Corona virus and are divided into four strains (a, b, c and d).
The genetic development evidence has shown that bats and rodents work as genetic origin for most of the alpha-Corona virus and the beta-Corona virus, while birds are the main repository of the gamma-korona virus and the delta-Corona virus.
Over thousands of years, Corona viruses have consistently crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as causes of serious human diseases.
So far, seven human koruna viruses are known.
These include the human Corona-229E virus and the human Corona-NL63 virus belonging to the Alpha Corona virus.
The other five Beta-Corona viruses include the human Corona-OC43 virus, the human Corona-HKU1 virus, the Corona virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-KU), the Corona virus associated with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Merras-Cove) and the Saris-Cove-2.
Human Corona-229E, Human Corona-OC43, Human Corona-HKU1 and Human Corona-NL63 are usually causing light symptoms, such as the cold, diarrhea or both.
In contrast, SARS-KU and Merz-Koff and the newly identified virus SARS-KO-2 are all highly pathogenic, causing severe infection to the lower respiratory system of more patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and non-lung symptoms.
It was isolated from the human Corona-229E virus, the first strain of B814, from the nasal release of patients with the flu in the mid-1960s.
A lot of information has been collected since then through intensive studies on the human Corona-229E virus and the human Corona-OC43 virus, whose symptoms are automatically recovered.
In fact, it was generally recognized that human Corona virus infection was harmless until Saris was exposed.
A major outbreak in 2003 is one of the most deadly epidemics in our current history, with over 8,000 people with almost 10% deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Merris) has spread a constant epidemic on the Arab peninsula with a sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human Corona virus 2019 (the new human Corona virus - 2019), renamed Saris Cove-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of the Corona 2019 virus (Kovid-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and injured more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world is ready to face the next Saris Cove-2.
All seven human Corona viruses have animal assets of bats, rats, or pets.
It supports multiple evidence that the evolutionary assets of all human Corona viruses are from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show a significant genetic diversity.
The Kovid-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The tracking of the animal assets of the human Corona virus has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors of movement between species.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the warehouse, the intermediate host and the inflated host animal (the huge host animals) of Lars Cove-2, with important effects to prevent future impacts.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal assets, species transmission and human Corona viruses cause disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of human Corona viruses are usually unpathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after they have moved between species to a new host.
We are also reviewing the human Corona virus course assessment, where the increase in its transmission is often accompanied by a reduction in the incidence of disease.
We are also discussing in this context the results of the current outbreak of Saris Kove-2.
The animal virus of Corona has been known since the late 1930s.
Before isolating the B814 strain of human Corona-229E for the first time from the nascent release of patients with a cold, various types of Corona virus were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkey, mice, cows, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven types of human Corona virus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human Corona virus in chronological order (table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of the human Corona-229E virus was removed from the respiratory system for patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in the ranks of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients living with the human Corona-229E virus are suffering from common symptoms of the cold, including headaches, sneakers, insomnia, with fever, and cough in about 10-20% of the cases.
Later in 1967, the human Corona-OC43 virus was removed from the organ farm and the subsequent transmission was in the brains of the infant rats.
The clinical features of the human Corona-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by the human Corona-229E virus, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nose viruses.
The human Corona-229E virus and the human Corona-OC43 virus have spread globally and tend to move over the winter season in a moderate climate.
In general, the time of custody of these viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of disease for almost two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with human Corona-229E has caused a light attack.
Only a few HIV-positive patients showed severe respiratory trauma.
SARS, also known as "LCD," is the first well-documented human Corona virus pandemic in the history of humanity and the underlying factor is SARS-Koff, the third human Corona virus to be discovered.
The first case of Bars & apos; injury dates back to the end of 2002 in Gwangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed injuries and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the hyperinfection carrier, it was estimated that one case could lead to about two secondary cases, with a period of four to seven days of custody and the peak of the viral load on the 10 day of the disease.
The symptoms of SARS-Cove begin to appear in muscle pain, headaches, fever, your insolence, and bearings, and follow them as symptoms of late respiratory difficulty, cough and respiratory distress.
The lack of amphibians, the dysfunction of the liver and the rise of Krithane Kenaz are common laboratory disorders of SARS.
Also, in the patients of Sarin, there is widespread meningitis abuse, the proliferation of visible cells, and an increase in the number of Bulgarian cells.
About 20-30% of the patients then need focused care and artificial breathing.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in extreme cases, many members, including the digestive system, liver and kidney, can also be infected and usually accompanied by a cytocin storm, which may be particularly fatal in HIV-positive patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case of injury that travelled from Guanzo to Hong Kong.
Since then, considerable efforts have been devoted to research on the human Corona virus.
The human Corona-NL63 virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older persons and HIV patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The cold, the immune, the fever and the neural infections are common symptoms of the human Corona-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the virus itself from a sample of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is global.
The human Corona-NL63 virus is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, the peak of which will occur during the early summer, spring and winter.
The human Corona-NL63 virus is associated with hemorrhaging, also known as the Creator.
In the same year, the human Corona-HKU1 virus was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and neural infections in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and neoplasm, the human Corona-HKU1 virus was reported to be associated with the increase in acute asthma.
The human Corona-HKU1 virus was found to be global, causing light respiratory diseases, similar to the human Corona-NL63 virus, the human Corona-229E virus and the human Corona-OC43 virus.
All four human Corona viruses acquired from society have been well adapted to human beings and, in general, the likelihood that they may be transformed to cause diseases with low high prevalence rates, but the incidence has occurred for unknown reasons, such as in the rare case of the most severe sub-type of human Corona-NL63 virus, which has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infection in China.
In general, when the Corona virus has acquired this ability to move efficiently and maintain itself continuously within humans, it is also becoming less violent or ill.
For the first time in 2012, a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and a kidney failure in Saudi Arabia was isolated.
While most of the confirmed cases are from the Middle East, in many European States and Tunisia, cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary movement of people in close personal contact have been reported.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, resulting in 186 confirmed injuries.
The clinical symptoms caused by Merris are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by aggravated acute pneumonia.
Unlike Lars, many of those affected by Merris also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what Merris has to do with the other diseases caused by the human Corona virus.
More than 30% of patients suffer from intestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Merse-Cove one of the most well-known destructive viruses of humans.
During the period from mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients, which were later identified as the result of SARS-2 infection, were discovered in Wuhan, Hube Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the current outbreak of the lower respiratory system due to the SARS-2 virus as an emergency to public health of international importance as called it Covid-19.
On 3 March 2020, 9,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a primary mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Hube region of China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Saris Cove-2 causes severe respiratory infection such as Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove, and appears in the form of fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea also appears in some of the infected.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although Saris-Cove and Saris-Cove-2 are very similar because of the 82% high homogeneity in the Nucletides sequence, they belong to different branches in the development tree of the strains.
Saris Cove-2 appears to be less acute but more infectious than Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove.
It has been reported that there are people with no symptoms, despite the fact that they have been infected by SARKF-2, which may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and variation between SARS Cove-2 and the other six human viruses Corona revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human Corona viruses are similar in the period of custody and the period of time of the disease.
In this regard, SARS Cove-2 follows the general trend of the other six human Corona viruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of the Kovid-19 infection is between SARS-Kow and Verosat Koruna, the four human beings acquired from society (i.e. the human Corona virus-229E, the human Corona-OC43 virus, the human Corona-HKU1 virus and the human Corona-NL63 virus).
On the one hand, the incidence of Sars Cove-2 appears to be more common in cases of human Corona virus acquired from society, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases with Kovid-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-Koff, although the percentage is slightly lower.
Third, the transition of SARS-Kow-2 shows interesting patterns of both human Corona viruses acquired from society and SARS-Kow.
On the one hand, the transport of SARS Cove-2 is at least as high as that of human Corona viruses acquired from society.
On the other hand, the verification of whether the transport of SARS Cove-2 is reduced after the human transition remains as in the case of SARS-Cove and Meris-Cove.
Finally, Saris Cove-2 can be detected in the samples of pores, as in other human Corona viruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the movement of SARS Kow-2 through the oral anal road plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-Kow at least in some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS Cove-2 may show a seasonal spread, as in the case of human Corona viruses acquired from society.
However, the characteristics of SARS Cove-2, including the possibility of transition, and the mechanism of disease and sustainable spread after human transition, will have an impact on the final fate of the current Kovid-19 outbreak.
All four human Corona viruses acquired from society and caused minor symptoms have been well adapted to human beings.
There is another perspective, which may also be true, that human beings have adapted well to these four human Corona viruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old human Corona virus.
The human virus of Corona, which affects human beings with acute diseases, as well as those who have been infected with acute human Corona virus, has been eliminated.
For this to happen, human Korona viruses must be copied in human beings enough to allow for the accumulation of the adaptive mutations that face the factors restricted by the host.
From this logic, the longer Saris Cove-2 continues to spread and the more people are affected, the more likely it will be to be fully adapted to human beings.
If it is well adapted, it is difficult to stop its movement among humans through quarantine or other measures to combat infection.
The four Koruna viruses acquired from society have spread among human populations for many years, causing the flu of people with good HIV.
These viruses don't need an animal warehouse.
On the contrary, Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove have not been well adapted and have not been able to continue to move between human beings.
They need to stay in and reproduce in their animal colonies and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more of the medium and large hosts.
Saris Cove-2 is characterized by characteristics similar to those of Saris-Cove / Merz-Cove and Verosat Corona, the four human beings acquired from society.
It's as contagious as the human Corona virus acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes the disease more than the human Corona virus acquired from society and less than Saris-Cove or Merz-Cove.
It is not yet clear whether they will be fully adapted to and spread among humans without the need for an intermediary animal warehouse or host or not.
Before discussing the animal assets of the human Corona virus, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, warehouse, intermediate and massive human Corona viruses.
The animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human Corona virus if the virus is home to a closely related origin and shares a significant similarity in the level of neutrotides.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and unsatisfactory to this host.
Similarly, the host of the warehouse has been harbouring the human Corona virus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and the natural hosts are the human Corona virus or its father virus.
On the contrary, if the human Corona virus recently enters the middle host before or near the human attack, it is not well adapted to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and play the role of a huge host by allowing the virus to be copied on a temporary basis and thus transferred to human beings to expand the reach of human infection.
The human Corona virus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to move from within the middle host.
On the contrary, human Corona viruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they may settle it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes the natural warehouse host.
The epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the newspapers.
Cast prevalence surveys later indicated that animal traders had a high anti-SARS-KVA prevalence rate compared to ordinary people.
For the first time, it has been identified that the paguma larvata and the raccoon dog in the markets for the sale of living animals carry viruses similar to Lars-Cove are almost identical to SARS-Cove.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no other cases of severe injury were reported after all the butter cats were killed on the market.
However, it was reported that the result of the SARS-Kow examination in the disguised palm butter living in the wild or farm without exposure to the living animal markets was largely negative, indicating that the disguised palm butter could be only an intermediate inflated host, but not the natural warehouse of SARS-Koff.
It is noted that, since 80% of the different animals in the Guanzo markets have anti-Sars-Cove objects, the possibility that many small mammals also play the role of the inflated medium host of Sas-Cove is not excluded.
It looks like all of these are hosts who don't move Saris-Cove.
The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-Koff has led to the detection of the closely associated bats virus of Krona, which is called the herb virus of the Chinese border associated with the HKU3 acute respiratory syndrome (HKU3), which is found in the Chinese border bats of the Chinese border.
The result of the examination of the anti-Sars-Cove objects in these bats and the sequence of the genome of the Chinese-horse bats associated with the HKU3 acute respiratory syndrome was positive.
The virus and the other Corona virus of bats share the 88-92% equivalent of neutrotides with Saris-Cove.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to the causes of emerging human diseases.
Many of the Krona-like SARS viruses (ARV-like Krona viruses) of bats have been identified, but none of them could be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensium 2 transformer enzyme is defined as the future of Lars-Cove.
It was established that WIV1, drawn from a bats sample, was using the enzyme converted to Angelisin 2 in the bat, the butter cat, and humans as a future to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of the recovery from the severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equate WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 virus is the most connected to SARS-Cove in the bats, as they share the 95% symmetry of neutroids.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct father of SARS-Kow and that the bats are not a direct warehouse host of Lars-Koff.
The analysis of the development of the Merras-Cove strains is combined in the group of the Corona-HKU4 virus in the bats and the HKU5 virus in the bats themselves.
The Corona-HKU4 virus is used in the bats and Merz-Cove, the host & apos; s own future, by a diptedel by ptedaz4 (diptedel by ptedaz4), to enter the virus.
Repository DNA-based polymerirez (RNA) sequences of RNA for Mars-Cove are closer in terms of the evolution of the strains to his counterparts from the Krona Beta virus in the bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mars-Cove lives in the wild bats.
Merz-Cove and the Corona-HKU25 virus in his closest bats share only 87% of the neutrotides.
Thus, the host bats may not be the direct warehouse of Mars-Cove.
On another level, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only positive venom of the equivalent anti-bodies of Merras-Koff, as well as of the Middle East in many African countries, are positive.
Mars-Cove was isolated from the human-like anal scanners of the single-slew beauty, indicating that beauty was the host of the original warehouse of Mars-Cove.
It should also be noted that, in general, minor symptoms appeared in a camel that had experienced an experimental Merras-Cove, but that a massive viral dispersion was observed.
The infected beauty was remarkably spreading viruses not only by breathing but also through the oral anal road, which is the main route to the spread of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as to the fact that many confirmed cases of Merris do not have a history of contact with beauty before the symptoms appear, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human-to-human transition or unknown transport methods involving species of animals that have not been identified as harbouring Merras-Koff.
Saris Cove-2, the RATG13 virus is involved in the bats isolated from the horse border bats in the 96.2% neutrotides.
The different sequence between SARS Cove-2 and RATG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-Cove and Meris-Cove.
This means that bats may not be the host (s) of the direct warehouse of Lars Cove-2 unless almost identical Korean bats are found in the future.
The average host animals of Lars Cove-2 are supposed to be among the species of wild animals that were sold and killed in the Wuhan market for seafood, with which many of the initial cases of Kovid-19 were associated, indicating the potential for an animal-to-human transition.
Many recent studies based on the sequence of metagenomics suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as Manis javanica could also house beta-chrouna viruses associated with the Kow-2.
The new Kurona artefacts of this ant-eating virus and the Cove-2 Saris share a 85-92% neutrotides sequence.
However, they are closely associated with the RATG13 with about 90% similar to the levels of neutrotides.
Two sub-strains of SARS-2-like viruses are collected in the development tree of the strains, one of which is involved in a similar area of future (future area of association) connection with SARS-2, with a 97.4% match of the amino-diaphragm sequence.
In a stark contrast, the areas of contact of Lars Cove-2 receptors are significantly different from RATG13, although the entire genome sequence is more similar.
A previous study of a patient & apos; s artisanal ant eater also revealed the existence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turns out that they are also associated with the KF-2.
This study has adopted different methods of collection and manual treatment to generate a partial genome sequence of the virus genome of approximately 86.3% full length.
We can't rule out the possibility that an antiseptic eater is one of the intermediate host animals of the Kow-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the fact that ART is the direct origin of SARS KO-2 because of the different sequence between SARS-2 and VERSAT-KORONA beta associated with JARK-2 in ART-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS Cove-2 and RATG13 is less than the distance between SARS Cove-2 and Verosat Corona Beta associated with SARS-2 in artisanal ant eater.
The development course of Lars Cove-2 in the bats, the eating of artisanal ants and other mammals is still under appointment.
While the highest serial similarity has been found in the areas of receptors & apos; connection between SARS-K2 and the antiseptic ants, the beta-krona viruses associated with SARK2 and SARK2 and RATG13 share the highest symmetry of the full genome sequence.
It is a common speculation that the high degree of similarity between the areas of association of the future of Sars Cove-2 in the eating of artisanal ants belonging to the beta-Corona virus and Sars Cove-2 are driven by the near-selective development.
There is a counter-proposal that is likely to be reconfigured between SARS Cove-2 in the eating of artisanal ants belonging to beta-Corona viruses and RATG13 in third wild species.
The reinstallation is widespread among the Krona Beta virus as a driving force of development.
The direct animal origin of SARS Cove-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to the highly pathogenic human Corona viruses, the animal origin of the human Corona-229E virus, the human Corona-OC43 virus, the human Corona-NL63 virus and the human Corona-HKU1 virus has also been studied.
The evidence of the evolution of the strains indicated that both the human Corona-NL63 virus and the human Corona-229E virus may have emerged from the Krona bats virus, while the father & apos; s viruses for the human Corona-OC43 virus and HKU1 virus were found in the rodents.
The Corona virus in the bats, called ARCOV.2, was reported to be closely linked to the human Corona-NL63 virus.
On the other hand, the human Corona-229E virus was found to be genetically linked to another Corona virus in the bats, called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it was suspected that the parasites were also their intermediate host.
To clarify, current information on the animal assets of the human Corona virus known in figure 1 and table 2 is summarized.
The analysis of the evolution of the strains provided evidence of human Corona virus movements between species across history.
When the human Corona-OC43 virus crossed the species to infect people from domestic livestock around 1890, the respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of human Corona-229E transmission among species is still less clear.
Alpha-Corona viruses in the bats were found to be closely related to the human Corona-229E virus.
They have an Alpha Corona virus in Albaka.
Many of the evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not albaka, may have contact with bats in a common environmental home.
While humans have close contact with albaka.
Second, the human Corona-229E virus of alpha-Corona virus in multiple and non-pathogenic bats in bats, while the alpha-Corona virus in albaka is causing respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-carbon virus associated with albaka has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that Albaka was infected with the human Corona-229E virus of the Alpha Corona virus cannot be excluded from human beings.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to human beings, including dog-disease virus, Ebola virus, Neba virus and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats have moved the human Corona-229E virus directly to humans.
While alpha-Corona viruses in bats play the role of collecting the human Corona-229E genes, albaka and the only beautiful venom may serve as intermediate hosts for the transmission of viruses to humans, as is the case in Merz-Cove.
Merse-Cove gives an excellent example of the interspecies transition, which is moving from bats to one-fat beauty and from one-to-one beauty to human beings.
The evolutionary origin of Mars-Cove of bats has been known since the beginning of their identification and has also been enhanced through subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich combination of viruses to exchange genetic pieces within the same species and move them between species.
The bats are long-lived, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction and strong aviation capacity, all of which are favourable conditions for making them an ideal "virus distributor."
On the other hand, Merrus-Cove has moved to the only beauty that has been sleeping for decades.
It has been well adapted to these beauty so that it has been transformed from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Merrus-Cove causes a very small disease and maintains a relatively low rate of boom in these animals.
His intermittent movement to human beings remains a coincidence and man is an unmobile host for Mars-Cove where his transfer cannot continue.
Unlike the role of beauty in the transport of Merras-Cove, the role of artefacts, if any, in the transition of Sars-Cove-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-Corona virus associated with the eating of artifacts has been severely ill.
They may be non-mobile hosts for the KV-2 of the Beta Corona virus, as is the case of the Sar-Cove butter cat.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities for Saris Cove-2 to move between species of animals to humans either by proving or excluding them.
First of all, bats may be a host of a virus associated with the KF-2, which is mostly the same as the KF-2.
Human beings and bats may share the environmental home through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, an artifact ant eater can be one of the recently discovered VC-2-related medium-sized composites.
Human beings are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming the meat of the pilot.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be at risk of being hit by a KV-2.
There is reason to survey the antibodies of pets and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, there may have been a re-installation and adaptation of Lars Cove-2 in a third type with a connection to bats and the eating of aromatic ants.
The search for the animal origin of Lars Cove-2 is still in progress.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three key factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of Corona viruses to overcome the barriers of species.
First, her mutation rates are relatively high in rebuzzi DNA.
The estimated rates of the Corona virus mutations, compared to those with the other single-chain rebuzi, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average replacement rate of ~ 10-4 cases per year for site 2, depending on the phase of the adaptation of the Corona virus to new hosts.
Corona viruses include the ribonuclease enzyme, which is correct, resulting in a very high potential for transformation and humiliation or an inability to develop.
Interestingly, the remethissevere for the neutrotides is known to be able to suppress the reproduction of the Corona virus by discouraging the external ribonuclease enzyme and the ribozy DNA polymeras based on the ribozi DNA.
The Redexavier drug is one of the promising anti-SARK-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of the Corona virus mutations are about 1 million times higher than those of the hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the Corona virus is not properly adapted to the host.
The rate of mutations of Lars Cove-2 is significantly low when compared with Sous-Cove with a high rate of transformation, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to human beings.
It seems he has already adapted to another host close to the human being.
In addition to Saris Cove-2, this also applies to Merz-Cove, which has been well adapted to the only beautiful sheep.
In theory, genetic deviation is unlikely to help vaccines and anti-virus drugs resist SARS Cove-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive RNA genome in the Corona virus is actively providing an additional code in the genome adjustment of mutations and reinstallation, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species development, which is useful for the emergence of new Krona viruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by unique, abundant open reading and encrypted protein functions near the end of 3 for genome.
Third, the Corona virus is changing stereotypes randomly and repeatedly during the reproduction of ribozi DNA through the unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host like a mixed vessel, the sequence is frequently changed through the rebuzzi DNA versions of the Corona virus.
High-resolution RNA and secondary genomics may re-install to generate new Corona viruses.
A guide on the development of natural regeneration strains has been found in the human Corona-HKU1 virus and the human Corona-OC43 virus, as well as in the animal orona virus similar to the severe acute acute respiratory syndrome virus in the bats and the korona-HKU9 virus in the bats.
The virus's interaction with the transport-related host.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host future is another major factor affecting the transition between species.
In this regard, we are dealing with the re-installation of SARS-Cove as a model example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during the inter-species transition incidents.
Based on a comparative analysis of the isolated samples of Sars-Cove in human beings and the butter cat, it was thought that SARS-Cove was being rapidly adapted to various hosts, particularly through mutations in the area of the connection of the receptors to protein S.
In general, the area of connection of the receptors with the KORA virus interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected extensively through the response of the anti-host body.
In SARS-KU, the area of connection of receptors in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in S1, which is linked to the enzyme converted to Angelisin 2 as well as to the receptors assisting in the entry of the virus.
The area of connection of the receptors in SARS-KU is able to identify the future of the Angelisin 2-transgenic enzyme assistance in different animals, including bats, butter cat, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, the remains of only six amino acids that were different from the viral isolated samples of the human and the butter cat in the connection of the receptors were observed, and four of them are found in the pattern of the future connection to interact with the future of the enzyme converted to the Angelisin 2.
K479N and S487T are found in the connection of Lars-Cove receptors in the butter cat, which can increase the probability of the interaction of the protein Spike in the future of the Anitensene 2 transgenic enzyme.
In other words, these two types of alternatives to amino acids may be of paramount importance for human viral adaptation.
It should be noted that Saris Cove-2 shares the same cellular receptor as Saris-Cove.
There is a 30% difference between Saris Cove-2 and Saris-Cove in the S1 unit of protein S, which implies that the probability of a protein-S connection to the human angiogenusine-2 transformer enzyme has changed.
Indeed, an ultracold electronic microscope study has indicated a 10 to 20-fold probability of this connection compared to that of the human Anitensen 2 transgenic enzyme and the S protein in Sars-Cove.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receiver may be necessary for Saris Cove-2 to move.
It is also interesting that the human Corona-NL63 virus is also linked to the angenotoxin 2 transgenic enzyme, but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other future human Corona virus, such as the protein analyst that is the human Corona-229E virus, and the Sélék-9-O of the human Corona-OC43 virus.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these Corona viruses in humans after moving between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the movement between species for human Corona viruses is also subject to the control of other factors of dependency and host restrictions.
The complexity of these host proteins between human beings and the hosts of the natural warehouses of the Koruna virus, such as bats, single-boiled camels and rodents, may be an obstacle to the movement between species.
Human Corona viruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken their limiting factors to implement a successful movement between species.
In this regard, molecular parameters in this important area of HIV interaction with the host remain detectable and identifiable.
A broad, unbiased genome examination can be used to examine the dependency factors and host constraints of SARS Cove-2 using the advanced chrysotile technology.
The emergence of emerging human Corona viruses: returning to the beginning point
The diversity of Corona viruses in bats offers a great deal of opportunity for the emergence of new human Corona viruses.
From this logic, the korona virus in the bats is a genetic compound of the human korona virus.
In addition, the rapid boom and genetic restructuring also drive the development of the human Corona virus, which are two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encryption genes has the potential to significantly modify viral phenomena.
Among the regulatory proteins of Lars-Cove, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to human beings, where SARS-Cove was isolated from viruses in the bats but found to be encrypting different ORF8 proteins.
It was found that the 29 characteristics of the deletion of the Sars-Cove nickel were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has led to the division of ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptation mutation that promotes the replacement of hosts.
In addition, SARS-KU has been characterized by a history of possible re-installation through the strains of alpha- and gamma-based korona, where a large number of small reinstallation areas have been identified in the ribozi DNA-based polymers.
Reinstallation sites have also been identified at nsp9, most of the nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Merras-Cove epidemic has witnessed reinstations between different strains, which have occurred in the only sleepy beauty in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Cove and Merz-Cove, reinstations have also been observed in other human Koruna viruses, where human Koruna viruses have been installed with other animal Corona viruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection also can help unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from the elimination of viruses from selective pressures, such as through the host's immune system.
The loss of full-length ORF4 protein in the apparent pattern of human Corona-229E virus due to the deletion of two neocleoids is an example of these effects.
Although it is possible to observe the proper ORF4 in beauty and bats viruses associated with the human Corona-229E virus, the alpha-Corona virus that affects Albuka Gers New Calliotide is showing one, leading to the mutation of the framework of the blackout.
Finally but not least, the development of new Corona viruses is also driven by selective pressure in its own warehouse hosts.
Unaccompanied or only light symptoms have been detected when bats are infected with Koruna viruses, which indicates the mutual adaptation of Corona and bats.
It showed that the bats were properly adapted to the anatomically and physiologically corona virus.
For example, the active response to the support of bats has been reduced by the effectiveness of the pathogens of the Corona virus.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity was installed in the bats because of the increased rate of cell receptor, the depressive natural killer NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue conforming compound particles in category I
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (types of reactive oxygen compounds) resulting from the high metabolic activity of bats can lead to both a coronation of the Corona virus and an impact on the correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the development of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is injured.
Additional pathogenic strains of the Corona virus may be created by re-installation, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is not a coincidence that three new human Korean viruses have appeared over the past two decades.
Corona viruses are not pathogenic or cause light symptoms in the imported hosts such as bats and camels.
They copy strongly without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV-positive people are seen with no symptoms and the causes of acute cases of human infection.
The acute symptoms are mainly the result of excessive immune response activity and cytocin storm, where the more robust the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in the case of non-symptoms, the immune response is separated from the reproduction of the Corona virus.
The strategy similar to the separation of the immune response may have useful effects on the ARC-2 treatment.
The Interveron response is particularly strong in the bats.
Thus, the treatment of type I interveron can be used at least in the first phase of the infection with the KV-2 in human beings.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory body of the NLRP3 in the bats is weak.
In this sense, the deactivation of the inflammatory body of the NLRP3, using the MCC950, is useful in the treatment of Kovid-19.
The emergence of Saris Cove-2 follows the general idea of Saris-Cove and Meris-Cove.
At a time when it was discovered that the Krona Beta virus in the bats was shared by SARS-Kow in the neocleotide homogenesis of 95%, there was also a Krona virus in the bats sharing 96% of the neutrotide homogenesis with SARS-Koff-2.
While it was discovered that the butter cats and other animals on the market were harbouring viruses similar to SARS-KU, they did not discover the direct intermediate hosts of SARS-KO-2.
Beta-Corona viruses have been detected in artefacts, which are very much homogeneous with SARS-2, which indicates that the animals of the artefacts may be an intermediate host or that the beta-koruna viruses in the aromatic ants have contributed genetic pieces, which have led to the final release of SARC-2.
Although questions are still being asked, there is no evidence that Saris Cove-2 was made by man, not by purpose or by accident.
The Corona virus has returned to the focus of attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS Cove-2.
The study of Corona viruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our idea of the importance of the assets of animal diseases and the animal depots of human Corona viruses in human transition.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that Saris-Cove, Meris-Cove and Saris-Cove-2 all originated in bats and moved to man through intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that the Bars-Cove infection originated from the communication between human beings and butter cats in the markets, the closure of the markets for fresh products and the killing of butter cats were supposed to effectively end a severe epidemic.
In the same sense, the animals of artisanal ant eater should be disposed of from the markets of fresh products to prevent the transmission of the disease by animals of origin, in the light of the discovery of multiple beta-koruna viruses in artisanal ant eater, which is very close to Sars Cove-2.
However, whether or not Saris Kov-2 has moved to the human being, as well as the way he is moved, through the animals of the artifact-eating ants and other mammals, his transfer remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Merrus-Cove was found in the only beautiful sleep for a long time.
These are an important means of communication as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely disseminated throughout the Middle East and Africa region.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all beauty to control Merse, as did officials in China & apos; s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of Sars-Cove and Sars-Cove-2.
To stop the repeated outbreaks of Meres, a comprehensive approach should be taken to the development of effective anti-Mars-Cove vaccines for beauty, as well as other measures to combat infection.
For our inability to eliminate these viruses once and for all, new genetic patterns may create and cause outbreaks.
There is a variety of corona viruses associated with animal diseases in wildlife.
In particular, Corona viruses are very diverse in bats, which have the potential to cause animal diseases of origin.
There are many opportunities for the development and re-installation of Corona viruses associated with animal-based diseases, resulting in new, more accessible and / or deadly Corona viruses in the future.
The culture of taking wildlife in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary communication between humans and animals.
In the context of the plight of humanity caused by Saris, Meris and Kovid-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that a lot of viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they have an opportunity to spread and increase.
Although bats have many characteristics that are likely to spread viruses, human access to bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if human beings adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to better understand the environment and natural hosts of the Corona virus, which proves useful in preventing their movement from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal viral diseases is to keep the human being from the environmental location of natural repositories of animal-based diseases.
The mystery of the origin of the disease is still surrounded by a number of questions that need to be answered.
First, if the virus bats of Lars Cove-2 were to be transmitted to the artefacts, it was important to know the conditions that had been created for the participation of bats and animals of the cannibalism of the same environmental place.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of the disease to the human being, then the way in which the human being is connected should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of real intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including human beings, bats and the eating of aromatic ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying Lars Cove-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether the host is a debauchery, the eating of artifact ants or other mammals, it is expected that Saris Cove-2 or the father's viruses that are separated from it and that are almost the same as their future natural hosts will be identified.
The ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary course of the KF-2 in animals, with important actions to prevent and combat human covide-19.
The need to update the "suspect case" and "confirmed case" standard in the diagnosis of the Kovid-19 disease
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the new Korean virus, 2019, which provided our experience and provided appropriate reference information to combat the global pandemic.
Although the Corona 2019 (Kovid-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; diagnostic and treatment strategies are thus constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and introduced the new criteria for diagnosis, a "suspect case" and "confirmed case," according to the most recent Kovid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidance (version VII) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Corona virus 2019 (the new Corona virus-2019), now officially known as the Corona 2019 (Kovid-19) virus, was launched as the Corona 2 virus associated with the SARS-2 acute respiratory syndrome.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described Kovid-19 as the pandemic.
To combat the infection of Saris Kove-2, our team developed a rapid guidance and posted it online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's been very interested since his publication.
Please note that although Kovid-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, from the Covid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidance of the National Health Commission of the People & apos; s Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, seven issues were issued in total, with some contexts fundamentally changed.
Our guidance now responded to a comment from Cho et al., who made a simple proposal for step monitoring based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added new evidence to our guidance and also become a valuable reference for this pandemic all over the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated on the basis of the latest Covid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidance (pilot version VII) and recent studies.
According to Release VII (3 March 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case requires a combination of any elements of epidemiological history characteristics and two elements of clinical appearance to achieve a comprehensive analysis, or the verification of three elements of clinical appearance in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a date that includes travel to, or residence in, the city of Wahn and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of covide-19, within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a date that includes contact with cases of SARS-2 infection (with positive results of DNA testing); (3) a date that includes contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wahan, surrounding areas or other communities reported to have been infected during another 14 days before the onset of the onset of the home; (2) a date that includes a number of cases that include, or other (2) cases that include, or that have been brought up to the school, or that include, during the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period from 2 or in which the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period from 1 to the period from 1 to 2 or 2).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics that are established by the screening of the Kovid-19 infection; and (3) showing the total number of white blood cells at a normal level, or a little, or lower than the number of leophagus at the early stage of the infection.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on a suspected case involving any of the elements of the evidence of pathogens or blood serum interactions as follows: (1) positive as a result of the BCR test in real time for SARK2; (2) high homogenesis of the viral genome sequence with the characteristics of the newly known Kurona virus; (3) positive results of the test of the type antibody of the AGM-2 in the serum; or (2) a change of the type antibody of the LCV-2 from a negative to a negative 2 to a positive level, or a higher level of recovery at that level of the acute level.
In our view, the test of the real-time reaction of polymers to DNA in the respiratory process or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) version.
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then the blood serum reaction manual was added to the seventh version.
These adjustments have relied on the ongoing work of researchers to design an ideal tool set for rapid diagnosis of DNA detection, as well as respiratory tract samples, including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and to support the transfer of the positive outcome of the qualitative antibody to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptoms.
Therefore, the content of the information flow scheme for Cho et al., where they have classified a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The step monitoring system also needs to verify its validity in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to find more direct evidence, as we call on readers to provide us with their comments.
In order to diagnose the "suspected case" and "confirmed case," we call for the tracking and compliance with the new guidance issued by the home States.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has five new deaths due to Kovid-19, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to the Kovid-19 disease on that day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to HIV.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDER) of Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, 114 cases of registered injury were active and 33 cases of recovery were living in the home.
There were 17 recorded deaths.
At a press conference on the Internet, the Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirgadi Sabrina Flora, stated that deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mierjadi, there were two cases over 60 years of age, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also said two deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Kovid-19 an award on March 11.
An official at an Anatoly hospital, a local news agency, said that one of the deceased was Jalal Sif Al-Rahman, Director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being cared for at Kuwait Mitri Hospital.
In a video on the Internet on Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of the State of Bangladesh, Abed Al-Kadir, said that public transport would be stopped longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The disruption of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday April 4.
The transport of commodities is still allowed: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of Kovid-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March, for two persons returned from Italy, as well as one wife.
The three have already recovered by March 19.
Over 2 million SARS-2 infections worldwide
Data from the Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of high acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) has exceeded 1 million.
The Kovid-19 disease from the Corona virus caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of the Corona virus, and the first related deaths were recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, from Thursday, it was one of the few countries still free of the Korona virus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) had announced 1051635 confirmed cases, of which 79332 were in 24 hours prior to 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 UWZ) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of Corona virus were recorded in the United States of America, with at least 5,900 deaths associated with them.
According to the data from Jones Hopkins University, CBS News reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by the Corona virus.
States around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Mr. Sergei Sobianin, Mayor of Moscow, announced that the city & apos; s closure period had been extended until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian salaries continued to be paid without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Makkah al-Mukarramah and the city of Manarah to all day; it was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10: 00 to 4: 00 in the morning.
The Governor of Ohio, Mr. Mike de Wayne, announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Australia's stores reduce the purchase of toilet paper for each transaction
The Australian and Wall Words and Coles series on the evening of Saturday and Sunday stressed the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Wall Words and one roll of Coles for every treatment in all branches of the country.
I also identified a single-roll store, which is Monday.
These purchase restrictions were published as letters at the payment points in the store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been stored because of concerns about Kovid-19 in the event that people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Wall Wurtz's stores have established restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to the houses to become a single roll for each purchase order.
These changes followed the previous restrictions established by the Wal Wurths on March 4 and the Coles on March 5 by allowing only four bats to be purchased for each transaction.
In its information statement of 8 March, the Kulz stores reported that, despite the application of the four-roll restrictions, "many shops still sell all they have within one hour of receiving it," the request was described as "unprecedented," as well as by a national store in a Facebook publication on Tuesday as "unexpected."
The sales increased "significantly" last week, according to the Wal-Wurtz spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also identified the amount allowed to be purchased as two.
In order to alleviate the shortfall, Kulz's stores asked suppliers for larger bats and increased delivery frequency, as did Wall Worth's stores for an additional stock, while the top stores made their stock available for the special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Society, said that retailers were trying to increase stock, but the local council & apos; s time limits on the delivery of trucks made it difficult.
Production costs are expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few private offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi's stores announced that as a result of the early availability of stock, some stores would not be able to provide their own Wednesday show.
In a report to News.com.au, Dr. Mortimer, the retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores were filled with stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a large commodity, which led to a reduction in the quantity of stock in terms of numbers and, when fully sold, left large empty areas on the shelves, thus enhancing a sense of lack.
Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News, stated that: "Colz and Wall Worth stores have a view that if many goods are available on shelves, and if products such as latrines and sterilizers can be [purchased] and provided in large quantities, this may reduce panic."
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that its stock was out.
According to the Nws.com.au website report, Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet napkins, and Solaris Bieber, which produces the Sorbite napkins, confirmed that they were working 24 / 7 to continue to provide their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors provided free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because of the buyer & apos; s suspension on the long weekend of the Workers & apos; Day.
The Thursday edition of The NT News, a daily publication in Darwin City, included eight-page advertisements made so that they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
The shops initially hesitated about the imposition of restrictions, according to a report issued on 3 March by ABC Australia; the stores stated that they had no plans to impose restrictions on procurement.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a great demand for other products, including valves, sterilizers, dried goods, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that an Internet-based British store called Okadu identified the purchase of toilet paper by Anders with two of the 12-roll bats.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares Kovid-19 to be wounded.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the continued outbreak of the Kovid-19 disease - a disease caused by the high acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is known as SARS-Kow-2, has reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the gravity of specific cases, WHO has drawn attention to the need for Governments to take the necessary measures:
"All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Gebresos, said: "If countries find out and conduct examinations of the people, treat them, isolate them, follow their case and mobilize them to face."
"We are all very concerned about the levels of proliferation and the alarming risk as well as the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Friedden, the Director of Disease Control and Prevention Centres in the United States, this pandemic is "unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February, it was stated that "no other respiratory virus has been traced from the beginning of its appearance to the continued global spread, other than the flu."
Gabriel expressed a similar view: "We have never been subjected to an epidemic caused by a Corona virus."
He continued: "We have never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new situation is described as permissible following the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) in January to declare that the outbreak of the disease is a public health emergency of international concern.
The Director of the United States National Institute for Sensitivity and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fucci, said, "In sum, things will get worse."
The Associated Press Agency reported that there were at least 12,000 cases of Kovid-19 worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4600 deaths.
The Corona 2019-20 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the Corona 2019 (Kovid-19) virus, caused by the Corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2).
The outbreak of the disease was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared an emergency public health case of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of Kovid-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China & apos; s mortality rate was estimated at 4%, while in Algeria the world ranged from 13.04% to 8.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory distress.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
There's no known vaccine or specific antiretroviral treatment.
The basic treatment is supportive and symptomatic. The recommended preventive measures include hand-washing, oral coverage at cough, maintenance of the distance between persons, monitoring and self-isolation of persons suspected of injury.
The authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and closure of installations.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic turmoil, the postponement or elimination of sports, religious, political and cultural events and a widespread supply shortage, which has been exacerbated by the panic of procurement.
Schools and universities were closed either at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world & apos; s students.
Misinformation about HIV has been spread on the Internet, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where significant HIV infections have emerged.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there was a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in the city of Wuhan (the capital of Hube), China, reported a series of cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons on December 31, 2019, and the survey began in early January 2020.
The cases are often linked to a market and an illusion of seafood for wholesale sale, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as Sars Cove-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the Krona virus in the bats, the Corona virus in the artefacts, and the Saras-Cove. It was later discovered that the first person with the symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear contact with the later discovered combination of the wet market.
Of the early series of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China morning newspaper indicated that a case dating back to November 17, 2019, 55 years old from Hube County, was perhaps the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, although new cases in China had been reported had declined, they had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within it for the first time.
There may be a significant lack of reporting of cases, especially among those with light symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases were reported among young people, with adults accounting for 19 years and 2.4% of cases around the world. The United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of the British needed to be infected before effectively immunized the herd.
The cases indicate the number of people who have been examined in Kovid-19, and their injuries have been confirmed in accordance with the official protocols.
As of March 23, no State had tested for more than 3% of its population, and many States had formal policies on not only testing for those with light symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of Kovid-19 cases had not been detected in China, as at 23 January, and that these unrecorded injuries were the source of infection for 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis, published on 30 March, estimated that the number of injuries in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
The initial estimates for the core reproduction number (R0) of Kovid-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it might be 5.7.
Most people with Kovid-19 are recovering.
For those who are not recovering, the period from the deterioration of symptoms to the death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, Kovid-19 has caused some 97,000 deaths.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were concentrated in over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official statistics on deaths from the Kovid-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have been found to be infected by Kovid according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths due to Kovid-19 may be much higher, as it may not include persons who die without testing - for example, at home, in care homes for the elderly, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of overdeaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Kovid deaths recorded in a factor 4-5 x.
The spokesman for the CDC in the United States recognized that "we know that [the number of deaths declared] reflects a lower estimate than reality," a statement supported by narrative reports indicating inaccuracy in the US. Such a lack of estimates occurs in case of pandemics; such as the H1N1 H1 pandemic in 2009.
It was the first to die outside China's mainland on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first to die outside Asia in France on February 14.
By 28 February, more than 12 deaths were recorded outside China & apos; s mainland in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 States and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options and time taken since the onset of the disease, and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health. The mortality / injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617 / 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the mortality rate from injuries fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from disease, and the rate of infection mortality (i.e., the percentage of those who have been infected (and those who have not been found) who have died from disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and follow a specific population from injury to knowledge of the fate of the situation.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
The Centre for Evidence-based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is in line with the results of the first random test of Kovid-19 in Germany and with a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the estimates of the case mortality rate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massaj Boni of the University of Pennsylvania stated: "The outbreak of infectious diseases left uncontrolled usually reaches the peak and starts to decline after that when the disease does not find available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to reach any logical expectation now about the timing of that. "
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Chong Nachan, stated that "it could end by June" if all States could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of HIV.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Health and Therapy reported that Saris Cove-2 would "be widespread for maybe one or two years."
According to a study conducted by the London Imperial College under the auspices of the world, Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on the physical dispersion and other measures "until a vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)."
William Shafner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think this Corona virus is unlikely to disappear completely - because it is easily transportable," and may "become a seasonal disease - so that it returns every year."
The severity of return will depend on collective immune and the extent of transformation.
The symptoms of Kovid-19 may be relatively undefined and may not show symptoms on the infected.
The two most common offers are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, the release of a respiratory mine (mine), loss of smell, lack of breath, muscle and dissection pain, throat, headaches, shellfish, vomiting, blood drain, diarrhoea, or blue. WHO confirms that almost one in six people is severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
The CDC in the US has limited emergency symptoms to respiratory, chest pain or constant pressure, sudden dislocation, wake-up, face-to-face or lip-to-face. The immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms arise.
Some of the infected persons, who do not have clinical symptoms but who confirm the results of the analysis, may not show symptoms, so the specialists provided advice that persons in conflict with the confirmed cases must be closely monitored and examined to exclude the injury.
China & apos; s estimates of the rate of cases with no symptoms range from a few to 44%.
The normal period of custody (between injury and symptoms) is between 1 and 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of the state of confusion, the proportion of people with covide-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30% and the proportion recently fell to 15%.
Some details on how the disease is spreading are still under consideration.
The disease is believed to be widespread mainly during the combination or through the spray dispersion at cough, sneezing or talking; at the time of mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that cough without oral coverage may result in a spray ranging from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some consider that the virus may also be transmitted through long-term air spray, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce respiratory spray during the process of exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transported by air.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of close people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as pneumonia and cardiovascular recovery (CBR), may cause respiratory discharge to be released in the form of a spray and thus cause the spread by air.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the potential for the spread of leopard to mouth, it is believed that the risk is limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of Saris Cove-2 moving from poop to mouth. The virus is more infectious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and at subsequent stages of the disease.
People were proven to have been infected up to three days before the symptoms appeared, indicating that there was a possibility of moving before severe symptoms appeared.
There are few reports of cases without laboratory confirmed symptoms, but a no-symptoms transition has been identified by some countries during the follow-up surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that although there is some ambiguity about the ease of the disease's spread, one person can count from two to three people in general. The virus remains on the surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel resistant to the rust of 304, one day on paper and up to four hours on copper.
However, this is different based on humidity and temperature. It has been confirmed that the pets and other animals have been infected with Kovid-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, yet the British authorities are advised to wash hands after the animal mucus, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by one of the injured.
The Corona 2 virus associated with SARS-2 is an emerging virus, with the first time isolated from three people suffering from pneumonia mixed with a group of acute respiratory infections in Wahan.
Outside of the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, where its prevention is dissolved. The SARS-Kow-2 virus is closely linked to the original SARS-Cove virus.
He thinks he has an animal origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the Corona virus meets genome with the sex of the beta Corona virus and falls under the subsex of the Corona Sarby virus (strain B) as well as two strains of bats.
96% at the entire genome level corresponds to other samples of Corona virus in the bats (Bat Cove Rat G13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequence between viruses originating in the eating of artifacts and human-made viruses.
The comparison of the entire genome so far has resulted in the discovery of at least 92% of the genetic material shared between the Corona Infinite and the SARS Cove-2 virus, which is not sufficient to prove that the Acid is the median breadwinner of the virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although the emphasis is ultimately made through the interaction of the serial polymeras for the reverse version (RTBC) of the infected releases or the computerized CT.
A study in the city of Wahan comparing the interaction of serial polymers with computer-based CT indicated that computer-based CT is more sensitive than the interaction of serial polymers, although less accurate, with many of its imaging characteristics intersect with other pneumonia and pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American Radioimaging College recommends "not to use the computerized CT to detect Kovid-19 or to consider it a preliminary diagnostic examination of the disease."
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-2, for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of the ERTBC chain in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally carried out through a nostrils scanner, and can also be used as a slate of the throat. A number of laboratories and companies are developing oncological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to be widely used.
A serum test developed by Silex has been approved for emergency use in the United States only in certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the radiometric and C.T. images of people with symptoms of disease include an unparalleled orthopaedic, such as the scaffolding glass fists and a distorted crystals.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of the results of the confirmed cases.
Radiological imaging without a serial polymer reaction is a limited procedure for the detection of Kovid-19, because of its interplay with other diseases such as the infection of the agri-virus.
A large study in China compared the results of the CT and the reaction of the serial polymers and proved that, although the imaging was less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it was faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it be considered a screening tool in the endemic areas.
The synthetic intelligence-based interactive neurons have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in both radiation and computer-based CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining quality personal hygiene in general, hand-washing, avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands, and using a cough or sneeze napkin and then disposing of it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those already infected were advised to wear a medical mask in public places.
A number of Governments have also prohibited unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak of the disease or have advised against travel.
However, HIV has reached the point of spread throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health-care providers, who take care of a potential person, are advised, using considered measures, mixing precautions, and eye protection.
The use of mobile-phone-based positioning data by Governments has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations making a statement calling for the restriction of such control.
Many mobile phone applications have been designed or put for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than 12 specialized groups have worked to find privacy-sensitive solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the extent to which the user is close to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person who has been found to be infected with Kovid-19, promoting false concepts about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal and gypsy washing is not a viable solution.
There is still no Kovid-19 vaccine, although many organizations have been working on the production of a vaccine.
Hand-washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after the nose, cough or sneeze is undone.
This is because domestic soap kills the virus out of the body; it destroys its protective fences.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended the use of a hand sterile containing at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be cleared using several amputations (within one minute of the discharge on the surface of steel resistant to the robe), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100% and sodium-0.1%, hydroxide 0.5% and idopovine 0.2-7.5%.
There are other dilemmas, such as benzconium chloride and chlorhyxydine gluconate, less effectively.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected of being infected with Kovid or confirmed in a facility as a care centre or office, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATM devices used by the patient must be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and nose at cough or sneeze either by decorating the elbow and putting it in front of the mouth and nose or using a paper napkin and immediately eliminating any napkins.
Those who are likely to be infected are recommended using medical masks, as the mask & apos; s wearing reduces the amount of the respiratory spray and the distance it cuts when it is dispersed by talking, sneezing and cough.
WHO has issued instructions on the timing and use of masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist at the University of Leeds, "it can be reduced to wear a mask of the will of [people] to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned." Those who take care of people who are likely to be infected with the disease are recommended using masks.
WHO recommended that masks be worn only if they are exposed to high risk of injury, such as those taking care of Kovid-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The CDC in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical-face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks, particularly in the case of people (1 m (3) feet or less) directly.
Hong Kong recommends the wearing of a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make masks of cloth in the house and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited access to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has committed anyone who enters a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, called on train passengers and city-to-city buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when it comes out, with a recommendation to make face masks at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also known as physical segregation) includes measures to combat infection, which are aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing the intermingling of individuals.
The roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; the closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
Individuals can apply social segregation methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging unsolicited greetings, and being physically separated from others.
Many Governments are currently imposing or recommending social exclusion in areas affected by the spread of the disease.
The maximum assembly size recommended by United States government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 persons (if no deployment of Kovid-19 is detected in the region) to 50 persons, and later 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings for more than two people. Older persons and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and weak immune systems are facing an increased risk of serious diseases and complications and may be advised by the CDC to stay home as far as possible in areas of inter-community disease.
The use of the term "social exclusion" has led to the suggestion that persons must engage in full social isolation, rather than encourage them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidance for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations that only a person with whom she lives who is not HIV-positive or suffering from symptoms should have sex.
Self-isolation in the home is recommended for those who are infected with Kovid-19 and those who are suspected of being injured.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation, and several Governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in affected areas.
The most powerful self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those most at risk.
Those who have worked with a Covid-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or area where the infection is widely transmitted have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from another possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling the spread of the disease are containment or curbing and reducing the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak of the disease and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected and at introducing other measures to combat infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease becomes impossible to contain, efforts are then directed at the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health-care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken at the same time.
Constraints require more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regeneration to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of infectious diseases is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, while known as the surfing of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of stress on health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the spread of the disease include personal preventive measures, such as hand-cleaning, mask-wearing and self-quarantine; community-based actions aimed at physical dislocation such as school closure and the abolition of major group events; community solidarity to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as the cleaning of surfaces. More stringent actions have been taken to contain the outbreak in China as soon as the severity of the disease becomes clear, such as the application of quarantine to entire cities and the imposition of a strict travel ban.
Other States have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced group tests and local quarantine and issued alerts on the movement of the infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to the injured who have isolated themselves and imposed significant fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has criminalized the acquisition of medical supplies. The simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce the peak demand for health care by 2 / 3 and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress in health systems.
Constraints may be preferable but must be maintained as long as the virus is spread in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if first this happens), as the transition on the other hand is rapidly reverting when measures are reduced.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic is causing social and economic costs.
There are no specific approved antiretroviral drugs for Kovid-19, but development efforts are under way, including testing of existing medicines.
The use of non-prescription cold treatment drugs, the drinking of liquids and rest may help to reduce the symptoms.
Based on the severity, it may be necessary to treat oxygen, intravenous fluids and respiratory support.
The use of stimulants may exacerbate results.
Many of the vehicles previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are subject to screening for use in the Kovid-19 treatment.
WHO also stated that some "traditional and domestic treatments" could provide a mitigation of the symptoms caused by SARS Kovid-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health-care centres to provide for the needs of Cauvid-19 patients have been described by WHO as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on the Kovid-19 test, the elimination of optional procedures where possible, the separation and isolation of persons with Kovid-19, increased focused care capacity through staff training and an increase in the number of available prosthetic and beds.
There are multiple theories about where the first case arose (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new Corona virus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Bhobe, China.
In a month, the number of cases of the Corona virus in Hobe has gradually increased.
These were often associated with a market and an illusion of seafood for wholesale sale, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species; in other words, it has animal origin. An unknown pneumonia group was observed on 26 December and was treated by Dr. Zhang Geshian at the Hube District Hospital, which informed the CDC in Jianghan Bohan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of "Corona virus like Saris."
The police directed an alarm to eight of these doctors, including Lee Wayne Liang, to spread false rumours, and another doctor, Ivin, was reprimanded by her superiors to raise the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notification on December 31 and reported to the World Health Organization.
Sufficient reported cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wahan, which led them to start the investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus moved to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during the New Chinese Year & apos; s capital and for the being and the Han of a transport centre and the main railway crossing point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shanghai.
As of March 26, the US and Italy have exceeded the world's most confirmed cases. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dead and more than 364,000 recovered.
Some 200 States and territories have registered at least one case.
Because of the Europe pandemic, many countries in the Schengen region have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as home-based orders, stay-at-home orders, closure) and curfews. As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, have been closed in the United States, more than 50 million have been closed in the Philippines, about 59 million have been closed in South Africa, and 1.3 billion have been closed in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were subjected to a form of closure, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about one third of the world & apos; s population.
The first confirmed case of Kovid-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicated that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Gishian noted a series of cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 26, and subsequently informed her hospital about the disease control centre in Jianghan Bohan on December 27.
The first genetic test of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated that there was a Corona virus that looked like Saris.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed.
With these notices in place, the doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak of the disease.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of a move from one person to another.
In late January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign that was later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jin Ping as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
While it was described as the "largest quarantine in human history," a health collar was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wahan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hobe, affecting some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
New Chinese New Year's celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Hoshinchan hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, a hospital in Chechnya, to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference and playground centres, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the Kovid-19 outbreak, including the provision of health announcements to travellers and the extension of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Telecommuting measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been imposed on both inside and outside Hobbi.
Public transport has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement has been controlled in several cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to an exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict action to prevent "bringing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory health stone on all returnees from other countries. On 23 March, one local case has moved on China's mainland over the past five days, through a passenger returning to Guanzo from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, the President of the Chinese State Council told me that the prevalence of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China had declined.
The travel restrictions in Hube were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wahan, two months after the closure was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that visa holders or residence permits had been suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details as to when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and provided a set of monetary incentives to companies. The State Council declared a three-minute mourning day beginning on April 4, at 10: 00, in conjunction with the Ching Ming Festival, although the central government called on families to show respect over the Internet, taking into account the physical distance to avoid the Kovid-19 outbreak again.
The move of Kovid-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Diego of a new religious movement known as the Church of Chinchyongi Jesus.
It is suspected that the Shenchyongi followers who visit Diego from Wahan are the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people or about 13% of the 9,336 members of the church reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest levels of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were subjected to quarantine after the tests confirmed that three soldiers had been infected with the virus.
South Korea has implemented a programme that has been considered the world's largest and best organized to examine people for the virus, isolate any injured, and track down those who have been mixed up and subject to quarantine.
The methods of testing included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile phone application, HIV testing on people within their cars, with test results available the following day, and increased testing capacity to reach 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's programme is a success in controlling the outbreak, although quarantine is not applied to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided around President Moon Jae In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either claim to isolate Moon, alleging abuse by the Government of the spread of the disease, or are commended for his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the least total cases in one day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that, as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to two weeks of stone.
According to information reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to assist in the testing of the virus.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-Kov-2 on February 19 in Qim, where two people died later on the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early actions announced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural events and sports actors, Friday prayers, the closure of universities, higher education institutes and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to stone areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be isolated.
Plans to reduce urban travel were announced in March, despite the continued heavy inter-city traffic prior to the new Persian year of Norris.
Shia shrines remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became a centre of spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of allegations of Iran & apos; s proliferation, more than 10 States have followed their case from Iran as of 28 February, which indicated that the extent of the outbreak may exceed the 388 reported by the Iranian Government to date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with HIV on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful opposition, as well as to temporarily release qualified prisoners.
There was a high risk of the spread of the virus in closed areas such as detention facilities, which also lacked adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government announced 100 deaths in one day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials died of the disease by 17 March.
By March 23, Iran had registered 50 new cases per hour, and one death every 10 minutes due to the Corona virus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times as many as has been announced.
It is also believed that American sanctions against Iran may affect the financial capacity of the State to respond to the spread of the virus.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for the easing of economic sanctions against States most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when the SARS-Cove-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came positive.
The cases began to increase sharply, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
An unconnected group of Kovid-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on February 21. On February 22, the Cabinet announced a new law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Jozipe Conte said, "No access to or exit from the areas of the outbreak will be allowed.
"On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, where the deaths in Italy were 100.
All major sports events, including first-class football games, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports actors were fully suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarket and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian School of anesthesia, tranquillity, recovery and focused care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics with respect to screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy outlived China as the country with the largest number of deaths associated with the Corona virus in the world after 3,405 deaths were reported due to the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, confirmed cases amounted to 12.948, deaths to 15,887, and the recovery of 2,815 in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardia region.
CNN indicated that a combination of a large number of older persons and the inability to test all people living with HIV so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom & apos; s response to HIV for the first time had emerged as the most predictable among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government had not imposed any form of social exclusion or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism of its perceived lack of speed and severity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising that unnecessary travel or social dislocation be avoided, proposing that people work from home as quickly as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and sports halls as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of the workers' wages up to £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in time of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social exclusion measures, with more than two groups being banned and travel and activity outside the home was restricted except for the most necessary.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions have been implemented by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersion of assemblies.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of "necessary" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, gas stations and customs.
On January 20, the first known case of the Kovid-19 virus was confirmed in Washington, North-West Pacific for a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Task Force against the Corona virus was prepared on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump Department declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on the entry of passengers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centre for Disease Control - the lead public health institute of the United States Government - announced that it had developed its own test set.
Although doing so, the United States slowed down the test, blocking the real extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test destroyed a flawed test group produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of federal government approval of non-governmental test groups (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restricted criteria for persons to qualify for testing until early March (the doctor's order was then required).
By February 27, Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, the Atlantic reported that he had conducted less than 14,000 tests.
On March 22, Associated Press stated: "Many people who have suffered symptoms and have a doctor order for hours or days to test." After the first reported death in the United States in Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Ensley declared a state of emergency, a procedure that was quickly followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle City dropped out on March 3, and by mid-March, schools were closed all over the country. On March 6, 2020, the US was informed of expectations about the impact of the new Corona virus on the country by epidemiologists at the University of Imperial College of London.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Corona HIV Preparedness and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.
Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, cancelled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
On March 11, Trump declared travel restrictions on most Europe, except the United Kingdom, for 30 days, as of March 13.
The following day, the restrictions were extended to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which made it possible to use federal funds to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their working hours throughout the United States in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic was confirmed in all 50 states and in the province of Colombia. On 23 March, there were 10,700 reported cases of Corona virus in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the Governor said that social exclusion seemed to have been successful, with estimates showing a slowdown in cases from 2.0 to 4.7.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, 672 people died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of Corona were reported in the United States than any other country in the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports on March 30, United States President Trump decided to extend the social exclusion directives until April 30.
On the same day, the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, was set up in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the Corona virus within 24 hours.
In New York State, there were over 100,000 cases on April 3. The White House was criticized for threatening and controlling the circulation of news by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public data and HIV publications with the office of Vice-President Mike Bence.
Trump's management of the crisis did not have an overall favour, creating a broad cross-party polarization.
Some United States officials and commentators have criticized the United States & apos; reliance on the import of necessary materials, including basic medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict proliferation patterns and was published in the travel medicine magazine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Union 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as famous destinations for travelling from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered more capable. Australia issued its emergency response plan for the new Corona virus (Kovid-19) on 7 February.
It stated that much had not yet been discovered about the Kovid-19 virus, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a state of emergency for human biosecurity was declared in Australia.
In view of the impact of effective quarantine on public transport in Wahan and Hobe, several States have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the region, primarily through charter flights from their countries of origin, with Chinese authorities providing permits.

A medical examination was conducted before leaving, and four Africans from the South who had been marked by the Corona virus were left to mitigate the risks.
The South was returned to Africans whose test results were only negative.
The results of the test proved that the South were Africans, including the aviation crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a preventive measure, remained under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch resort for 14 days, were not injured.

Canada also donated medical supplies. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about the masks and test groups made in China.
For example, Spain has withdrawn 58,000 of China & apos; s only 30% Korean HIV test kits, and in the meantime the Netherlands has returned 600,000 of China & apos; s flawed face masks.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were believed to be from China, but were in fact from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed the good receipt of Chinese assistance. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the outbreak of SARS between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of the blackout that had hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central Government provided "regular updates to avoid panic before the New Year's break."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply the transport ban in Wahan, the representative of WHO, Gordon Galia, noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation by WHO," it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in a highly concentrated place" and described it as "unprecedented in public health history." On 30 January, after confirmation of the transition from one person to another outside China, and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international interest (BECC), which has been the first-ever-seen as an international public health emergency in 2009, the first-ever-ever-to-become a-present case event event event of the global influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the fact that the outbreak was a public health emergency is of international concern is due to the "global proliferation risk, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessarily inconsistent with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend trade and mobility reduction."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that "have no systems to detect people living with HIV, even if they appear."
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our power is measured by the power of the most vulnerable of us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a great price later." On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO), at a press conference, called Kovid-19, called the disease.
On the same day, Tedris stated that United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been prepared, which has allowed the entire United Nations response to be coordinated, and WHO will allow it to "focus on health response, while the experience of other agencies can be used to learn about the social, economic and broader development implications of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was prepared to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local governance and to assess "the severity and mobility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of the response activities at the district and city levels, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO announced that "the world must do more to prepare for the potential Korean HIV pandemic," noting that it is premature to be described as a "disaster," but that States should be in a "preparedness phase."
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the Korona threat would rise from "high" to "very high," which is its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned him, in a statement to him, that "this is a real test for every government on Earth: so we have to prepare.
This virus may be on its way and you must be prepared for it, "and he urged that the right response measures be taken that could help the world avoid" worse. "
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify public health officials to declare the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we accept essentially that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of a virus as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO "is deeply concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and at the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has faced severe criticism of what is perceived as an inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of HIV as a pandemic.
The violent reactions of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) included a petition for his resignation, which was signed by 733,000 persons as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts confirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the Kovid-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons belonging to minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in very poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the Kovid-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
One of the policies of strengthening health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the digital axis includes a State policy tracking tool, aimed at helping countries learn from each other and facilitating a coordinated global response to the Corona virus.
The Chinese Government was criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Goff, and the President of Brazil, Jair Polsonaro, Edward Bolsonaro, for the manner in which it dealt with the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hube.
A number of CBC directors at a number of sectors were dismissed because of their treatment of quarantine efforts in central China, in a reference to discontent with the political institution & apos; s response to the spread in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jin Ping, from the public & apos; s discontent with the spread of the Corona virus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Chao Lijian, have rejected a previous recognition that the outbreak of the Corona virus began in Wuhan, in favour of the conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy in relation to the Kovid-19 virus.
The United States Administration of Donald Trump described the Corona virus as "a Chinese virus" or "a virus and an illusion," saying that China "imposed an inversion of the news that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic," which some critics criticized for being a racist "and that" attention "departs from its management's failure to contain the disease."
Dili Pest has a United States government telegram reviewing the communications scheme with clear sources in the National Security Council, with a strategic statement that "everything is about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "News sources such as Politko, Forin Polisi and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send assistance to HIV-affected countries were part of a propaganda drive to global impact.
The European Union Foreign Policy Officer, Josip Burrell, warned of the existence of a "political geographical component that includes a conflict of influence through the practice of circumventing and policies of generosity."
Burrell also said, "China is strongly paying a message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions for Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while according to the latter, it was sending assistance to the last two States.
The United States sanctions banned the donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba by Jack Ma on April 3.
The United States authorities were also accused of transferring assistance to other countries to their country.
There were masks disputes reported among other States, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respiratory devices destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union & apos; s lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the Corona virus.
The Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, Moritsu Masari, said that "it was China that responded only bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Jozipi Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military paramedics, special cleaning vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa reported a "high-level political source" whose name was not mentioned as 80% of Russia's assistance was "useless or low-benefit to Italy."
The source accused Russia of launching a "geographical political and diplomatic" attack.
The President of Lombardi, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi de May, denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for Kremlin Dmitry Peskov said that "When helping his American colleagues, Putin assumes that when American companies that manufacture medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to repay the beauty if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercises of the "2020 cannons" will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war manoeuvre since the end of the cold war on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the training of 2020 guns: "In the current public health crisis, training not only endangers the lives of troops from the United States and many of the participating European countries, but also the people of the countries in which they are going to be conducted." The Iranian Government has been severely affected by the virus, with some 20 members of Parliament as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani wrote a public message to world leaders on 14 March 2020 requesting assistance, saying that his country was fighting the spread of the disease because of lack of access to international markets as a result of American sanctions against Iran. The outbreak raised calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health financing.
Political analysts expected that this could adversely affect Donald Trump & apos; s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated because of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan had declared that any person from South Korea would be placed in quarantine at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the isolation of Moon because of their claim that the Government had mishandled or commended the response to the outbreak, which allowed States to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this might allow Governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Victor Orban, to rule by an indefinite decree, to suspend the Parliament as well as the elections and to punish those who had published false information about the virus and to deal with the crisis by the Government.
The outbreak of the Corona virus, which led to many supply shortages, was blamed for the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven procurement, and the disruption of plant operation and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Medical Department issued warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Many areas have also witnessed a panic-driven purchase, which has led to the absence of shelves from basic grocery materials such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, which has caused a lack of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned against delays in electronic goods shipments.
According to the statements of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedris Adhanom, the demand for personal protection tools has been 100 times greater.
This demand has increased prices up to 20 times the normal price and has also caused medical supplies to be delayed by between four and six months.
It also caused a lack of personal protection tools around the world, with WHO warning that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diago markets to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread Kovid-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
China and Italy & apos; s actions to combat the storage and illicit trade of vital products have been successful in avoiding the acute shortage of food expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant decline in its agricultural production, but prices may rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
The food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wohan City, while Chinese government officials released the pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep stocks of such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: according to an information report on 16 March, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by Government actions to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As China & apos; s main mainland is a major economic and industrial centre, it has been observed that the spread of the virus is a major and destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris expected the Economic Intelligence Unit to remain volatile so that a clearer picture of the potential results can be found.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic effects of the epidemic on global growth could go beyond those that had occurred as a result of a severe outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, estimated that the global supply chain had been affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reported to have experienced a "imbalance" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to reduced demand from China.
World stock markets declined on February 24 due to the significant increase in the number of covide-19 cases outside China's mainland.
On February 27, owing to growing concerns about the spread of the Corona virus, several American equity indicators were recorded, including Nassadak-100, Standerd and Burz 500, and the average of Daw Jones Industrial has been the largest decline since 2008, with a decrease of 1.191 points, the largest decline in one day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three indicators have ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, the Rating GMBH Sep confirmed China & apos; s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
The shares were back down because of concerns about the Corona virus, and it was the largest decline on March 16.
Many believe that the economic recession is possible.
The economic expert, Mohamed Al-Aryan, commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than they were in the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places, including tourist attraction areas, and the warning of Governments from travelling around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to reduced demand, including British Airlines, Eastern China Airlines and Cants, while the British Regional Aviation Company, Fly B, collapsed.
The impact on the manufacture of cruise lines was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and language ports have been closed as well.
The epidemic coincided with the spring-day travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the New Chinese New Year & apos; s holiday.
National and regional governments have eliminated a number of actors with large crowds, including New Year & apos; s celebrations, with private companies also closing their shops independently and tourist attraction areas such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many of the events of the new Comorian year and the areas of tourist attraction have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the forbidden city of Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, and in municipalities and regions in China, the authorities extended New Year & apos; s holiday until 10 February, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country & apos; s gross domestic product (GDP) and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The retail sector worldwide has been affected by the reduction of working hours in shops or temporary closure.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East retailers have seen a decline between 50 and 60%.
This also led to a decrease of between 33 and 43% in the traffic of pedestrians to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to verify the temperature of the shoppers, and the elimination of the actors. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC) estimates, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than those who would have suffered this situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the Chinese rural migrant workers trapped about 300 million in their homes in the interior, or in the Hube district. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Corona virus may cost a loss of 47 million jobs in the US, and unemployment may be 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's estimates. The closure in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to short-term government-supported work plans known as Corzarbit.
France and the United Kingdom adopted the German short-term work compensation plan.
The theatrical arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals - workers and independent individuals - globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector have sought to support their mission (mostly government-funded) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, to maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and to support artists as far as possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, places of offer and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely and their opposition, effectiveness and offer were cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerating effects of the disease have been the elimination of religious services, major sports actors, and other social actors, such as musical festivals, concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also suffered a stop, and the Vatican has announced the abolition of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian repentance season in the Great Stadium.
Many Christian women recommended that older persons stay at home instead of attending the mass on Sunday; some churches made church services available on radio, online or television while others offered worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic parish in Rome as its churches and church prayer, and the evacuation of St. Peter & apos; s yard from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, Jewish church temples, temples and gordoara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants into the holy places in Mecca and the city.
This pandemic has caused the greatest disruption in the global sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2011-20 European Champions, the 2019-20 excellent patrol, the 2020 European Circuit, the 2019-20 American Patrol of Professional Basketball and the 2019-20 National Hockey League.
The outbreak disrupted the plans of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to start at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the effectiveness "will be rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021."
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many Internet gambling sites reporting significant increases in new contribution rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with different musical groups suspended or concert tours cancelled.
A lot of big theatres, like those in Broadway, have stuck all the shows, too.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce work and participate on the Internet as an alternative to traditional direct performance, such as live broadcasting parties or the establishment of Internet-based "ceremonies" for artists to perform, distribute and disseminate their work.
Many Internet maids of the Corona virus have spread on the Internet, where much has been turned into humor and amusing in uncertainty.
Since the Kovid-19 outbreak, strong prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and Asian origin and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports issued in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist feelings expressed by different groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserve HIV or are allegedly receiving justified punishment.
The anti-Chinese sentiment has also been rising in some African countries.
Many of the people of Wahan and Hobe reported discrimination on the basis of their territorial origin.
There was support for Chinese both on and outside the Internet, and for those living in HIV-affected areas.
After the spread of the outbreak in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of Kovid-19, may be under suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have initially signed pressure petitions to prevent Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, Hashtag ChinesedontCometoJapan # Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racist violations, as well as attacks.
United States President Donald Trump has faced criticism of the reference to the Corona virus as a "Chinese virus," a term that the critics have considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from North-East India, who share the border with China, who are studying in major Indian cities, have been harassed by the spread of the Corona virus.
The head of the Bharatia Janata Party Unit in Western Bengal State, Dileep Gush, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that "that's why God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata subsequently condemned these statements, describing them as "wrong." In China, the pandemic led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners were described as "foreign trash" and "targeted" for their disposal. "
Many newspapers have removed shared pages for some or all of their coverage of the Corona virus.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers on open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-printing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory testing of the Corona respiratory virus 2019 (Kovid-19) and the associated SARS-Koff-2 virus includes ways to detect the existence of the virus, where it identifies the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
RTBR confirms that there are viruses in the samples, where the RNA is detected for the Corona virus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-Cove-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases.
The detection of antibodies (vaccine science) is used to diagnose and control the population.
Anti-body tests show the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms have been so simple that they do not have to report or who have not shown symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass infection among the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.
Given the limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of HIV among its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no State examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
With the use of the LCD for the reverse version (RTBR), the respiratory samples obtained can be tested in different ways, including the biomatic-nasal scanner or the mine sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
It is only in the first week of the disease that the RTBR, which is conducted using throat scanners, is dependent on.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to grow in the lungs.
For persons who have been tested in the second week, a sample of deep air sewers may instead be taken through the catheter or the use of cough (kg).
An early BCR test was developed in Berlin in January 2020 with the use of the LCD for the reverse version (RTBR), which formed the basis for 250,000 WHO-distributed test sets.
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenbiotech also created a Powerchek Coronavirus for SARS-KV-2 for safe clinical use and based on BCRR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to be approved for emergency use by the China National Medical Production Administration for a Sars-Kow-2 detection group based on the BCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed a new Krona-2019 (the new Krona virus - 2019), which was based on the RBC-RP-9 for public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions of the test sets has had inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one phase of the test was delayed at the CDC in Atlanta; this has led to the successful completion of an average of less than 100 daily samples throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components did not have confidence until 28 February 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start the tests.
The Department of Food and Medicine approved the test under the emergency use permit. United States commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lap Corp announced the availability of the Kovid-19 test throughout the country based on the RTBC.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostus has made the Kovid-19 test available throughout the country as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the sampling process must be conducted and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Research Centre for Virus and Biotechnology (CSTR) Victor created and produced the Kovid-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Control Service recorded the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that May Clinic had developed a test to detect the Kovid-19 infection.
On March 19, 2020, the Department of Food and Medicine granted the emergency use permit (EU) to Abbott Labs to test the Abbott M2000 system; the Department of Food and Medicine had previously granted a similar statement to your hydraulic, corp and thermo Fischer Saintivik.
On March 21, 2020, I got a similar emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Department for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The Department of Food and Medicine has agreed to a test using the technology to inflate equal-temperature DNA instead of the BCR.
Given that this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Taiwan is developing a test using a single antibody that is particularly linked to the protein-in-the-new Corona virus, in the hope that it will be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as the rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "chest radiation images of low diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of CT [computerized CT] may be clear even before symptoms appear."
The usual characteristics that appear in the computerized CT include the two-side, multi-side, intersectional, unparalleled and backward scans of glass.
The spread under the south is developing, showing irregular spots and intensifying as the disease evolves.
A study in the city of Wahan comparing the BCRs with the computer-based CT with the origin of the current pandemic indicated that, although less accurate, computer-based CT is more sensitive than the BCRR, with many of its photographic characteristics intersect with other pneumonia and pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American Radioimaging College recommends "not to use the computerized CT to detect Kovid-19 or to consider it a preliminary diagnosis of the disease." In March 2020, CDC recommends using the BCR for the preliminary examination.
Part of the immune response to the infection involves the production of antibodies, including IGM and IGG.
They can be used to detect the injury of individuals during a period of 7 days or after symptoms, to determine the ability of the immune, and in the case of population surveillance. Analyses can be conducted at the central laboratories (CNT) or by testing the clinical care point (BOCT).
The highly functioning automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to conduct these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of ocean blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually drawn through a skin hole.
Unlike the BCRs, the extraction step does not need to be taken before the examination is conducted. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Department identified 29 entities that provided notice to the Agency in accordance with the requirements and that they would be able to distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, the Department of Food and Medicine adopted only one test under an emergency use permit. In late March 2020, Euroimmon Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Ebitope Diagnostics obtained European credits for their test crews, which could detect the AIGG and Iga anti-virus objects in blood samples.
The test is completed by several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional BCR analysis of viral rebuzi DNA.
The antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that the antibodies test sets that it purchased were not good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "The Emergency Section will give a sample tube to patients," which will spit in the tube, and return it back to get the test results after a little while. The British National Health Service has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of infection from the infected when they come to the hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors on 2 March stated that it had been able to conduct some 12,000 outpatient tests every day and that 10.700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance shall bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, HIV testing was made available in the car in many major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only the results of positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that from calendar week 12 / 2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested by the end of the week 12 / 2020, with the results of 3,491 samples (6.9%) positive for SARS-Kf-2. In Israel, researchers in the Chevron and Rumam Hospital had developed a method of examining samples from 64 patients at the same time and tested through the collection of samples and further testing only when the sample was found to be positive.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking five days to do so, modelling processes showed that the cases in Hobe would have increased by 47% and the related quarantine costs would have doubled if that test capacity had not been completed.
The Huo-Yan Laboratory followed the immediate establishment of the Huo-Yan Laboratories in Schengen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai and in 12 cities in total throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Omani Assays issued open-source and multiple-transmission designs that could test up to 1122 samples of a patient to detect Kovid-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, the lack of detectable material and its insufficiency caused a situation in the conduct of a large number of tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some specialists to explore sampling protocols that include 98 ° C (208 ° Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to liberate the ribozi DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates was declared to be at the top of the world & apos; s countries in terms of the Kurona HIV test for its population, and is on the way to increasing the test to most of the population.
This was through a combination of operating the test capacity in the car, and the purchase of a high-productivity laboratory with a range that would fit the population from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory was set up within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RTBC tests to be conducted every day, the first laboratory in the world of this size that works outside China.
Various testing methods have been developed targeting different parts of the genetic features of the Corona virus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
WHO has adopted the German Crew Industry Plan, which is sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on 17 January 2020; the protocol of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the US. China and the US faced problems with the reliability of the test crews early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and follow up on the recommendations for testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts stated that the abundance of tests in South Korea had helped to reduce the spread of the new Corona virus.
The South Korean Government has significantly enhanced the testing capacity of private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, WHO called for the intensification of testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the Kovid-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in private American laboratories, as well as in the supply of scanners and chemical detectors.
In March 2020, China reported problems in the accuracy of its test crews.
In the US, "defects" were found in the test crews created by CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test in particular. Spain bought the test sets from the Chinese company Shinzhen Bioesy Biotechnology Limited, but found that the results were inaccurate.
It explained that the incorrect results might be due to failure to collect samples or to the improper use of crews.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would retreat from the purchase of crews that had given incorrect results, and replace them with other test sets from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test sets from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Professor Ach Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits that Turkey had purchased from China had "high error rate" and had "prevented its use." The United Kingdom had also purchased 3.5 million test sets from China, but in early April 2020 it had declared them unusable.
The tests, followed by a quarantine for those found to have been infected and those who have mixed up with SARKO-2, have produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which witnessed the first case of death in Kovid-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, taking about 10 days each time.
Almost half of the people who were the result of their tests were not exposed to symptoms, and all cases found were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new injuries have been completely eliminated.
The 2020 Corona virus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decline in the prevalence rate compared to other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict tracking of congenital persons and restrictions on internal travel, tests and quarantine.
Many events have been abolished, and Singapore has already begun to urge the population to remain at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened on 23 March on time after the end of the leave.
Several other States have also taken control of this pandemic through strict tracking of the insides and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that States that have conducted more tests, compared with the number of deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because they are able to detect only those with light or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct testing or have local laboratories with limited experience on Kovid-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative Kovid-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 approved laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "positive by% of the tests" is affected by the State's policy of conducting the test.
The State that conducts tests only for persons transferred to the hospital will have positive cases with a percentage of the tests higher than the State that is testing for all its inhabitants, whether or not they appear to be symptomatic, as other factors are equal.
Hand-washing (or hand-washing), also known as hand-cleaning, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirty, lime, microorganisms or other unwanted materials.
The continuous washing of hands with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which move through the oral anal road.
People may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as flu or flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. membrane).
The five moments necessary during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after shit, after cleaning the child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing food or dealing with meat, fish or raw poultry and after.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. WHO recommends that the hands be washed:
Before the food is prepared, and during it, and after it.
Before taking care of a sick person and after.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning it up after using it for a toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After you touch the animals, or feed them, or their shit.
The medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
The laundering of hands before the delivery of medicines or medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand-washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, other micro-organisms that can cause the disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is of particular importance to people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand-washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, Corona virus, other infectious diseases, preventing diarrhoeal infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections,
The reduction in infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in the growth of length in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates for respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced through simple behavioural changes, such as hand-washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that encourage hand-washing from diarrhea can reduce by about one third, similar to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the decline in diarrhea can be associated with hand-washing. The washing of hands with soap is the only most effective and less costly way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) in the application of automatic behaviour in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the primary cause of mortality among children under five years of age, with the death of some 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the death of about 3.5 million children per year.
According to UNICEF, the conversion of hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet to an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by about half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Hand-washing is usually integrated with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Hand-washing is also protected from direct physical transmission.
The simple adverse effect of hand-washing is that repeated hand-washing can lead to skin damage due to its drying.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand-washing could lead to a dermal state of peeking and itch known as a hand eczema or a hand-skin inflammatory, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
The washing of hands is also often seen as an symptom of the OCD.
There are five moments necessary during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reducing the transmission of diseases through the oral anal road: after using the bathroom (peeing, poking), after cleaning the child's ass (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, and before / after preparing food or dealing with meat, fish or raw poultry.
The right hand-washing method should be exercised in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, such as before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after the sneezing, cough or nose-cleaning, after the touching or handling of animal waste, and after the touching of the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-washing is low with soap.
A study on hand-laundering in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of families are washing their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 per cent, the US is approaching the middle at 77 per cent, and China is at least 23 per cent.
The "Basic Health Care Programme" implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of broad-based action to promote children's health and education.
The treatment of worms twice a year, as well as the washing of daily hands with soap, and the daily cleaning of teeth in fluoride, are at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soap or cleaners to water promotes the removal of micro-organisms from skin.
The main impact of soap and cleaners is to reduce degradation barriers and increase solubility.
The water alone is uneffective for skin because fat and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily degrade in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to clean up...
Because of its reusable nature, solid soap may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have noted the bacterial transition from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
Centers for disease control and prevention continue to provide that "liquid soap is preferred to be used from devices that operate untouched to pump soap."
The anti-bacterial soap was largely promoted to health-interested consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended pathogens or sterilizers is selected to eliminate antibioresistant organisms in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial factors such as Trikulsan, which do not affect a large number of species.
So, if the anti-bacterial soap does not affect the antibioresistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is being traded to him.
In addition to the surface tension reduction and the skin protection factor, sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, escorpec acid, lactate acid) as an active acid and pseudobenic acid organization (cactus, vitamins, fodder, phytoscopic). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that regular soap is as effective as the anti-bacterial soap of the consumer category containing the trichlorane in and its removal of the alloys.
The hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria is growing much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that maintain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to the common belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no impact on reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A purgatory or sterile hand is a substance that is not water-based to clean hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based and sterilized alcoholic-hand cleaners (also known as a hand-washed, decontaminated, hand-washed or handless) began to gain popularity.
Most of them depend on isopropyl or ethanol alcohol combined with a heating factor such as carbumer (polymer acrylic acid) in a generation, or moisture such as glycerin in in liquid, or a foam for easy use and a reduction in the impact of alcohol-induced drought.
The addition of a reduced hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-microbial activity. Hand-held depressants containing alcohol at least 60 to 95% are effective microbes.
Alcoholic invertebrates are destroyed by bacteria, polydrug-resistant bacteria (gold-resistant cluster microbes, vanomisin-resistant intestines), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell virus, nasal viruses, foetus, influenza, hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcoholic invertebrates containing 70% alcohol through the jaws provide for 99.97% (a 3.5% decrease in logarithm, as in the case of a 35-year reduction in disibel) of the bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after their development and 99.99% (a 4-5) to 99.99% of the bacteria on the hands 1 minutes after their development.
Alcoholic-hand sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against the virus Norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of infection-induced stomach and intestinal infections.
The front and back parts of the hands and between all the fingers and their limbs are left for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam, or the gel dry.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also has to be well-washed, and rub it in both quarters. The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand-washing with a sterile rub, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increasing use of these cleaners is due to their easy use and rapid activity in the elimination of micro-organisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand-washing unless water and soap are not available.
The frequent use of alcoholic-hand sterilizers can cause the drying of the skin unless the rain or the skin moisture or both are added to the formulation.
The impact of alcohol on the drying or disposal of the skin can be reduced by adding glycerin or other rain or both to the formulation.
Clinical experiments have shown that alcohol-hand sterilizers containing rain cause less irritation and dehydration than soap or anti-microbial cleaners.
Hepatitis is rarely caused by the insensitive skin, the pseudogenic epilepsy syndrome, the hypersensitivity of alcohol or the additives in the alcohol-washing materials.
The low incidence of inflammatory skin infections has become a factor of attraction compared to hand-washing with water and soap.
Despite the effectiveness of non-water-based cleaners, they do not work to clear hands from organic materials, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, the inertia of hands, such as soap and water, are not effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, where the causes of disease remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcoholic-free-hand sterile depends heavily on components and composition, and historically its impact has been significantly lower than that containing alcohol that depends on alcohol rub.
Recently, formulations using benzconium chloride have proved to have a cumulative and continuing effect as an antimicrobial after use, contrary to alcohol that has been proven to be less effective after frequent use, possibly because of the gradual reverse skin interactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
The effectiveness of ash or soil may be more than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with micro-organisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
The ash, too, like soap, is a purified factor because it is a alkali solution when it touches water.
WHO recommended the use of ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand-washing method recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
Warm wet with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water be used because existing basins may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
I will make a foam on the hands with a large amount of soap,
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when they use soap only to replace water.
I rub for at least 20 seconds.
The jaw creates friction, helping to remove the germs from the skin, and to remove the jaw for longer periods more germs.
Lift well under the running water.
It could lead to a recontamination of the hands inside the basin.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it dry in the air.
Weak and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, the wrist, the between-fingers, and under the fingernails.
Industrial fingernails and clothed fingernails may contain micro-organisms.
It is often recommended that a moisturized loshen be used to prevent the dehydration of the hands, which could lead to a skin drying that could increase the risk of transmission.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand-washing in developing countries, where water is not available, or both, such as water from a suspended bowl or appropriate holes and / or ash if necessary. In places with limited water supplies (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as "Tippi's tap" and other low-cost options.
Tibby's tap is a simple technique that uses a needle hanging on a rope, and a foot-controlled arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the process of hand cleaning, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public waters.
An increasing number of research suggests that paper towels are more healthy than the electric hand dryers in many of the water cycles.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European textile symposium for the paper-based towel industry, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hand dryers in warm air, and hand dryers in newer air.
After hand-washing and drying with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average by 194% on the bottom of the fingers and 254% on the rest of the hand.
The drying using the jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the subside of the fingers by 42% and on the rest of the hand by 15%.
After hand-washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average fell to 76% on the bottom of the fingers and on the rest of the hand by 77%, and scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of transmission to other users of the water cycle and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which drives air out of the unit at speeds of 180 m / h (650 km / h; 400 m / h), is capable of detonating microorganisms from the hands and the device, and may be transmitted to other users of the water cycle and the water cycle environment up to 2 m.
The use of a warm air dryer deploys microorganisms 0.25 metres from the dryer.
The paper towels showed no significant proliferation of microorganisms, and in 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt assessed different ways of drying hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after the drying of hands:
There are many different hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the paper towels.
The washing of hands using dampening napkins is an alternative while travelling, given the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hands must have at least 60% of the alcohol.
The washing of medical hands became mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian doctor, Agnes Simlves, discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found low rates of infection.
The washing of medical hands shall be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub every part of the hand.
The hands must be left together and the fingers are intertwined.
If there's shit under the fingernails, you can use a rusty-haired brush to remove it.
Given that the germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to heal them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids the contamination of hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in a health-care place is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transfer.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the non-washing of hands is still at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, thus transporting micro-organisms.
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood-flow infections associated with the catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) had published a paper explaining how hand-washing and their savings in health-care sectors.
The draft guidance document for the clean-up of the hands provided by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the clean hands, if there is a need to prove compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization has a "five-minute" hand wash:
After exposure to blood / body liquids
Before a sterilisation mission,
The addition of clean chemicals to soap ("medical" or "microbial") gives an element to the hand-washing agent.
This extermination element may be desirable before the surgery or in places where antibioresistant organisms are highly deployed. When a person's hands are "kicked" for a surgical operation, it is necessary to provide a canopy that can be operated and stopped without touching his hands, some chlorhyxides or iodine washing, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, an sterile brush and another sterile device to clean under the fingernails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires hand-washing and help to the elbow, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
The long period of jaw (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the grill, the water must be prevented from coming back from the cadets to the hands.
After the hand wash is done, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical dress.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use a hand-purgatory before and after taking care of a sick person.
In order to control the infection of cluster bodies in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from manual clearance came from the first 20% of the laundry, and that it gained very little additional benefit when the repeated hand-cleaning increased to more than 35%.
The average rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher than the rate of anti-bacterial soap. By comparing hand-rub with alcohol with hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap for 30 seconds, an average of 26% less bacterial contamination than an anti-bacterial soap was found.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol-washing to reduce the H1 virus and hard-to-hand wiretaps. Measures to improve the hygiene of health-care places may include educating staff about hand-washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-washing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
Further research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different health-care settings.
In developing countries, it is recognized that washing hands with soap is an essential tool at a reasonable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities at home, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to achieve public behaviour for hand-washing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are rarely hand-washing channels near each private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can be the result of inherent habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy of hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-laundering and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
In order for this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in middle-income countries from the lower segment, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand-washing in schools is the "three-star approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to three eventually.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotion of hand-washing campaigns to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Hand-Laundering Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that attempt to achieve behavioural change. Because of the Corona 2019-20 pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of a code for hand-washing.
A few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries and their relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one audit indicates that the promotion of hand-washing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand-washing for human health - especially for people in critical conditions such as mothers who were just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century of two of the two hand-cleaning pioneers: Hungarian Dr. Agnes Simelves, who worked in Vienna in Austria, and English Florence Nightingale, "The founder of modern nursing."
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was caused by the stench smells called Miyazmaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enhance the clean-up of the hands more effectively as an important way of preventing the spread of the infection.
The outbreak of pig flu in 2009 and the Kovid-19 pandemic in 2020 has raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand-washing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing "proper hand-washing methods" were suspended next to hand-washing basins in public toilets and in office and airport buildings in Germany.
The term "hand-washing" means something to declare one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or to participate in its complicity.
It comes from a paragraph in the Bible when Pilate washed his hands from a solid decision of Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase that has a much wider use in some English societies.
In the Macbeth play of Shakespeare, Ms. Macbeth is starting to wash her hands too much in an attempt to clear a fantasy-making spot that she feels guilty for the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It was also found that, after referring to or thinking about immoral acts, people tend to wash hands more than others, and tend to appreciate hand-washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other "remedial" actions, such as volunteering.
The washing of hands for both health and symbolic purposes is described by religions. By using water without soap to wash hands, the washing of hands is part of a ritual that has emerged in many religions, including the Baha & apos; i, Hindu, Tiffilah, hand-washing in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and the light in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand-washing after use of the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Judaism and Islam impose the washing of hands before and after each meal.
Control of Kovid-19 risk in the workplace
Workplace risk control controls are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control control for the prevention of Corona 2019 (Covide-19).
The proper control of risk in the workplace depends on the workplace and the job function, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the risk of disease in society and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be at risk of being infected with Kovid-19.
According to the United States Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), low-risk work involves a minimum of contact with the public and other work colleagues, a situation in which basic procedures for the prevention of infection are recommended, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, taking into account cough and sneakers, and maintaining normal practices to clean and clean the working environment.
Medium-risk posts include those that require frequent or close contact from unknown or suspected individuals with Kovid-19, but may be infected by the continued transmission of infection in society or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the general public, such as in schools, high labour-intensive working environments and some large retail places.
The risk control controls of this group, in addition to the basic procedures for the prevention of infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneakers and the use of personal protective equipment available in the case of a person with a covide-19.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DHS) is a health-care worker and a body-keeper of the dead who are exposed to a person known to be infected with Kovid-19 or a suspect to high levels of risk of exposure, which increases the risk of being at very high risk if the workers are in charge of carrying out the procedures for the generation of aerosols, collecting samples from a known person or suspected of being infected with Kovid-19 or dealing with them.
Appropriate risk control controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
The Kovid-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to take care of others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods required and the ways in which they are obtained (such as non-peak shopping or through delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from the geographical areas severely affected by Kovid-19 may stop. The preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address risk levels associated with different work sites and functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community places, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing staff transmission, protecting persons most at risk of negative health complications, maintaining business processes and reducing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework that is widely used in the area of occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
In view of the inability to eliminate the risk of Kovid-19, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls include separating staff from work-related risks without relying on workers & apos; behaviour, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
PBE is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, proper suitability as required (such as breathing devices), continuous and proper wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, removal, cleaning and storage, or proper disposal to avoid pollution.
According to the United States Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), jobs that include less risk risk involve a minimum level of communication with the public and other work colleagues.
Basic procedures for the prevention of recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account cough and sneeze ethics, including oral and nose coverage at cough and sneezing, the provision of paper napkins and garbage containers, the willingness to work remotely or, if necessary, the organization of successive shifts, the exclusion of workers from the use of other people & apos; s tools and equipment, and the maintenance of routine cleaning and clean-up of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of individuals likely to be infected is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with severe respiratory symptoms remain at home until the fever, fever signs and any other symptoms are removed for at least 24 hours without the use of low-fever or other diseases that improve the symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, that staff members be allowed to stay at home to care for a member of the sick family and that the staff be aware of such policies.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health, jobs with an average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close communication within a six-foot (1.8 m) distance from individuals unknown or suspected of being infected with Kovid-19, but may be infected by SARK-2 because of the continued transmission of infection in the community around the workplace, or because of the recent international travel of the person to a site where the transmission of the infection is widespread at Kovid-19.
These include workers who mix the public as in schools, high-density working environments, and some large-scale retail places. Engineering controls for such high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic wiring, the installation of windows for clients who travel without leaving the car.
This risk group rarely needs to use the respirators.
If a person becomes sick on board a plane, appropriate protection controls to protect workers and other passengers include the removal of the patient's passenger from others at a distance of 6 feet, the assignment of one member of the aircraft's team to serve the patient, the provision of a face mask to the patient or the request of the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper napkins at the time of cough or sneezing.
The crew of the aircraft shall wear medical gloves that can be disposed of when dealing with a patient & apos; s passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the patient & apos; s passenger is suffering from fever, constant cough or respiratory difficulty.
For commercial shipping, including cruise and other passenger ships, risk control controls include the postponement of sickness travel, self-isolation and immediate reporting to the medical centre on board if a person is exposed to fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person & apos; s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure of the clean-up or clearance if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the prevalence in society.
When there is a limited to medium-term transmission limit in society, social exclusion strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, gatherings and other large groups such as physical education, band or canteen courses, increased office distances, the organization of successive attendance and departure times, the reduction of unnecessary visitors, and the use of a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social-exclusion strategies, school drop-out dates can be taken into account. For law enforcement officials who carry out routine daily activities, direct health risks are considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals confirmed or suspected of being infected with Kovid-19 are advised to follow the same guidance as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
In the event of direct contact during detention, workers should clean up and clean up work packages and tools before being re-used using a spray or domestic cleaning scanner, and use standard operating procedures to deal with pollution and to dispose of used personal protective equipment and to collect and wash clothes.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health is of the view that some health-care workers and the body preserves of the dead fall into groups with high or very high risk levels.
The high-risk posts include health-care, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected patients in Kovid-19.
These are at a very high risk level if the personnel generate aerosols, as well as the collection or handling of samples of confirmed or suspected patients with covide-19.
The procedures for the generation of aerosols include weaving, cough-inducing, neurons, some dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The functions of the high-risk body preservative include those involved in the preparation of the bodies of the confirmed or suspected Kuvid-19 persons at the time of their death; those with a very high risk level if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients, including in the implementation of procedures for the generation of aerosols.
The ventilation of specialized negative pressure may be appropriate in some health-care places and the preservation of the bodies of the dead.
Samples should be dealt with following level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients arriving in separate waiting areas be isolated on the basis of whether they are suspected of being infected with Kovid-19 or not. In addition to other personal protection equipment, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of respiratory devices for those who work 6 feet away from known or suspected of having been infected by Sous-Koff-2 and those who undertake air-flight-generation procedures.
In the United States, face-to-face devices with a N95 candidate, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory protection programme, which includes installation and appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide greater protection and improve workers & apos; comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of synergies, because Kovid-19 is a respiratory disease instead of being transported through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect, take care of, or move them without any procedure to generate aerosols, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of a surgical mask, protective glasses, facial protection, sewers and gloves.
If an air-propelled procedure is implemented, the face mask is replaced by a breathing mask of N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends that the need for personal protective equipment be reduced through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with a covide-19, using personal protective equipment only necessary for the specific task, continue to use the same breathing mask without removing it during the care of many patients with the same diagnosis and control and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and discourage the use of masks for individuals with no symptoms.

Theme line: [Kovid 19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
Date / time of transmission: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 Standard Global Time
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in exceptional circumstances this month.
The Kovid epidemic has become 19 things that clearly demonstrate the global human interdependence and the responsibilities that we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global sympathy, cooperation and community-building, which are at the heart of this institution.
The strong friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, calls and talks is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human feeling that, fortunately, surrounds the way we work.
I am very grateful and deeply proud that you are real colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a message to express our appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of the critical importance of the world & apos; s ability to move towards Wikipedia at the present time, and of the strong symbolism demonstrated by the fact that this very important resource remains available on the Internet and a kiss available to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether through the continued operation of the sites, the access of our colleagues to salaries or the safety of our societies.
The world is in dire need of information available in Wikipedia more than ever before.
It is a moment when the positive impact in the world is not only on our efforts, but also on the way it is.
Because of the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Amendments to working methods and timetables
As Robin mentioned earlier, Group G met yesterday to discuss our way and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that debate, we considered what we considered could be an appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the work of the institution during this period.
We have wanted with great enthusiasm to eliminate the stress and pressure, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce the burden and the tasks, that's fine.
All employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily work period is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not about to announce a vacation, and if you're able to work longer than normal working hours, you might add your efforts to the mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get the goods from the groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our most important priority.
We're not following your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we remember it for sure.
No sick leave or paid leave is required. You only have to inform your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If the doctor has a positive diagnosis of the Kovid-19 disease, please tell Brian in the Department of Training and Certificate Operations so that the Department of Training and Certificate can assist in providing support and ensure that your case receives appropriate care from the Department.)
The hourly colleagues get their full pay.
We have already reminded us of that, and we renew this commitment to our commitments to our contractors and colleagues working on the clock.
Each employee will be paid on the basis of normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether a staff member is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many individuals are using action to overcome the pressures that are prevailing in the world around us.
What we can do will be productive in an amazing way, especially during difficult times like this.
Once again, it's about taking care of a person for himself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so he can know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some actions are necessary.
There are also some things that we must maintain.
The site reliability engineering teams, human resources operations, trust, trust and fund-raising (and others) are doing very important work, which may require further support.
We will begin a process in cooperation with all departments to assess the current objectives and turn our focus into support for the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There's a lot of work we should all do, and we're just gonna focus on the most important projects.
Go a little slower now. It won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "double the working time to make up for it" after the pandemic's over.
We're not expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work on new targets and timetables when that becomes appropriate.
What's going on in annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan so as to allow more time to design the budget to allow staff to prioritize critical work, self-care and the care of loved ones while reconciling the situation of those who need or want to work within a schedule of reduced working hours over the next few weeks.
This schedule extension reduces the workload of current planning and cross-enterprise pressure.
We will submit our proposal to the Governing Council next week and will inform delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Status of the Office and exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco might have been infected with the Kovid-19 virus.
However, from extreme caution and prohibition, we have hired a virus-resistant clean-up team to clear all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used the hospital-class virus resistance solution to clear all the surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevators that lead to our own floor.
The building has applied its care duty protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable because the office is well ready until we decide to get back to work.
Our office in Washington D.C. is located in a building belonging to the Wei-York company, which has shared with us its Covid-19 protocol and with all the members of the working group at our headquarters in Washington DC.
As of last week, our office in Washington D.C. has moved to a completely remote location under the joint direction of our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues know at our headquarters in New York City, we have had a discussion on the rental of a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-standing teleconferences know that it may be an amendment, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions were required, thought should be given to how to divide them over a number of days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared and reading material sent in advance.
The video should be made a virtual solution, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate cooperation and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated by an initiative, and a person should monitor the conversation to find questions, track the list of speakers and another person to help make observations (or implement the process of making cooperative observations).
An e-mail should be sent to technical support when there is a need for comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation programme can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.
You can join the # remarks channel in Slack's application to talk to colleagues about the work distributed.
The Human Resources Operations Group is looking for guidance for the user & apos; s comfortable elements based on online meetings, to support the increase in the work distributed through our institution.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of Internet editors Editathon, until the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for the need to delay or modify these objectives.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Bokimedia and other regional community conferences with specific themes.
The global community & apos; s general feelings of grief are mixed by confusion, satisfaction with the clarity and ability to focus on its communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the light of the progress of these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide community space to monitor impact and follow up on all contacts with it.
Keep abreast of the topics associated with Kovid-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC, 7: 00 Pacific Time for the meeting of the Working Group.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer questions and spend time communicating with us.
We are in this experience together and are always prepared to provide as much assistance as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this e-mail, and all other necessary information on Kovid-19 available in Ovis Wicki.
The crisis response team will maintain an update on these pages and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers living in highly affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else that needs assistance, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with the crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an e-mail to Brian Joden, Director of Global International Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes shall be considered as a waiver of the work or obligations that we have.
Instead, it is an understanding at this moment that our work and commitments have become more and more in need of adapting to the situation in a way that we have not met in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, to provide our workers with the support they need, and to provide the world with the service they depend on.
The actions we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time for everyone to help each other and to create space for important work that will come over the coming weeks and months.
We all need you to make this happen, so we need you all to take care of yourselves and your families to be in your best position when the time is ripe for your efforts.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch the face!
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K., Amy V, Brian J., Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), the other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W., Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
ACE2 is linked to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as intestines.
The enzyme converted to genitoxin 2 is countervailing the work of the enzyme converted to genitoxin (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotoxin 2 and increasing the amount of angiotoxin (1-7); making it a promising real estate in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entry for some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
The enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2 is defined as a metal enzyme containing the zinc element and located on the surface of the abdomen and other cells.
The enzyme-converted protein of the Angelisin 2 has a Peptidas M2 range with a secure limb, and a colectri-caroxyli-side chain is a chemical amino acid transporter.
The alpha-2 transformer enzyme is a type 1-type single-pass dialysis protein, and has active enzyme receptors on the surface of other lung and tissue cells.
The outer part of the cell of the enzyme transgenic enzyme 2 is separated from the range through the membrane by an enzyme called Chidas, resulting in the release of soluble protein in the blood stream and then through the urine.
The enzyme converted to genitnisin 2 is found in most of the organs of the body: it is associated with the cellular membrane of type 2 cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the microintestine, and in the abyss cells of arteries and veins, as well as in the muscle cells of the arterial skin in most of the organs.
The rebuzzi DNA transmission of the Agentensen 2 transformer enzyme is found in the brain crust, the scheme, the subtidal area, and the brain stem.
The core function of the Agentensen 2 transformer enzyme is to act as a balance for the Agentensen transformer enzyme.
The enzyme converted to genitensen stimulates the conversion of the Agentensen 1 hormone to the Angenutensen 2 aneurysm.
On the other hand, the enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2 separates the carboxelic end containing amino acid (Vinel Alanin) from Angeotenin 2 (Asperte-Argen-Vallin-Tyrosene-Izoloisin-Hestyin-Prulin-Vinel-Alanin) and analyses it to Anjotensen (1-7), (Hestyin-Asperitte-Argen-Argen-Valin-Tyrosene-Aisoloin-Eisolin-Pryin-Pervianin-Alinin).
The enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2 is divided into a number of other bipebutadids, including [Des-Argenin 9] - Pradrichenen, Ablin, Nurotensen, Dynorphin A and Grinin.
The enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2 is also organized by the dialysis of a neutral vector for equivalent amino acids (SLC6A19), and has a role in Hartup.
The enzyme converted to Angelitensen 2, as a protein through seduction, is the main entry point to the cells for some of the coronary viruses, which include the human virus Krona NL63, Saris Cove (the virus that causes the cancer) and Saris Cove-2 (the virus that causes the Kovid-19 disease).
In particular, the connection of the protein Spike S1 to the SARS and SARK-2 virus with the enzyme range of the alpha-2 enzyme on the surface of the cells leads to cellular contact and the transmission of the virus and enzyme to the inner particles in the cells.
This introduction needs to create a protein S with a protoise enzyme through the membrane, the host's seren2, which is still being tested as a possible cure. This makes some assume that reducing the levels of the enzyme converted to Angelisin 2 in the cells may help to resist infection.
In any event, many specialized associations and self-organized bodies recommend that the usual enzyme-converted enzyme inhibitors and the encapsulation of the future of Angeotensene continue to be used as a cure.
A systematic study and a synthesis analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of enzyme-converted stimulants for Anitensen was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has been reduced among those who have received treatment for the transgenic enzyme retardants of Anguilla and those who have been at greater risk of pneumonia, particularly those who suffer from a stroke or heart failure.
The use of insulated enzyme retardants has led to a reduction in the mortality rate from pneumonia, although the results have been less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia. "
It is believed that the mutant enzyme of the human organism (rhACE2) will be a new treatment for acute lung injuries, which has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as the saturation of oxygen in the pigs with acute acute respiratory deficiency syndrome induced by several fatty sugar.
The half-life of the converted enzyme of the Agotinsen 2 is approximately 10 hours, while it starts in 30 minutes, in addition to its continued effectiveness (time period) up to 24 hours.
There are many indications that the metabolic enzyme 2 is likely to be a promising cure for those who suffer from the non-sustainability of the traditional RAS-based renine system, and in diseases associated with an increase in Anjotensen 2 in blood. There are clinical experiences under assessment about the impact of the metabolic enzyme 2 on the treatment of acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The Kovid-19 applications are specially designed to help track down people in the context of the response to the Corona 2019-20 pandemic, which means the process of identifying persons ("cones") who may have mixed a infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed for the design of applications for the tracking of cones.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that depend on tracking the geographical location of users.
The less private entry alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user & apos; s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they had integrated a function that would support these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and AOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese Government, in cooperation with Alipay, has published an application that allows citizens to verify whether or not they have mixed up people with Kovid-19.
It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, individuals use an application called TaceTogether.
A local information technology association has designed the application, issued it as an open-source application and is to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched the "StopCorona" application, which is based on the use of bluetooth to track exposure to the mixture of potential infected individuals and to provide a rapid response to health-care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, has designed the application.
On April 14, 2020, the application was still awaiting the adoption of the Google Ply and App Store of Apple.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application of the tracking of the two cones was in the advanced development phase, and might become available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France plan to launch a similar application, "StopCovid."
Australia and New Zealand alike are considering the design of applications that are based on the application of the Tacetogoether launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Trees Protocol. Russia intends to introduce an application that uses the geographical visible environment of patients diagnosed with Kovid-19 residents of Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the use of applications is limited to only a small sector of the population.
To deal with concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Corona" applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add their own Corona-related applications to their own application store; this has been limited to "formal" organizations or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of collective surveillance resulting from the use of the Corona virus, particularly as to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the Corona virus pandemic will cease immediately after the threat has ended.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of control.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Control should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and control extensions should include items relating to the determination of the time of their suspension;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes related to Kovid-19;
Data security and confidentiality should be protected and proven on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with outside parties to the law should be determined;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens & apos; rights to address abuse should be provided;
The "active participation" of all "relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. The German Chaos Computer Club and Reporter Hne Granzen (RSF) have also issued review lists.
The proposed Google / Apple plan aims to deal with the ongoing control problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the systems of operation of the devices as soon as they are needed.
Some States have used web-based tracking rather than applications, eliminating both the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was adopted by officials.
However, network-based solutions that have access to primary site data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal site data; a number of privacy systems have been established that use only central interconnection servers (see section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out the tracking of cones.
Instead of using an ad hoc application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and includes such data for text-messaging to potential infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential dissidents, the Government has also made site information publicly available, as allowed by the wide-ranging changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Corona virus that causes the Middle East respiratory syndrome in that State.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and Internet sites. States, including Germany, have considered the use of both centralized and private systems.
On April 6, 2020, the details on this matter were not yet issued.
The preservation of privacy is a applied and successful concept supported by strong research literature dating back to at least 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than dozens of groups of experts worked to find solutions that are in accordance with privacy, such as low-energy plutonium (BLA) to register the user & apos; s proximity to other cell phones.
However, ABB-BT has been a coordination effort that contains both central and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralization-based protocols include a decentralized approach to privacy (DPBBT / DP3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNN, formerly known as CCNs), privacy sensitive protocols, and mechanisms for tracking cone-portable devices (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personal identification data do not leave the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The MIT Media Lb privacy group was developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-keeping techniques when collecting site data or crossing paths and using them to track the deployment of Kovid-19.
Based on research from the report "The Evil Face of Applications: Protecting Personal Privacy under the Epidemiology," issued in March 2020. The Safe Trace Platform of Enigma PC, a company that developed privacy techniques that had also originated in MIT Media Lb, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe-device techniques to allow users to share site and health sensitive data with other users and officials without prejudice to data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a global contact group was established with a focus on what was essentially a similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interchange between tracking and warning applications, a key feature of widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had made the Blue Tris Protocol, which is used for the application of the official government, open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and AOS mobile systems, announced an initiative to track the two cones; they claimed that they would maintain privacy based on a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and a privacy code.
They also published the main technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to put the system in three stages:
The introduction of tools to enable Governments to establish formal, privacy-based applications for the tracking of the Corona virus
This function is directly integrated into the Android and AOS system, as Gogle and Apple plan to solve the problems of use and continuous control by distributing systems first through operational system updates and then by removing them in the same way as soon as the threat is over.
The reintroduction of the property (also known as reuse, reallocation, change of target or therapeutic transformation of the property) is a redefinition of the use of an approved property for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition different from that originally designed for its treatment.
This is one of the scientific research methods currently being used by researchers to develop safe and effective treatment for Kovid-19.
Other research trends include the development of the Kovid-19 vaccine and the transfer of the gas plasma. The SARS-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treated proteins, each of which contains multiple link sites.
The analysis of these associated sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective anti-virus drug that will eliminate the covide-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins targeted by SARS Cove-2 are proteins similar to the two doors, and polymeras of DNA based on ribozi, helicaz, protein S, and phosphorus ribo for dioxin diphosphate.
Hussein Aa and others have studied many of the candidate vehicles that have subsequently been improved and analysed to match their structure with the highest-profile approved drugs, with a view to accelerating the development of a strong anti-SARS-2 drug in its pre-clinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.

The Governor of New York Andrew Como has announced that the New York State experiments on chlorophenes and hydroxi-chloroquin may begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the Food and Drug Department authorized the use of hydroxyclokine sulfate and chlorophosphate under the Emergency Use License (EU).
Treatment through the clinical testing process was not adopted by the Department of Food and Medicine and was authorized under the emergency use permit only as a pilot treatment for the use of emergency treatment for patients who had entered the hospital but could not be treated in the clinical trial.
CDC has declared that it has not yet been determined "the use of hydroxic chlorokin to prevent, treat, dose or period infection of the SARK-2 virus."
The doctors said they used the drug when there was no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York, Lanjon School of Medicine, is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxi-chloroken.
Chinese clinical experiments in Wuhan and Schengen claimed that Vaviberravir was "clearly effective."
Of the 35 patients in Schengen, the results of the test were negative in an average of 4 days, while the period of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given Vaviperaver and the other half received Omivinover.

According to the South China morning newspaper, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about the purchase of real estate. The drug may have less impact in the treatment of the most acute cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to be pregnant.
One of the studies used by Lupinavir / Ritonavir (Calitra), an anti-viral assembly structure of Lubinavir and Ritonavir, stated that the results "did not monitor any benefit."
The drugs were designed to discourage HIV to prevent it from reproducing by linking it to the Proteas.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to adjust drugs to reach a compound associated with Protiaz Saris Cove-2. The scientific community is experiencing a case of criticism about the channelling of resources to redefining the purposes of drugs specifically designed for HIV / AIDS treatment.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added to the experience of international solidarity.
Gilead Sciences has developed the Reddsevere drug as a cure for Ebola and the Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences have then discovered that Reddsevere is an anti-virus activity in the lab against many of the viruses, malignant viruses, and Corona viruses.
One of the problems related to antiretroviral treatment is the development of resistance through shifts that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early clinical studies indicate that the Reddsever estate may be characterized by a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are many current multiple clinical experiences, including two in Cleveland University hospitals; one around the middle-disease and the other around the more acute patients.
There are three clinical experiments on vitamin C on patients who have entered the hospital and suffer from acute illness due to Kovid-19, as well as two trials under the control of the use of phantom medicine (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The State of New York began experiments on the impact of Azetheromisin on March 24, 2020.

The study, which is known as Colcorona, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed by doctors with Kovid-19 and suffered from minor symptoms without having to enter the hospital.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women who do not have an effective means of contraception are not eligible.
Many antidepressants are also tested in Italy.
Currently, low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multi-centre study was announced in Italy for 300 patients to examine the use of sodium enoxaparin for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on 14 April.
Given the fact that Saris Cove-2 is a virus, a major scientific focus has been placed on the re-use of anti-retroviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the March, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Reapaverine: Specialists recommended the use of Reapaverine for the treatment of Kovid-19 in accordance with the 7 of the Chinese directives

Some antibiotics that have been identified by specialists include the possibility of being reusable as treatment for Kovid-19:
Tuselizomb (Interlocine 6 future): adopted by China.
The experiments in Italy and China, too.
The Kovid-19 vaccine is a supposed vaccine against the Corona 2019 (Covid-19) virus.
Although no clinical test vaccines have been completed, many attempts are under way to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-Koff-2, the virus caused, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five female candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
Kovid-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many of the published genome organizations are using to develop potential vaccines against SARS-KO-2.
The requirements of the Alliance on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread dissemination and global access.
In April, the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovation scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against Kovid-19.
The main objectives of the platform submitted to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (DNA) (first phase developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (first phase developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, type 5 food virus carrier)
According to the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Melkin Institute), and 37 other projects have been announced, but with little public information (supposed to be in the planning phase or being designed).
The first and second phase test is a primary safety and hearing test, usually random, controlled by omission, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses.
The experience of phase III usually includes a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and a test of the effectiveness of the disease prevention vaccine, while monitoring the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates under active development (confirmed from early April 2020), 74 have not yet been under human assessment (still under consideration "pre-clinical").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of working on a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate a immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, which is aimed at starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On approximately January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Haniki Shweitmeker, announced that they had begun working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of a oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the Oncogen Laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer with the new inhaler vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the Research Institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and had started testing.
On February 27, 2020, Nugenex Immuno-Oncology, a Genex company, announced that it had launched a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide v. Kovid-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its projects for the development of a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Equipment Command in Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On about March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that they had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for clinical pre-trial and first-stage clinical experience by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerated it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported that it was developing a body similar to the Corona virus with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with human testing plans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian stated that United States President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large amounts of money" to reach an exclusive access to the Kovid-19 vaccine, which was needed by the German Government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a DNA-based vaccine.
The RNA-based vaccine, the NT162 candidate, is currently subject to pre-clinical tests with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive the results of the pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and could start the final candidate vaccine with human tests by fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations (CBA) announced an investment of US $4.9 million in a Federation of Research for the Covide-19 vaccine, which includes the Institute of Pastor, Theis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which has driven the total investment of the Alliance for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations in the development of the Kovid-19 vaccine to US $29 million.
The partners of the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations for the Development of the Kovid-19 Vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different candidate vaccines.
The Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-inflated rebuzi DNA vaccine for Kovid-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of Canadian $275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures against Kovid-19, including many of the vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government has announced approximately Canadian $192 million for the development of the Kovid-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another outbreak of the Corona virus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of PittCoVac reported on the tests of the potential Kovid-19 vaccine in rats, where they stated that "the S1 sub-unit vaccines of the Lars-Kow-2 microneedle gave rise to strong responses to specific antibodies that were used [in rats] from 2 weeks after the vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at Waterloo University announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on the DNA as a potential anal spray.
Using the coordinates, the DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce non-harmful particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce anti-SARS-KF-2.
In March 2020, the United States Government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access the IBM giant computers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, and they are also called unspecified effects.
That means she can have benefits that go beyond the disease you're fighting.
Another random experience in Australia seeks to register 4,170 health-care workers.
Vaccines under development are likely to be neither safe nor effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific covide-19 animal models, such as genetically modified rats with anjotensen 2, other laboratory animals and non-human women heads, points to the need for level 3 biological safety containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Anti-SARS vaccines and Middle East respiratory syndrome were tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no preventive treatment or vaccine for a guard that has proved to be both safe and effective in human beings.
According to the research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of a guardian has been a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against the Middle East respiratory syndrome.
When March spread, it was thought that the research on SARS might provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the March-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East respiratory syndrome vaccine (based on DNA) that completed the first phase of clinical experiments in human beings, and three other vaccines were under development, all of which were targeted for the virus, two for the gypsy virus (Chadox1-MERS, BVRS-Gamvac) and one for the MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have raised the conspiracy theory that the virus causing Kovid-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequence and vaccines for other strains of Corona viruses such as the Corona virus that causes SARS.
The Corona 2019 (Kovid-19) disease is caused by the Corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Kow-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory distress.
Other symptoms may include stress, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat infection, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
Although most cases show light symptoms, some are developing into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly among people during the combination, mostly through the spray spread at the cough, the sneeze, or the talk.
When the spray is scattered during the process of exhalation, it usually falls on the ground or on the surfaces instead of being prepared through long distances.
People may also be injured when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, their noses, or their mouths.
The virus can survive on the surfaces until 72 hours.
It is more infectious in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before the symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of polymers to the IRT-BCRs by a survey of a nascent neuron.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of HIV infection and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary: some authorities recommend that they should not be used, some consider otherwise, and others make use of them.
At present, there is no specific vaccine or antiretroviral treatment for Kovid-19.
Local-level transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People living with HIV may not have symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, stress and respiratory distress.
Immediate medical care is advised if there are emergency symptoms of the difficulty of breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disturbance, difficulty of waking up, or the drowning of the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory system may be observed, such as sneakers, nosebleeds or throat infections.
The symptoms of the digestive system, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been observed at varying rates.
At first, some cases in China have only suffered from chest constraints and failures.
In some, the disease may evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called custody.
The period of custody of Kovid-19 is usually from five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those with symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of the enemy.
The role of the disease holder has not yet been fully identified without symptoms of transmission; however, preliminary evidence indicates that they are likely to contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of the total confirmed cases did not show symptoms while in hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases with no symptoms in the daily outcome on 1 April; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) of these cases had no symptoms on test.
The mine and the saliva may carry a large proportion of the virus.
High-voice is more spray than normal.
A study in Singapore showed that cough without oral coverage could lead to a spray that is scattered up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted through bioaerosols, and the screening of samples of air compounds in the lobby outside the individual rooms has resulted in positive results for viral rebuzi DNA.
Some medical procedures, such as pneumonia and cardiovascular recovery (CBR), may cause respiratory release to spray, and then spread the virus by air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread by fencing, it is believed that that risk is limited, the virus is more infectious when people suffer from symptoms; while it may spread before the symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that, despite some ambiguity about the ease of the disease's spread, one person can count from two to three people in general. The virus remains stuck on the surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be present for one day on paper and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel resistant to robe (ASI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this is different based on humidity and temperature.
The soap and the disinfectant are also effective on the condition that they are properly used; the soap is working to melt the virus's fat membrane and stop its work, as well as to remove the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions are available, such as benzconium chloride and chlorhyxydine gluconate, which are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of saliva were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test the sixth patient had the highest viral load.
The Corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) is an emerging Krona virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome, with the first isolation of three people who were suffering from pneumonia within the range of acute respiratory infections in Wahan.
The new SARS Cove-2 virus shares its characteristics with the relevant Koruna viruses in nature.
Outside of the body, the domestic soap takes out the virus, where it destroys its protective cover. Saris Cove-2 is closely linked to the original Koff.
The lungs are the two most affected members of Kovid-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the enzyme converted to the AC2, which is the most abundant in the second-type solar cells in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface-based diabetes protein called Spike.
12% of the injured people who entered the hospital in Wahan, China, suffered severe heart attacks and were more common in critical cases.
The symptoms associated with the heart and blood vessels are high, due to the physical inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but the acute heart muscle may also be associated with the AC2 receptors in the heart.
The future of ACI2 is a very important role in the heart and is involved in the performance of its functions.
The rate of clots (31%) and intravenous blood clots (25%) of patients in the ICU with Kovid-19 is more likely to be associated with a lack of predictability of the situation. The autopsy of the bodies of the individuals who died as a result of Kovid-19 was found with dengue damage spread (DDT), and the inflammation of the inflammatory ligator containing oral cells within the lung.
Although SARS-KO-2 has been directed towards the AIC-2 visible cells in the respiratory system, COVID-19 patients suffer from severe symptoms of hyperphysical infection.
In particular, it has been found that the pathogens of the GMSF are associated with the only cells of Interlucine 6 that cause infection and acute lung diseases in the Kovid-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a sip on the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The serial polymer reaction of the RTBC is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out using respiratory samples from a nasal smear survey; however, a nasal survey or mine sample can also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples by two weeks and the results are of a simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the Corona virus and spread the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent PCR response test to detect HIV infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether the person has been injured in the past or not) were under development, but were not yet widely used.
Chinese experience on the test has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The United States Food and Medicine Department approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The Chunjnan Hospital's diagnostic guidance at Wuhan University proposed ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The silverware of the besieged glass are two-sided, multi-dimensional with an ambient, unparalleled and backward spread of common features at the beginning of the injury.
There may be a spread under my side and a form of stone relief (the thickness of the claustrophobic barrier with an untimed menstrual membrane) and a merger with the evolution of the disease.
A few data are available on the micro- and physiological pathogens of Kovid-19.
The main findings of the autopsy:
Microscopic testing: neural infection, Tamur infection, pneumonia and pneumonia
Four types of acute viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pneumonia, hypertissue of pulmonary cells, large, non-typical neuron cells, and intracranial infections with a membrane and the formation of large, multi-voluminous cells
Severe pneumonia: My brother's widespread DNA damage with widespread meningitis.
The widespread meningitis damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute blood inoxidation.
Treatment of pneumonia: organization of diaphragms in menstrual cavity and cellular pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Intraits in the DIC vessels; the reaction of white blood cells.
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with much soap and water for at least 20 seconds, exercising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a tissue at cough or sneeze, and that the internal part of the annex be recommended if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended that the hands be cleaned well after any cough or sneeze.
CDC recommended the use of canvas-face blankets in public places, which is partly aimed at reducing the transmission of non-symptoms. Social exclusion strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public groups.
The distance guidance also includes at least 6 feet away from each other (1.8 m).
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of Kovid-19. Given the lack of expectation of a vaccine until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of the control of Kovid-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "the surfing of the curve."
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, cough or sneeze.
It is further recommended that, when soap and water are not only available, at least 60% of the hand sterile with alcohol is used. For areas where commercial handkerchief is not readily available, WHO provides two local production formulations.
The anti-microbial activity arises in these two formulations of ethanol or isobarpanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial pests in alcohol; it is "not an effective material to clear hands."
Add the glycerol as a moist.
Persons receive support care, which may include liquids, oxygen support, and other vital organ support affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of HIV infection wear a simple face mask.
The out-of-body membrane tissue is used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve vulnerability.
Support treatments may benefit those with light symptoms during the early stage of the injury, and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of those who have been taken to hospital because of Kovid-19.
In the United States, focused care and lung specialists have collected treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, the critical case care book available on the Internet.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment was available for Kovid-19.
In terms of symptoms, some specialized doctors recommend the use of paracetaminovine as a substitute for ibuprofen as the first treatment.
The necessary precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of HIV transmission, especially in health-care settings, when carrying out actions that may result in spray, such as hand-held inhalation or breathing.
For health-care specialists taking care of the Kovid-19 infected, CDC recommends that the person be placed in the isolation room from air-borne infection (AIR), in addition to the use of standard precautions, mixing and air-borne disease precautions.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment, breathing device or mask, eye protection, and medical gloves are best used (instead of face masks) as they become available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial enterprises, but the Food and Drug Department authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (EU).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological factor is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facebook, or home-made masks as the last solution.
The most cases of Kovid-19 are not so degraded that they require industrial breathing or alternatives, but some cases need to.
The type of respiratory support provided to those suffering from the respiratory failure associated with Kovid-19 for those in hospitals is under active study, with some evidence that a high-flow nose or positive two-level air-flow pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether either of these options would be of the same benefit to those in a critical situation.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas industrial breathing when it is available because this technology limits the spread of aerosols compared to the high-flow nose bottle. Critical cases are high among older persons (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds for the population, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden increase in the number of serious cases of Kovid-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were introduced into the ICU, 2.3% needed industrial respiratory support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of those who were hospitalized because of Kovid-19 eventually enter the ICU.
Industrial breathing becomes more complex with the development of ARDS in the covide-19 population and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
The respiratory systems need to have high positive pressure control and end-pressure conditions to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respiratory system and the chest recovery.
High positive end-pressure may not be available in old respiratory systems.
The search for possible treatments began in January 2020, and many antiretroviral drugs are in the clinical phase.
It looks like Reddsevere is the most promising.
Although new medicines may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Anti-virus drugs can be tested for those in critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that volunteers participate in the experiences of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Medicine Department has granted temporary authorization to use the recovery plasma as a test treatment in cases where a person & apos; s life is seriously or directly threatened.
He has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to prove that he is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to enter name and identity number.
The application is able to detect 'mixed' using control data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the case of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Large data analyses are used for mobile phone data, facial identification technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence in tracking people who are infected and mixed with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government enabled the security services to track cell phone data for those presumed to be infected with the Corona virus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantine and to protect those who are likely to confuse injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data on the telephone sites collected with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Mr. Julio Gallera, stated that mobile phone companies had informed him that "40% of people were still moving everywhere."
The German Government conducted Hacathon for 48 hours on the weekend with more than 4,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Kalulide, also made a global invitation to offer innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the Corona virus.
Individuals may feel distress because of quarantine, travel restrictions, or the side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
BBC published a statement to Rory O'Connor that "increased social isolation, unity, health concern, tension and economic stagnation are a great storm that is detrimental to people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a light cycle with minor or no symptoms, as it is similar to other common diseases of the upper respiratory system such as the cold.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to be severely infected with Kovid-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as Saris and Meris, but there is still a lack of data for Kovid-19. Covid-19 may affect the lungs in some people because of pneumonia.
Covid-19 of the most rapidly affected may develop into ARS, leading to respiratory failure, a corrosive shock or a multi-organ failure.
The complications associated with Kovid-19 are instantaneous, abnormal blood clot, heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of the Kovid-19 patients who were taken to the hospital were diagnosed with blood-clotting anomalies, specifically an increase in the time of prothrombien, while 4% of them had kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of the people with Kovid-19 showed an increase in liver enzyme levels (ammonium tankers).
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five days were in hospital.
However, the average period for those transferred to the ICU between hospital entry and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average period from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and at the overall level of cases from six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The post-mortem anatomy of the lung samples shows a high-fibromoxic diaphraxis in both lungs.
Changes in viral cellular morbidity were observed in the cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage was observed due to high levels of turbonin or cardiac stroke in 11.8% of the deaths declared by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those who had been hospitalized had previously been in sick condition. The availability of medical resources and the region & apos; s socio-economic situation could also affect deaths.
The estimates of deaths due to the situation are different as a result of those differences between regions, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-counting of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of the mortality rate than the truth.
However, the fact that previous deaths have been caused may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the fact.
Smokers are 1.4 times more vulnerable to severe Kovid-19 symptoms, more in need of focused care and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20% reduction in lung capacity to 30% in some of the patients, and lung tests indicated damage.
It could also cause post-ICU syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not the previous infection would gain effective and long-term immunity from the disease.
Access is seen as a potential, based on the behaviour of other Corona viruses, but it has been announced that there have been cases of recovery from Kovid-19 and subsequently further injury.
It is believed that these cases are more aggravated if the infection continues than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the prevalence of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the prevalence of the infection was largely a result of its human-to-human transition.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of Kovid-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date of the symptoms.
According to official WHO publications, December 8, 2019 is the first date of symptoms.
Many actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options, the time taken since the onset of the disease and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO), in its 10 review of the International Classification of Diseases (ISIC), allocated the emergency code U 07.1 deaths of the confirmed SARS-2 infection and the code U 07.2 deaths of Covid-19 diagnosed as having been infected by the KV-2 virus to a clinical or epidemic without confirming HIV infection as a factor. The rate of deaths is divided by the number of deaths in a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822 / 2240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have been detected and died from a disease, and the rate of infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have been infected (those who have been discovered and those who have not been identified) and those who have died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they also follow a specific population from injury to finding out the fate of the situation.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all injured, their presence may provide information on the number of injured.
At the centre of the outbreak of the disease in Italy, Castilyoni de Ada, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Ganglet, the disease was spread because of carnival festivals and moved to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all of the deaths of Kovid-19 were officially classified as their result.
Moreover, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe I have about 3% antibodies, according to an assessment made on blood donors.
The death of 69 (0.004% of the population) was confirmed by Kovid-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women at the age of 90 only.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a cause.
The gender-sensitive differences, the non-prevalence of smoking among women and the simultaneous morbidity of men, such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women, may have contributed to the high mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of the injured were men and 72% of the men who died because of Kovid-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government does not follow the sex-disaggregated data for the Kovid-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and tuberculosis affect men and women differently.
The highest proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have increased the risk of HIV infection.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official name of the disease as "Covid-19."
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Gepresus, explained that Ko is a short word for Corona, and in a short for a virus and a short for a disease and 19 refers to the year of discovery for the first time: 31 December 2019.
The name has been selected to avoid a reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in line with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes Kovid-19 is called the Corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cove-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the terms "covide-19" and "covide-19" in public data.
The disease and the virus are usually referred to as the Corona virus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were usually referred to as "Corona virus" and "Corona and Han virus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the names of the new Corona virus-2019 and the acute respiratory disease associated with the new Corona-2019 virus as temporary names of the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidance prohibiting the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names of Kovid-19 and Saris Cove-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Given the limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies issue health-care materials such as nose scans and respiratory parts.
One example is, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a breathing valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on time, a local emerging company reversed its structure and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of Kovid-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged with regard to the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly on the Internet.
It seems that humans are able to transport the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus growing in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines for the treatment of the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for Kovid-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the "Solidarity Experience" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing, more effective and promising anti-virus vehicles.
No vaccine is available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS Cove are used because it looks like SARS Cove-2 in the use of ACI2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, researchers aim to create a full vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at raising an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection in Kovid-19.
The second strategy, the microunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the virus's microunits.
In the case of SARS Cove-2, this research focuses on the protein Spike S that helps the virus break into the future of ACI2 enzyme.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create a vaccine).
The experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical vaccine test started on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-harmful genetic code that is copied from the disease-causing virus. The anatomy based on the antibody has been referred to as a potential challenge to the innovation of the SARS-Cove-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical experiments under way from April 2020.
Seven already approved malaria treatment experiments were conducted, of which four were on hydroxic chloroken or chloroquin.
The most Chinese research is proposed for re-use in the treatment of the new disease, through nine phase III experiments on Reddsevere across several States, the results of which are scheduled to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and possible Kovid-19 properties was conducted as of April 20. Many of the existing anti-viral properties are being assessed for the treatment of Covid-19, including the remedesivere, chlorophene, hydroxi-chloroken, Lubinavir / Ritonavir and Lupinavir / Tonafir, which are integrated with the interveron-beta.
There is preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Reddsevere, as of March 2020.
A clinical improvement has been observed among patients treated with the Rimdecepher for compassionate use.
The clinical tests for phase III are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquin, formerly used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorophene.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research notes that although a single-gram dose is recommended, the vulnerability of this dose is extremely serious and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Medicine Department issued an emergency licence for the use of chloroquin and chloroquin hydroxi according to the estimate of doctors treating those suffering from Covide-19. The 7 Chinese guidelines also include the Enterpheron, Reapaviren or Umevenovere for use in the treatment of Covide-19.
Preliminary data indicate that the high doses of Ripaferin are necessary to discourage Saris Cove-2 in the laboratory.
It was recommended that further study be carried out of the impact of Nitazuksanid on living organisms after proving its disincentive to the low concentration of Lars Cove-2. Studies showed that the initial preparation of the Spic protein through the TMCS-2 transponder protoise is necessary for the entry of Sars Cove-2 through interaction with the future of ACI2.
The studies of chlorophene and hydroxi-chloroquin with or without Azythromysin have significant shortcomings that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study that do not discourage Oseltamifer Saris Kov-2 in the laboratory and that does not have a known role in the Kovid-19 treatment.
The cytocin storm may be one of the complications in the late stages of the sharp Kovid-19.
There is evidence that Chlordecone hydroxi may have anti-cytocin characteristics. The China National Health Commission (CNH) has added to the treatment guidelines after a small study has been completed.
The non-random phase 2 test is being tested at the national level in Italy after having shown positive results for those with severe illness.
In addition to being used in the blood serum test to determine the symptoms of cytocin, it is intended to address such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some of the infected.
The Department of Food and Drug against Interlocine-6 receptors adopted the treatment of the tate cells receiving the Khmer Reactor, based on the case studies of the recovery of the treatment of cytocin for non-steroids, which had a different cause in 2017.
So far, there is no constable evidence to live that Tuselizomb is an effective treatment for the cytocin-discharge syndrome.
The method of transport of selected and concentrated antibodies produced by the recovery immune devices from Kovid-19 to those in need is subject to study as a non-vaccine method for negative vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
The neutralization of HIV is the expected mechanism of action through which negative treatment of antibodies can act as a defence intermediary against SARS Cove-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular toxicity dependent on or both antibodies, may be used.
Other forms of negative treatment of antibodies, such as the use of single-form antibodies, are under development.
The production of the vector serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of the recovered patients and contains antibodies of the virus, can be increased to spread it more quickly.
Corona virus diseases, a very relevant group of syndrome.
Lee Win Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently injured and died because of Kovid-19 after raising attention to the spread of the virus.
