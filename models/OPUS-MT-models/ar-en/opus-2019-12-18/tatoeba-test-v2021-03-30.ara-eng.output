Tom often exceeds the speed limit by driving slightly.
I'm doing this for him.
I guarantee you this information is correct.
Bazaf!
None of this happened.
Sami was waiting in the attic.
Sami gave his card to Layla.
Arabic isn't complicated.
Can you recommend a good restaurant?
Put the gun on the table.
Give it back when it's done.
I almost forgot where I am.
Sami brought a friend.
Sami looks like you.
Sami still likes Layla.
That doesn't seem fair at all.
We like the same music.
The school spirit is seven o'clock.
Uh-huh, I left, and Shawt passed, and Blye forgot Sackad, Diyala V. Darhom.
This is an abolition
So, I'm gonna have to meet here.
Who do you think you are?
Don't look back.
School starts at 8:30.
Where'd you get the money?
I'm a man of the night.
Sami's doctor's lesson.
My mom got married again.
Maybe Tom should stop before he hurts himself.
My mom made me a bag.
Yeah, that was amazing. Unbelievable.
Wow!
He tried to write a short story.
He insisted on the importance of peace.
Don't move.
Wait a minute.
Walk to school.
Allahu Akbar!
Layla was only living her life.
It's a good deal.
I really want to see you today.
"I understand Italian wonderfully," she bragged while choosing a dish from the menu, but when the food was served, it was the same as she didn't expect.
Let's go to the theater early so we can find some good seats.
My aunt's older than my mother.
The problem is they don't have any money.
I don't have time to finish my homework.
If it wasn't for her help, I wouldn't be alive right now.
You're wrong. That's not the case.
Sami started spending a lot of time with Layla.
I can't do that.
We agreed to distribute the house-cleaning tasks amongst ourselves.
Sami is a college boy in love with parties.
We're wearing uniforms at our school.
Sami got a call from Fred's daughter.
His memory is crushing me.
I have a message for you.
Did you get to convince Fadil?
I'm talking about him.
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.
She's the Axl I know.
Can I go with him?
Go ahead.
Layla was teaching Sunday school.
Sami gave more medicine to Layla.
She loves Tom.
The town grew into a city.
My mother worked hard to raise us.
I've been silent for a long time.
Here's your house.
She committed suicide.
Hatoyama mentioned that he was supporting his family by betting on the horse race.
We have to protect the reputation of this clinic.
Sami was an impressive person.
I do some light exercises every morning.
There's no doubt Tom's having fun.
She was so salty with me.
No swimming.
Sami's office had a couch.
It sounded crazy.
Sami sat in front of Layla.
Sami returned to Egypt.
It's hard for me as a doctor to say this about another doctor, but that's the truth.
The elephant has a long nose.
Sami got upset.
Sami hit Layla and knocked her out.
All the teachers were here.
That's her shoes.
When the wind blows, the candle goes out.
Sami made a decision and no one can force him to come down.
He's a forger.
Don't you remember him?
Tom's waiting for a response.
Sunshine covered the hills.
Sami was at risk of a life sentence.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my Amazigh dictionary.
Tom's not singing anymore.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Fadil joined a government university in Philadelphia.
We have no choice but to pursue.
Would you suggest a good place to eat Korean food?
I saw you cooking.
That factory produces toys.
Elevate Edo.
Sit on the table.
I'll save you all.
I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't my teacher.
Tom runs too fast.
I'm from Australia.
We know the sun is bigger than Earth.
Today I don't feel so good.
Actually, that's why I'm here.
Thanks for coming.
Go help your brother!
She didn't come because her boyfriend didn't come.
I'm just laughing.
How am I gonna repay my debts now?
He lit Ken wax.
I want the book for me.
We finally got to the lake.
Sami is the director of the clinic.
Sami knows about it.
Layla went to college.
He's gay.
I like to eat melons.
I had a paranoid teacher.
Tom couldn't stop his tears.
May I help you?
Everybody's confused.
Jim's learning to drive.
What a beautiful child.
Fifty-two percent of British women prefer chocolate over sex.
I can jump.
Are those your dogs?
The crew is the worst bird enemy in New Zealand.
The rest is on you!
Tom was alone in the house.
Lesson one's easy.
He was hit by a pen.
Sami was taking the dog out for a walk.
For Branni, let me be puzzled.
Fadil lived on Sadiq Street.
Tom's car?
Most of the papers fell.
The hospital was opened last month.
Sami had a bug under his clothes.
Sami's past turned on him.
I have your journal.
Fadil ran the doorknob quietly and entered the house.
Sami shook that tree.
They're talking about this and that.
I have an Italian neighbor.
Sami went on vacation.
Say hello to your chastity.
I'll shoot him.
Where was Tom born?
Israel knows what it's gonna do to the West Bank, but it doesn't seem like it knows what it's gonna do with a puzzle.
She's holding something.
Go to school with the bus.
Don't work.
Sami wanted to make Layla love him.
The book is here.
Sami came closer.
"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
The Japanese like to travel as groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I see what you mean.
We're just talking.
Let's take a look.
You're in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue jacket.
The police collected a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter where it came from.
What do you think you're doing?
You got me?
It's because of me.
Tom likes to go out.
Sami's fate is in the hands of the jury.
Nancy looked purely tired.
You could waste ten dialects.
Only 15 minutes.
This is the window he broke.
Little Tom with a pond barbecue on Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What major did you study in college?
Don't say anything before you think about it.
No one believed his story.
He was run over by a car.
The Crescent and the Star are symbols of Islam.
Mary ran.
He complains all the time.
I like the room overlooking the valley.
Where's the nearest art gallery?
Tom and Mary play tennis.
Fadil believes in the Lord of Islam.
Sami's life was in danger.
Sami rented a room at the hotel.
Mom, you don't have time for an MPG!
Dima sighs and says, "I understand, I'm sorry for the mess, so enjoy the Fanta, and have a good day."
Let's share the expenses.
I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sami's car crashed into a bus parking parachute.
I have a cat and a dog.
Layla will be brought to justice.
As in heaven, so on earth.
Eder is my favorite Amazigh singer.
Did the cat eat your tongue?
I yelled at the teacher.
See you later.
What does "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.
I asked the shopkeeper, "But don't you think she's a little old?"
Why are you being so rude?
Layla abandoned Sami.
I only have half his books.
Sami was in the next room.
You're dating a kerosene student, aren't you?
He looks pretty good.
T ' aram zemre ' ad tt-ge ' .
Can you go swimming naked?
Sami was circumcised at the age of six.
Mama cut the cake.
Sami invited God to help him.
I have a good job now.
Is anyone looking?
Thank you very much, Doctor.
I have to tell Jamal what I heard.
I have no excuse.
She's getting rich.
I'll try my best not to bother you while you're studying.
You have to go back.
And tell the truth of your Lord, whoever he will, to believe and who he will, to forgive.
Sami disrespected Layla.
Fadil knew the police could make it any minute.
Where's the British embassy?
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
Does this dog bite?
Fadilla Club, Danya.
Sami was serving a sentence of life imprisonment.
She put the magazine on the table.
Sami called Layla, asking her to come and pick him up.
Sami never feels good.
Sami offered the police to tell them everything he knew.
How far away is the park from your house?
This is my house.
Thank you for the information.
Let's get ready to go.
Sami looked down.
Layla outdone Sami with intelligence.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
Did you see that, Jamal?
I use Twitter.
Give me your credentials, please.
He brought food to his guest and gave him shelter.
Is he American?
Sami made friends with his roommate.
How long does it take to get to the station?
I asked him if he was happy.
Go back to your places.
What's your favorite TV show?
The opera starts at 7:00.
Beauty is not a saint.
I've never climbed Mount Fuji.
Please, be quiet.

Fadil was crossing the road.
Sami wrote Layla a lot of letters.
Tedipandy Ala you've been tucked in.
Sami needs rest.
Tom's losing a lot of blood.
It could take a while.
I remember seeing her once on the road.
Mennad knows.
They're gay.
When did the meeting end?
The intense fog made it hard to see the way.
Take your time, Yoshida.
What's the matter with her?
She told me what tossinish.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Layla.
I'd better ask her.
Mariko speaks English with skill.
I don't care what others say.
Tom didn't want to dance with Mary.
What about you?
This isn't a white candle.
Yesterday was my birthday.
She talks like she knows everything about him.
Sami was an ambulance operator.
Sami killed a whore.
She likes oranges.
Dive in and your predatory fish will eat you.
Why is the sky blue?
I'm late for traffic.
She accused me of lying.
Who's supposed to receive West Bank and Gaza Palestinians if they're fired?
I'm taking you home.
Fadil expressed his grief.
I looked around.
Sami's life has changed forever.
It's too big.
Fadil is Arab.
Her eyes are blue.
We're celebrating Layla's pregnancy.
We won the game.
The police continued to search Fadil's vehicle.
Come forward.
Does Toshio Satchiko like?
I fixed the bike yesterday.
Sami's out of danger.
Give it back!
Tom, italian kryon.
Israel is not the Jewish people, let alone the Jewish religion.
As soon as their meeting is over, they start working.
I'm happy with my life.
I know what you're trying to do.
Do you speak Turkish?
Tom scarred on his face.
Fadil fell in love with an Egyptian woman.
Do you like running?
Sami came to us and greeted us.
We have to ask for Tom's permission.
Fadil began to care about Arabic.
Dima asked, "What do you mean?" But he burped, because if he stayed silent, that sentence would be very simple.
I tried to get Charles to help me, but he didn't.
Sami was having fun.
Use every chance.
Sami made his whole double life.
We ate a whole shipment of apples.
Grass needs to be scrubbing.
Show me how it works.
Anyway, that's not a big deal.
Can I ask, where are you going?
It's Tom's turtle. It's Mary's name.
I hope summer never ends.
Sami wanted Layla to give him more money.
You know what English is?
Sami has no right to do this.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of her car.
Sami was tied to the hospital bed.
I'm glad to hear your voice.
Layla joined a camp for neo-Nazis.
Open the door.
Sami was a resident at a local hospital.
Poor flower.
He's just a man.
I'll stay with you forever.
Tom's dead.
Sami asked Layla if he could borrow more.
I owe it to them to succeed in helping me.
You talk too much.
They got separated.
I usually go to school Monday to Friday.
Jim hit her piano.
I just finished my job.
I'm tired of taking his own pride.
What kind of Japanese food do you like?
They must resolve disputes between States.
I want a cup of coffee.
The student came from London.
Hey, get off my bike.
Fadil didn't hear from Layla.
He was an alternate teacher.
Sami slapped Layla again.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Sami waited six weeks.
Sami's YouTube videos were deleted.
This game seems kind of dangerous.
I'm getting colder.
Good always wins.
Nancy smiled happily.
Tom responded to the call.
All the bananas you brought to me yesterday were rotten.
Sami and Layla had sex partners.
I want to buy.
I went to the wrong address.
I don't have more than 1,000 yen.
Are you drinking?
With cat grace, he jumped to the shelf but failed and fell to the ground.
Fadil was never there.
Fadil's mother described her son as a good boy.
Is it too expensive?
"Where were you?" "I was in a meeting at a beach meeting with Sammy?"
I want to be a firefighter.
Sami continued to send messages to Layla.
Are you free tomorrow?
I don't blame you for hitting him.
No one understands what's going on.
He's running.
I came.
Sami was thinking about his life.
I'll sue you.
Excuse me, would you repeat that?
We enjoyed swimming in the river.
Tom reads the Bible.
Music is a universal language.
What's your favorite TV show?
Go ahead. You're 30.
Grandpa from Osaka.
It's cold.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Hairfall at that age was sad for her.
Maybe you know where my books are.
There are things I have to do at home.
You look like you did something you had to do.
But I don't want to run away, I want to see Italy.
I've been looking forward to this all week.
You can always sleep on my couch.
School starts at the clock hoping for a script.
Layla cooked dinner for Fadil.
She slept at 10:00 yesterday.
Maybe. You'd prefer a French dish.
What are you waiting for?
The car's coming from the right.
Stress can have a significant negative impact on your health.
Why would we want to do that?
Don't despise a human being because he's poor.
Sami loved life.
What exactly are you looking at?
I love hearing music with you.
Keep walking for a while.
Sami figured it out.
What would you like to eat?
Is that your sister?
Sami borrowed Layla's car.
I want to buy you a present.
Sami tried to escape justice.
Sami turned himself in to the police.
Where's the resident?
Is that your car?
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
I wasn't alone.
This idea doesn't make sense.
What's the real reason you didn't want to do this?
They went to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
Don't forget to think before you start talking.
I want you to read it.
Sami worked.
Mennad cried.
Damien Chiquiyo.
Sami was a friend of Layla's friends.
Sami's listening.
Rain has changed to snow.
I'm not going unless you tell me where to find Tom.
We've seen three wars.
Do you think he did the work alone?
I'm a Palestinian.
Don't look at her!
My son went to London, where I was born.
Everyone was happy.
Where do you play tennis?
This explanation goes beyond my capacity.
Get out of your bed!
Who's that boy?
Do you have the key to that door?
A cat came out from under the desk.
I understand your language.
You might have to fire her.
The hand has five fingers.
We can't wait for dinner.
I'm not swimming in this lake.
Not every question is worth answering.
Sami was confused.
Who stole the apple?
I'm sure it's working.
Are you talking to me?
We are facing a huge crisis.
Did Tom give you that water gun?
You're giving the matter more than it's worth.
Sami was living a strange life.
He was never happy.
Sami doesn't carry his gun with him.
This boat is seaworthy.
I used to think it was my job to help Tom.
Mary wanted to know if Tom had a girlfriend.
You're not the first to make that mistake.
Fadil's been reported missing.
It's none of your business.
She loved a younger guy.
There's no air in this room.
In that country, the government controls prices.
Look at me.
One sugar cube, please.
Everyone has the right to enjoy an international social order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration are fully realized.
Fadil received a number of letters from Layla.
We're going to a dance tomorrow.

I have to buy one.
Do you want to go to the movies?
Sami shot Layla in the head.
She doesn't like snakes and math.
Sami had no one to help him.
Learn in public school.
You should join me.
I rarely see it.
What are you doing, Dad?
Sami got a weird call from someone he didn't recognize.
I have to get up anyway.

Layla suffered from severe depression.
Take a picture.

We have good news.
Sami recorded himself.
Same thing happened to a friend of mine in a week!

Art was incredibly anti-Semitic.
There's something I want to tell you.
I went to the hospital to visit him.
Can you spend 50?
Layla put her hand on Sami's hand.
Tom repeated the same mistake.
Please write what I have to say.
My teacher hates me.
Sami was moving.
I'm not gonna let her go there.
Eventually, the dispute was resolved.
That's a joke.
The fighter jet dropped a bomb.
Are your hands clean?
Yogurt went up in a circa.
No one can beat him.
We're not dating.
She's an Arab roast.

I visited Shanghai when I last visited China.
But the story has another side.
Sami wrote Layla a long love letter.
Anything important?
I forgot my e-mail address.
He read the book from leather to leather.
Fadil left the hospital.
Our baby can walk.
Do you like tennis?
This is a tree.
Is he a friend?
Honey is made by bees.
Once that bell rang until the teacher went into class.
It's late.
I just want an honest answer, no more.
He insulted me for no reason.
He just started.
Muslims don't broadcast music in mosques.
Fadil brought Layla home.
It's a tradition.
I promised him.
Do you know what it means when a man gives a woman a ring?

You shouldn't go.
I have ten pens.
He didn't even say a word to me.
These bear puppies are still nursing.
Sami kept sending money to Layla.
Sami taught Arabic at a Christian school.

That's my cat.
How many times have you gone?
We have to do it every day.
If you're a man, act like a man.
Probably arrive soon.
I'm worried about him.
You decided to stop smoking.
You only hear those voices in your head.
Layla wanted attention.
Why did you say that?
I'm a little older than you.
Can you believe what he said?
Sami walked.
I'm not the woman Sami deserves.
Where's my watch?
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
Let him finish his sentence!
Do you need an ambulance?
Sami was seen taking pills.
We can't wait anymore.
The teacher loved me.
They were waiting for the launch signal.
I want to tell you something.
She lives in New York.
This is where he lives.
Freedom for Kurdistan!
Sami decorated the office.
What's that for?
You're driving me crazy, baby. I know.
What are you learning?
He can do this better than me.
I dipped my finger in honey.
Not science fiction.
Did you miss me?
Tom thanked me for the gift.
