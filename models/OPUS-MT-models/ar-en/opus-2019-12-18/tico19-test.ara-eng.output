The rapidly increasing cumulative number of corona virus disease (Coved-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of corona virus disease (Koved-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, which confirms that although the stage varies according to the state, the Coved-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Based on Italy ' s experience, States, hospitals and ICUs should increase their readiness to increase the number of Coved-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia were reported for unknown pathogens in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention stated that the causal factor is the new Corona virus now referred to as the Corona 2 virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-KOV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-KOV-2 has been called the Corona virus disease (Coved-19).
So far, the evidence is that almost 80% of individuals with Coved-19 suffer from a mild disease; that is, they suffer respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, Caved-19 was aggravated by a severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients who were hospitalized due to Coffid-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative number of Coved-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of Koved-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom with the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Coffid-19 cases in EU/EEZ States and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, Koved-19 has increasingly spread geographically and is following the dynamics of the Coveed-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coffid 19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of March 5, 2020, Speeteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of European Coffid 19 according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 of persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, Coved-19 cases have been detected in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (U.K.), as between December 31, 2019 to date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and cumulative rate of Coffid-19 cases obtained
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported cases of Coved-19 in every country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of Coffid-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and compared with those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of Coved-19's active cases, we calculated the cumulative number of sporadic Coved-19 cases within 14 days, thus taking into account the natural course of Coved-19, in all EU/EEZ countries and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of cases reported by each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Coved-19 trends in EU/EEZ and UK
Trends in the cumulative number of Koved-19 cases taken over a 14-day period were followed in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEZ) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Hubbi Province) (Figure 1).
For the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of Coved-19 began to increase on approximately 21 February, and increased sharply on 28 February 2020 (approximately supplementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all EU/EEZ States and the United Kingdom showed trends of increase similar to the cumulative number of Coffid-19 (Supplementary).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of Coffid-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of March 15, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEZ States and the United Kingdom reported the total number of cases actually similar to that in Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of Koffid-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative number of Coved-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar pace in all States.
In spite of the fact that States are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the fact that the definition of the situation in different States and protocols may differ to select patients who must be tested for Coved-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where approximately 10% of Coved-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission to hospitals and/or the EC/EE intensive care units are currently available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, they need to be collected in a systematic manner to update current observation data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive and middle care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive care and middle care per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios associated with the saturation of health care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of Coffid-19 cases that have entered hospital associated with the risk of > 90% excess of the capacity of the ICU beds, are available in the sixth update of the Coved-19 rapid risk assessment of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since the cases collected so far in certain regions of the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom, and the hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide information on the cases and focus care beds at the level of the designation of regional statistical units 2 (NTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the Coffid-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, States, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of a sustainable community transition of SARS-KOV-2 and an increase in the number of Coved-19 patients in need of health care, particularly intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay SARS-Kov-2 deployment with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not allow decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand and accept and adjust their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity during which countries can increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-Koff-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, health-care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the Corona 2019 virus (Coved-19), caused by the SARS-2 virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), resulted in the death of more than 3,000 people and the injury of more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-KOV-2, similar to SARS-KOV, which caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, Koved-19 has a lower risk and death rate than Sars but is more mobile and influential among older persons than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving subject of research.
We will address the basics of the disease ' s epidemiology, causes, viral science, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
On January 25, 2020, the Spring Festival became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory of all Chinese who were urged to stay inside their homes throughout the holiday period and for many weeks thereafter because of an outbreak of an emerging viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the Corona (Kov) virus, which caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it Saris-Koff-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was called Cove-19 (Koved-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of cavity 19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that Caved-19 is the "public enemy number one" and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research papers were published on Koffid-19, which included his own viral science, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated by many patients.
The purpose of this review is to summarize research progress in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare Coffid 19 to Sars and another Cove-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Merce, a 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far with regard to disease prevention and forecasting, as well as some urgent questions that remain.
Corona viruses are usually considered to be non-lethal in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the 4 common colds.
Nevertheless, in this century we have faced two severe human disease-causing viruses, Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, which originally caused an outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries at an alarming rate of prevalence and death.
Therefore, the current Coffid-19 is a third outbreak of the Corona virus in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, groups with unknown pneumonia originating from Wuhan were first reported to the Chinese National Health Committee on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the Corona virus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infections were reported among health-care providers, indicating that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed down with all public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was identified as the starting site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
As the situation rapidly evolves, the final scope and gravity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed patients with Coved-19, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-KOV-2 injured persons of all age groups, but mainly between 30 and 65.
Nearly half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-KOV-2 hit a larger number of men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100.000).
Coffid 19 expanded between groups mainly in and around Hopi.
Coffid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the infection to the diagnosis.
The average period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of injury from the beginning to the death was 9.5 days (4.8.13 days).
The basic reproduction figure (the basic reproduction number) was 3.77 (the range of confidence is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the basic reproduction figure adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of injured increased dramatically before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travels before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality ratio among confirmed patients was 1.44% (the confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality ratio for all patients was 3.06% (the confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for Coved-19 were gender (male), age (age) and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a species of large and wrapped viruses that contain a single-chain DNA genome positive direction.
It can be divided into four races, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and it's known that the Corona viruses of alpha and beta are infected with humans.
The coated fork (S) of the diabetes protein is associated with its cellular receptors, i.e., enzyme transgenic 2 (ACE 2) and dibutedyl dibutadial 4 (DPP 4) for Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, respectively, and then the membrane merges.
The viral DNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic DNA, accompanied by the sugar-cover proteins and the mitral cauldron proteins, is a verion-containing nuclei, and is combined with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genome sequence of Sars-Koff-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-KOV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-Koff with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among the 10 sample sequences collected from the original outbreak site, Hwanan Seafood Market Bohan.
SARS-KOV-2 looks more genetically like SARS-KOV than MERS-KOV.
The electronic microscopic examination of the transport revealed that SARS-KOV-2 is in very thin sections of the human airway back.
It has been revealed that the human enzyme transforming angiotencin 2 is the future of Sars-Koff-2 as well as Sars-Koff.
However, the S-S-S-S-Coff-2 protein is associated with the human enzyme transformer of angiotencin 2 with a weaker connection than SARS-Coff, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-Coff-2 causes less acute infection in patients than SARS-Coff.
SARS-KOV-2 can also form a short, new protein coded by orf3b and a sorted protein coded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-KOV-2 may play a role in viral pathological capability and limit the expression INN. However, it does not contain orf8 in any known range or pattern.
On February 18, 2020, Cho et al. reported the structure of the full length of the human enzyme transgenic 2 under the super-cold electron microscope at 2.9 Å within a compound with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a Demer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could link a protein S, providing evidence of the recognition of the Corona virus and infection.
A sodium-based neutral amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for testing drugs to suppress infection with SARS-KOV-2.
Original Host and Intermediate Host
It has been defined that both Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff have emerged from the bats and have been transferred to humans through the rugby and camel cats, respectively.
By comparing Sars-Koff-2's cellular evolution with other Corona viruses, the original host of Sars-Koff-2, where the new virus corresponds to 96% of the Corona virus, is similar to a bat-SL-CoVZX45 and a bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Nevertheless, the intermediary host who helped the virus cross the inter-factional barrier to humans remains unknown and has not yet clarified the course of the transition.
G and others suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a similar remodelling within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that ants, which are long tongue ants mostly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediaries for Sars-Koff-2 based on a 99% genetic symmetry in the Corona virus detected in ants' ants and in Sars-Koff-2.
However, the difference of 1% spread across genomes remains significant; hence, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (figure 33).
Sars-Koff-2 ' s physico-chemical properties are still largely unknown.
SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment up to 5 days at temperatures below 20°C and humidity ranging from 40% to 50%.
SARS-KOV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-KOV-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75% concentration, chlorinated disinfectants, Proxy-Astek acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents could effectively discourage the virus.
The entire human race is generally immune to SARS-Koff-2, and therefore more vulnerable to HIV infection.
Currently, no detailed study on SARS-KOV-2 immune response has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other Corona viruses, in particular Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff (figure 4) 4.
In general, after an invasion of a host virus, the natural immune system recognizes it through patterns recognition receptors (PRRS), including type C receptors similar to the linen, a similar future to TLR, a receptor similar to the range of NLR coupons, and a similar future to the RIG-I protein (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammative agents, the maturity of diving cells, and the installation of I (IFN) interferones that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large opaque cells of viral antigens.
However, protein N in SARS-Koff can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in defence.
The TC4+ cells stimulate the BCs to produce antibodies dedicated to the virus, and the TC8+ cells kill those directly infected with the virus.
T-cells produce cytokines activated for inflammation to help the trigger cells.
However, the Corona virus can reduce the functions of the T-cells by inducing programmed death of the T-cells.
Mixed immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also necessary in the fight against viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies have been neutralized by a healthy Myrs-Koff patient.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free roots that can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs and, at worst, a failure of multiple organ functions and death.
Sars-Koff-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is likely to affect older persons with multiple illnesses and pregnant women more often.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune jobs are affected to have a greater chance of infection than others.
The estimated average duration of Sars-Koff-2 custody is 1.14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the period of custody averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As explained above, a more recent study showed that the period of custody was 4.8 (3.0.7.2) days based on a demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is of the utmost importance that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the strictest period of custody, thus preventing infected persons from transmitting the virus to others without symptoms.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with HIV are usually required to undergo quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often the primary and primary display of Coved-19, and can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat infection, nausea, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from respiratory distress and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In extreme cases, patients developed rapidly to suffer acute respiratory syndrome, stun shock, metabolic acid, and congenital morbidity.
Patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and severe fever must be examined, even without being subjected to pulmonary abnormalities, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% respiratory distress, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that has been infected by a person who has not shown symptoms.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that Merce-Coff patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
Nevertheless, 80% of them needed much more breathing support than Koved 19 patients and were consistent with the rate of maternity of the highest Merce of Coved 19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat infection (21%) were also observed in Merce patients.
In Sars patients, both fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat infection (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support had to be provided to about 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate from Koffid was 2%, while confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
In comparison, by November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of the 8.996 confirmed cases.
For Merce, the mortality rate was 37% of confirmed cases of 2,494, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
According to a previous study, the basic reproduction figure of SARS-KOV-2 was as high as 6.47 in the CA confidence range 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while the basic reproduction figure of SARS-KOV ranged from only 2 to 4.
A comparison between SARS-KOV-2, MirS-KOV and SARS-KOV in terms of their symptoms, mortality and basic reproduction figure is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-KOV-2 has greater proliferation potential than Mers-Koff and SARS-KOV, but less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, the SARS-KOV-2 epidemic is far more difficult to control than the Mers-Koff and SARS-KOV epidemics.
The onset of the disease occurs mostly in the family itself or from the group itself or the vehicle itself, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travelling to and staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of engaging with persons or patients during the last two weeks before the disease appears.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have come out of hospitals can again carry the virus, sending a warning to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a natural or low number of OB cells (especially lymph cells) at the early stage.
For example, lymphoma was detected with the number of white blood cells < 4x109/L, including the number of lymph cells < 1x109/L, high levels of the Aspartate and Blood Breathers carrier in 1,099 patients with Coved-19.
Levels of liver, muscle and muglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients have increased, and the reactionary protein C has increased and the blood burden of most patients has increased.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of Demer D has increased, resulting from the blood fracture of vibrin, and the number of lymph cells has gradually decreased.
The disorders in X-rays are found in most of Coved-19 patients and are characterized by double graft shadows or glass blackened in the lungs.
Patients sometimes suffer from non-stereotypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and elevated fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The functional dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 pulmonary cells reduces the level of surface activation and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, it often compares the worst results of chest X-rays and the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, Coved-19 ' s first pathological analysis showed pulmonary cell pulmonary peeling, helini membrane, cell lymphoma, and multinucleic cell cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with viral infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to those of patients with SARS and Merce.
The discovery of SARS-Koff-2's replicative DNA through the reaction of PTT-BCR was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of Koved-19.
However, because of the high rate of false negative consequences, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which no longer depend individually on RTTCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
There was also a similar situation in SARS' diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical appearances, laboratory tests and radiation imaging discoveries is essential and essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol for the use of the Crisper-based Sherlock technique for SARS-Coff-2, which detects parts of SARS-Coff-2 ' s DNA at a rate of 20 x 10-18 Molly/L to 200 x 10-18 Molly/L (10-100 copies per microlater input) using dives in less than an hour without the need for precision devices.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if it is verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new Corona virus, doctors can provide mainly supportive care for Coved-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments previously used or proposed to treat other Corona viruses, such as Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These include current and potential antiviral treatments, immunocaptures, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested for use for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antivirus vaccines.
Sars-Koff-2 attacks primarily the lungs at the beginning, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other enzyme-transforming organs of enzyme of the negotiator 2, such as digestive device, intestines and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorder and failure are the most serious threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to mitigating symptoms and saving lives, including general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, non-synthetic respirators, and some artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from acute respiratory symptoms must be supported by extra-body membrane (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat cardiac failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of fluid balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and stun shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for Sars-Koff-2 patients.
Storm cytokin is known to result from an excessive reaction from the immune system of Sars and Merce's patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of regular inflammatory reaction characterized by the launch of a series of cytokines, including TNF. something including IL-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free roots and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Vaccination is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Activated hormones, toxylisomap and anti-interloquin 6 anti-tunnel antibody were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immune suppression treatments for the cytokine storm include modification of the immune reaction to the T-cell; the INN-YU, IL-1 and TNF blockade; the inhibition of Janus Kinaz; Plinatumap; the cytokin signal cytokin 4; and the Heston Decetellis inhibitors.
Symptoms and immunosuppressants have been used extensively in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at greater doses were not useful with severe lung injury in Sars and Coved-19.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially subaerobic osteoporosis, which has a severe impact on the prediction of the disease.
Nevertheless, it was recommended that short cycles of small- to medium-dose hormones be used with caution for the critical cases of Coved-19 patients.
At the time of writing, the effectiveness of any antiretroviral therapy has not been confirmed.
Nevertheless, it has been discovered that giving Reddissevere, the counterpart of New Cletidi, was effective with a patient of 19 American Coved.
Reddissevere is a novel antivirus developed initially by Gilliad to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Reddissevere also demonstrated a potential disincentive for other viruses with single-chain rebuzi DNA, including the Merce and SARS viruses.
Based on these viruses, the compound Gilliad provided China with some tests on individuals infected with SARS-KOV-2, and the results are very much awaited.
In addition, Parisiteb, Interferon-Alfa, Lupinavir/Ritonavir and Rebaverin were proposed as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other post-PV/RT reflexes can occur.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients has to be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and the generation of antibodies.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease is designed to treat other patients suffering from the disease itself or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease in a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an AJ produced by BPVs to combat pathogens and other alien objects, and they identify and neutralize directly the unique molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from Kaufid-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, combined with reduced infection and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to introduce this method for widespread use before specific remedies can be found.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects need to be carefully taken into account.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune reaction and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxic.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, the isolation of biological cells from recovered patients and the identification of genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus, are more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Nevertheless, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Most of the active components remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, owing to the lack of effective and specific treatment for Coffid 19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of the Xu Feng Ji Do capsules and the Lian Hua King Win capsules was detected for the treatment of Kaved-19.
The highest recovery rates were observed in the treatment of Coved-19 patients in several provinces of China using traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of its patients, including Ganzu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hobei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of Koved-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases, must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his business partners published a study to compare Western medicine treatment (WMM) alone with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They discovered that the lengths needed to recover from the high temperature of the body, the disappearance of the symptoms, and hospitalization were much shorter in the Western Medical Group + traditional Chinese medicine than in Western Medicine only.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (ranging from mild to acute) was much lower in the Western Medical Group + Traditional Chinese Medicines as compared to the Western Medical Group only (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medical Group + Traditional Chinese Medicine as compared to the Western Medical Group only (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and integrity of traditional Chinese medicine still await more well-thought-out experiments at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to describe the procedure mechanism and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or combinations if possible.
Patients suspected of or confirmed to be infected with Coved-19 are often very scared of a highly infected and even fatal disease, and quarantined persons are bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia from activated hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported, including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Tracking mandatory mixing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the Koved-19 outbreak, can make people more concerned and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to Coved-19 patients, suspected persons and persons associated with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on SARS-Koff-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct mixing.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from animal depots and infected humans to vulnerable hosts are essential and often complementary to antiretroviral treatment in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines S to generate neutral, effective and long-range antibodies and/or preventive immunity against SARS-KOV.
Vaccinations in animal models for SARS treatment have been evaluated.
However, the effectiveness of these live-body candidate vaccines has not been determined in older persons and death-challenging models and in preventing HIV infection prior to the start of a clinical study.
Maybe it's because Sars faded 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and groups of Merce continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other areas owing to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Mears immunization strategies were developed using an inactive virus, oxygen-deficient repose DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and protein subunits, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-KOV-2 for vulnerable individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (average of 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and dynamic changes of the Corona viruses.
Coffid 19, as an intern, just started showing his entire clinical path through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.
However, according to Sars and Mers, Koffid-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in cases of severe patients.
Therefore, building a model for disease forecasting is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in resource-limited areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the patient ' s prospects for Coffid-19 (table 33):
Age: The age was the most important factor in determining the projection of Sars disease, which is also true of Coffid 19.
The 30-65 age group was mainly affected by Caved 19, with 47.7% of these patients over 50 years of age in a study of 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to be infected with underlying associated diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 to 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for Coved-19 patients.
Sex: Sars-Koff-2 hit more men than women (0.31/100.000 versus 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Symptoms and complications: Coved-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and heart failure.
Cardiac accidents were also the main cause of death in Sars patients.
It was stated that Sars-Koff-2 could also be associated with positive yellow cells with the enzyme transgenics 2, which could lead to functional liver disorders among Coved-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying illness are strongly linked and may overlap.
Non-natural laboratory results: The level of the reactionary protein C (CRP) in blood reflects severe inflammation or tissue injury, and it was suggested that it should be a predictor of disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the level of the reactionary protein C should be linked to the severity of Koffid-19 ' s disease and its prognosis.
In addition, the rise of LDH, AST, ALT and CK can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are highly visible in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're traditional signs of functional imbalances in the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: Breast X-rays and progress of clinical symptoms must be taken into account together with other problems to predict the results and complications of Koved-19.
Use of steroids: As explained above, stimulants are commonly used as an auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of infection damage.
Since the widespread use of a high dose of activated hormones in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from subaerobic osteoporosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids must be used at low dose and for a short period of time in Coved-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental Stress: As explained above, during the Koved-19 outbreak, many patients suffered exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, severe uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and sick colleagues.
It is necessary to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, Coffid-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than Sars.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory system, SARS-Koff-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory system and cause light or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other Corona viruses that cause common cold.
Thus, early or pre-school infected patients can produce a large amount of HIV during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-Kov ' s transmission was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while most of the transmissions were not at an early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of Coved-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, strenuous efforts are under way in China, including the closure of Wuhan, surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of nearly all the population in the hope of impeding the movement of Sars-Koff-2.
Although these measures have greatly affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline will continue for three to four months.
Nevertheless, some other experts do not have the same level of optimism.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that Caved 19, which seems much more contagious than Sars, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-KOV-2 could affect two thirds of the world ' s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-KOV-2 had been detected in the midway oyster and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like periodic seizure.
Nevertheless, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, indicating that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to 1 million cases with half a million deaths.
Nevertheless, the disease was ultimately controlled through strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-KOV, SARS-KOV-2 could become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathological virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the Koffid-19 epidemic is presented below (figure 55).
SARS-KOV-2 moves at a higher rate through cough or sneeze, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with HIV-contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the feces, raising a new possibility of moving from the feces to the mouth.
According to a recent study of 138 cases, 41% of cases may have resulted from hospital infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Considerable precautions are therefore needed to protect human beings, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have reached out to sick or injured persons.
The wearing of face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (chain No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical facial masks prevent liquid trains from a possible person from travelling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of materials, where they can be passed to others.
However, N95 masks (chain No. 1860s) can only protect from inhalation of small PVs of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the PV being able to fully penetrate; Sars-Koff-2 SARS-KOV is similar in size and is approximately 85 nm each.
Given that particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks that stick together, health-care providers directly mix with patients must wear N95 masks (chain No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers must wear appropriate insulation terms to reduce further communication with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a Dr. Sars-Koff-2 was injured despite wearing the N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health-care providers should also wear transparent facial protections or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more disinfected soap than usual, try to stay at home for self-sanitary quarantine and limit contact with potential individuals.
Three feet is an appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-KOV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its close similarity with SARS-KOV, as reported on January 7, 2020, would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control did not reassure the citizens that the new virus had a low infection rate and a limited human-to-human reproduction and that there was no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced public preparedness, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest scale in Wuhan.
China ' s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious when issuing public statements because every word is important to citizens and can change their behaviour and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) be more issued for targeted and effective training to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and periodically improve the response system of society.
The Coffid-19 outbreak of SARS-KOV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing these lines.
Given that the virus is very similar to SARS-Koff and the symptoms are also similar between Caved-19 and SARS, the outbreak of Keved-19 has given rise to a sense of repeated SARS infection.
Nevertheless, there are some notable differences between Caved-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
Coffid 19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of intensity and mortality is also higher among older persons than among young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than Kaved-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Coved-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of Coved-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-KOV-2 spreads so much faster and wider than SARS-KOV.
The normal DNA test for Sars-Koff-2 could be negative in some Coved-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can again become infected with the virus.
These results significantly increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on Koved-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did Sars-Koff-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic match between SARS-KOV-2 and the Corona virus similar to SARS in the bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-KOV-2 comes from the bats.
What animal was the intermediate type that transmitted the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't stop moving efficiently, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-Coff-2 is associated with the enzyme transformer of the enzyme of the envion 2, how exactly does the virus enter the airstream cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also relate to the enzyme cells transgenic 2 in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this plague last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Is it gonna be a world-wide pandemic, or is it disappearing like Sars, or is it gonna come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to seek answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at what price it may take, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to normalize our lives.
Animal assets of human corona viruses
The mutation and adaptation have led the development of corona viruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human corona viruses (human corona viruses) caused a mild disease, such as colds.
The outbreak of acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown the other face to reveal the extent to which infection with human corona viruses can be severe and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS Cove-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 brought to light the Corona viruses, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the potential to cause disease compared to his brother SARS-KOV.
The human corona virus is an animal disease of origin, so our understanding of the animal origins of the human corona virus can serve us well.
Most of Corona's human viruses come from bats where they weren't disease-causing.
The intermediate warehouse hosts of some of the human corona viruses have also been identified.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Exploring the interactions between the Corona virus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of the Corona virus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available information on the seven human Corona viruses, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
What's important is that we compare and contrast different human corona viruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the reconstruction of the genome.
The disease caused by the current Corona virus epidemic is discussed in this context 2019 (Koved-19).
In addition, successful replacement requirements for the host are also highlighted and the impact of the complications of HIV development on the severity of the disease.
Corona viruses belong to the family of corona viruses, which include a group of wrapped viruses with a single reproductive DNA chain positive direction.
These viruses contain the largest genomes among the repose DNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobases called coronary viruses by this name because they are shaped like the crown under the electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, Corona viruses contain non-segregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Nearly two thirds of the genome contains two large intersecting open-reading models (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to the multiple protein types of pp1a andpp1ab.
Multiple proteins are treated further to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), E, M and N.
Different strains of Corona viruses also code a number of extra proteins from private strains.
Based on differences in protein sequences, the Corona viruses are classified into four types (Corona Alpha virus, Corona Beta virus, Corona Gamma virus and Corona Delta virus), including the Corona Beta virus types, which cover most of the human Corona viruses and are divided into four strains (a, b, c, and d).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents operate as a genetic origin for most of the Corona Alpha and Corona Beta viruses, while birds are the main repository of Corona Gamma and Corona Delta viruses.
Over thousands of years, Corona viruses have consistently bypassed species barriers and some have emerged as serious human pathogens.
So far, seven human Corona viruses (human Corona viruses) have been known.
Among them are the Human Corona-229E virus and the Human Corona-NL63 virus, which belong to the Corona Alpha virus.
The other five Corona Beta viruses include the Human Corona virus-OC43, the Human Corona virus-HKU1, the Corona virus associated with SARS-KOV, the Corona virus associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-KOV) and SARS-KOV-2.
Human corona-229E, human corona-OC43, human corona-HKU1 and human corona-NL63 usually cause light symptoms, such as colds, diarrhoea or both.
On the contrary, SARS-Koff, Mers-Koff and the newly identified virus SARS-Kov-2 are all highly pathological, causing severe lower respiratory infection to a larger number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
Dismissed from the human corona-229E virus, the first strain of B814, from nasal excretions of cold patients in the mid-20th century.
Much of the information has since been gathered through intensive studies of the human corona-229E virus and the human corona-OC43, the symptoms of which are automatically cured.
In fact, it was generally understood that infection with the human corona virus was harmless until SARS was released.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the deadliest epidemics in our present history, with 8,000 people infected with approximate deaths of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MIRS) spread a constant epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a scattered spread to the rest of the world.
Corona ' s new human virus is 2019 (Corona ' s new human virus - 2019), renamed Sars Cove-2, the cause of the current epidemic is the Coved-19 virus, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 on March 3, 2020.
The alarm rings and the world is ready for the upcoming SARS Cove-2 pandemic.
All seven Corona human viruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human corona viruses are bats, where viruses are well adapted and not disease-induced, but show great genetic diversity.
The Koved-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The tracking of the animal origins of human corona viruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for inter-species movement.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the warehouse, intermediate host and the amplified host animal of Sars Cove 2, with important effects to prevent future repercussions.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal assets, interspecies transmission, and human Corona viruses cause disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of the human Corona virus are usually non-contusive in their natural storage hosts but become pathological after transgenic to new hosts.
We also review the assessment of the course of the human Corona virus, where the increase in its transmission is often accompanied by a reduction in the severity of the disease.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS Cove-2 outbreak.
Corona's animal viruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first sequester of the B814 HC-229E virus from nasal excretions of cold patients, various types of Corona viruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dog.
In the past decades, seven species of human corona viruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human Corona virus in chronological order (table 1) would be educational and indicative.
The first strain of the human corona-229E virus was removed from the respiratory system for patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to live in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with the human corona-229E virus suffer from common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezes, maladies, throat infection, fever, and cough in approximately 10 - 20% cases.
Later in 1967, the human corona virus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transfer was in the brains of the infant mice.
The clinical features of the human corona-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those caused by the human corona-229E virus, which is indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nose viruses.
The human corona-229E virus and the human corona-OC43 virus have spread globally, often tending to travel during the winter season in moderate climate.
In general, the time of custody of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a sense of disease for almost two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy human corona-229E has caused mild colds.
Only a small number of HIV-positive patients showed severe infection to the lower respiratory system.
SARS, also known as Atypical Pneumonia, is the first human corona virus pandemic to be well documented in human history and the trigger is SARS-Koff, the third human corona virus to be detected.
The first case of SARS was dated late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths, and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the hyper-infection vector, it has been estimated that a single case could lead to approximately two secondary cases, with a period of custody of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
Sars-Koff's symptoms begin with muscle pain, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, followed as late symptoms by difficulty in breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
The lack of lymphs, the disruption of liver function, and the rise in kenaz kryatin are common laboratory disorders for Sars.
Also observed in Sars patients is the widespread abuse of Sankhi, the proliferation of visible cells, and the increase in the number of blindness cells.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in extreme cases many organs can also be infected, including the digestive, liver and kidney system, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be particularly fatal in HIV-positive patients.
The virus was released for the first time from an open lung biopsy to a relative of the first case of infection who travelled from Gwanzo to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on the human Corona virus.
The human corona-NL63 virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was found to be common in young children, older persons and HIV patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Fistula, inflammation, fever, and cystitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human corona-NL63 virus.
Another independent study described the isolation of the virus itself from a sample of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although discovered in the Netherlands, it's worldwide.
It is estimated that the human corona-NL63 virus is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with its peak occurring during the early summer, spring and winter.
The human corona-NL63 virus is associated with sedentary laryngesis, also known as strangulation.
In the same year, the human corona-HKU1 virus was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was admitted to hospital due to pneumocococcal pneumonia and pertussis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and catapultitis, it has been reported that the human corona-HKU1 virus is associated with the exacerbation of acute asthma.
The human corona-HKU1 virus has been found to be global, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to the human corona-NL63, the human corona-229E virus and the human corona-OC43 virus.
All of these four Corona human viruses acquired from society have adapted well to humans. In general, the likelihood of them mutating into diseases with high prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence has occurred for unknown reasons, as in the rare case of the most vicious subtype of the NL63, which has recently been reported as causing severe infection to the lower respiratory system in China.
Generally speaking, when Corona viruses acquire this ability to move efficiently and keep themselves constantly within humans, they also become less harmful or less diseased.
Merce-Coff was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed cases are laboratoryly originating in the Middle East, in many European States and Tunisia cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of two close personal contacts have been reported.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, resulting in 186 confirmed injuries.
The clinical symptoms caused by Merce are similar to those caused by Sars, and are characterized by acute and aggravated pneumonia.
Unlike Sars, many of the people infected with Merce have also suffered severe kidney failure, which is characteristic of Merce from other diseases caused by the human corona virus.
More than 30% of patients suffer from infectious symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Merce-Coff one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, groups of pneumonia patients were found to be the result of SARS Cove-2 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of the lower respiratory infection caused by SARS Cove-2 to be a public health emergency of international importance as it was called Kaved-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a primary mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Province of Hopi, China, is 4.2 per cent, while outside it it is 1.2 per cent.
Sars Cove-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea also appears in some of the injured.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-KOV and SARS-KOV-2 are very similar because of the high homogeneity of 82% in the neuklotides sequence, they belong to different branches in the tree of the evolution of the strains.
Sars Cove-2 appears to be less acute but more contagious than Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff.
People who do not show symptoms have been reported infected with SARS Cove-2 and may contribute to its rapid spread throughout the world.
The comparison and variation between SARS Cove-2 and the other six Corona human viruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, the human corona viruses are similar in the period of custody and the period of time of illness.
In this regard, SARS Cove-2 follows the general direction of the other six Corona human viruses.
Second, the severity of Koffid-19's symptoms is between SARS-Koff and the four human corona viruses acquired from society (i.e. the human corona virus 229E, the human corona virus-OC43, the human corona virus-HKU1 and the human corona virus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS Cove-2 is more common in cases of human corona viruses acquired from society, such as non-specific or minor symptoms or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases with Caved-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-Koff, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS Cove-2's transmission shows interesting patterns of each of the human Corona viruses acquired from society and SARS-KOV.
On the one hand, SARS Cove-2 is at least as high as the human corona virus transmission acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be ascertained whether SARS Cove-2's transmutation is decreasing after humans are transferred, as in the case of SARS-KOV and Meres-Koff.
Finally, SARS Cove-2 can be detected in poop samples as in other human corona viruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the move of SARS Cove-2 from the oral anal road plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-KOV at least in some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS Cove-2 may show seasonal prevalence, as in the case of the human Corona viruses acquired from society.
However, the features of SARS Cove-2, including the possibility of transition, and the mechanism of disease and sustainable post-human transmission, will have an impact on the final fate of the current Koved-19 outbreak.
All four Corona human viruses acquired from society and causing minor symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human corona viruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old human corona virus epidemics.
Corona ' s acutely infected human viruses, as well as those infected with acute human diseases, have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the human corona viruses must be copied in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that confront the host's limiting factors.
From this logic, the longer the SARS Cove-2 spread and the greater the number of people infected, the greater the chance of its full adaptation to humans.
If it is well adapted, it is difficult to stop human transmission through quarantine or other anti-infection measures.
The four Corona viruses acquired from society have spread among human populations for many years, causing cold among people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal warehouse.
On the contrary, Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, the causes of extreme morbidity, have not been well adapted to humans, nor have they been able to continue to move between humans.
They need to stay in and reproduce in their animal depots and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS KOV-2 has similar features to both SARS-KOV/MERS-KOV and the four human Corona viruses acquired from society.
It's extremely contagious, like the human corona viruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes more disease than the human Corona viruses acquired from society and less than Sars-Koff or Mers-Koff.
It is not yet clear whether they will be fully adapted to humans and spread among them without the need for an intermediate animal warehouse or host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the human corona viruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, warehoused, mechanic and amplifier of the human corona viruses.
Animals play the role of the evolutionary host of the human corona virus if they harbour the virus's relevant origin and share a great similarity in the level of the neuklotides sequences.
The virus of origin is usually well adapted and not ill-founded for this host.
Similarly, the Warehouse hosts the human corona virus on a continuous and long-term basis.
Either way, the hosts are naturally infected and the natural hosts of the human corona virus or her father virus.
On the contrary, if the human corona virus enters the intermediate host recently before or near its attack on humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also act as an amplified host by allowing the virus to be temporarily copied and thus transferred to humans to expand the human transmission.
The human corona virus infection may be deadlocked if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, the human corona viruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they may settle for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
The epidemiological data later revealed that Sars' first case had a date of contact with the prey.
Psychiatric prevalence surveys then indicated that animal traders have a higher prevalence rate of SARS-Coff IgG compared to ordinary people.
For the first time, Paguma larvata and raccoon dog in the markets for the sale of live animals are identified as carrying SARS-Coff-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-Coff.
This indirectly supported the fact that no other SARS case was reported after the killing of all yogurt cats on the market.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-Koff's examination of masked palm-beds living on the wild or farm without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, indicating that masked palm-beds may only be an amplifier-amplifier host, but not the natural warehouse of SARS-KOV.
It should be noted that, since 80% of the various animals in the Guanzu markets have anti-Saris-Koff objects, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also act as an amplified intermediary host to Sars-Koff is not excluded.
Looks like all these are hosts who don't move SARS-KOV.
The subsequent search for Sars-Koff's animal natural host led to the detection of the closely associated bat corona virus, called the Chinese HKU3-related bat virus, which is found in the Chinese horse's bat.
The result of the screening of SARS-Koff antibodies in these bats and the gene sequence of the HKU3 virus was positive.
This virus and the other corona bat viruses share 88-92% of the sequences of nucleotides with SARS-KOV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Several severe acute respiratory syndrome-like corona viruses (SARS-like corona viruses) have been identified from the bats, but none could be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
The human enzyme transgenic 2 is known as the transgenic enzyme of SARS-KOV.
It has been established that WIV1 derived from a bat poop sample was using enzyme transgenic 2 in the bat, yogurt cat, and humans as receivers to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of those recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had the potential for the WIV1 equation.
So far, WIV1 is the most associated virus in bats with SARS-Coff, sharing 95% of the sequences of nucleotides.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct father virus of Sars-Koff and that the bats are not a direct repository of Sars-Koff.
Analysis of the evolution of the Mers-Koff strains is collected in the Corona-HKU4 virus group in the bats and the Koruna-HKU5 virus in the bats themselves.
The corona-HKU4 virus is used in bats and Merce-Koff is the host ' s own receiver, Bibtidel Ptedaz4 (Peptadile Peptidaz4), to enter the virus.
The polymerase DNA sequences based on Mers-Koff ' s DNA are closer in terms of the evolution of the strains to his counterparts than the Corona Beta viruses in the bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Merce-Koff lives in wild bats.
Merce-Coff and the Corona-HKU25 virus share its closest bats with only 87% of the sequences of nucleotides.
Thus, the host bats may not be the direct warehouse of Mers-Koff.
On another level, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only positive toothlet is the serum of Merce-Coff's equivalent antibodies, as well as the beauty of the Middle East in many African countries.
Merce-Coff was isolated from the single-sleeper nasal scans of the human virus, indicating that the camels act as the host of the original Merce-Coff Warehouse.
It should also be noted that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with Mires-Koff, but a massive viral spatter was observed.
The infected camels had significantly dispersed viruses not only by breathing, but also through the oral anal road, which is the main route for spreading the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions that many confirmed Merce cases have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases have logically been attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified species of animals housing Merce-Koff.
SARS Cove-2 shares the RAG13 virus in bats isolated from horse iron bats in a 96.2% meteorosis of nucleotides.
The hierarchy between SARS Koff-2 and RATG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-Koff and Mers-Koff.
This means that bats may not be the host (s) of Sars Cove-2's direct warehouse unless Corona's bat viruses are found almost identical in the future.
Sars Cove-2's intermediate host animals are supposed to be among the species of wild animals sold and killed in the Wuhan Seafood Market, to which many of the initial cases of Caved-19 were associated, indicating the possibility of an animal-to-human transition.
Several recent studies based on the methamphetamine sequence have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as Manis javanica can also host the Corona Beta viruses associated with Sars Cove-2.
The genes of this new ant-eating Corona virus and Sars Cove-2 share the same sequences of nucleotides as 85-92%.
However, they are closely associated with RTG13 with the similarity of about 90% at the level of the neocliotides sequences.
They are clustered in two sub-baskets of cove-2-like viruses in the Dynasty Development Tree, one of which is involved in a similar receptor connection area (receptor connection area) with SARS Cove-2, with 97.4% identical amino acid sequences.
In stark contrast, the areas of connection of the receptors to SARS Cove-2 to RTG13 are very different, although the sequence of the genome is completely higher.
A previous study of a sick ant eater also revealed viral organisms from lung samples, and it turns out that they are similarly associated with SARS Cove-2.
This study adopted various combination methods and manual treatment to generate a partial genome of the entire viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We can't rule out the possibility that the ant eater is one of Sars Cove-2's intermediate host animals.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the fact that ant-eating is the direct origin of SARS Cove-2 because of the different sequence between SARS Cove-2 and the Corona Beta viruses associated with SARS Cove-2 in ant-eating.
In addition, the distance between SARS Cove-2 and RATG13 is less than the distance between SARS Cove-2 and the Corona Beta viruses associated with SARS Cove-2 in the ant eater.
The evolutionary path of Sars Cove-2 in bats, ant-eating and other mammals is still under recruitment.
While the highest symmetry has been found in the areas of receptors between SARS Cove-2 and the aphrodisiac ants, the Corona Beta viruses associated with SARS Cove-2 and SARTG13 share the highest symmetry of the entire genome sequence.
Predominant speculation is that the high degree of similarity between the areas of connection of SARS Cove-2 aphrodisiacs from the Corona Beta and SARS Cove-2 viruses is driven by selective convergence.
There is a counter-proposal that is likely to reconstruct SARS Cove-2 in the animal ants of the Corona Beta virus and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
The restructuring is widespread among the Corona Beta viruses as a driving force for development.
The direct animal origin of Sars Cove-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to the highly diseased human corona viruses, the animal origin of the human corona-229E virus, the human corona virus-OC43, the human corona virus-NL63 virus and the human corona virus-HKU1 virus have also been studied.
Evidence of the evolution of strains has suggested that both the human corona virus-NL63 and the human corona virus-229E may have originated from the corona bat viruses, while the father viruses of the human corona virus-OC43 and the human corona virus-HKU1 virus were found in rodents.
It has been reported that the Corona virus in bats called ARCOV-2 (AKP) detected in tricolour bats in North America is closely related to the human corona-NL63 virus.
On the other hand, the human corona-229E virus was found to be genetically associated with another corona virus in bats, called hipposideros/ GhanaKwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, and the camels were also suspected to be their intermediate host.
To illustrate, the current information on the animal origins of the human Corona viruses known in figure 1 and table 2 has been summarized.
An analysis of the evolution of the strains has provided evidence of transgenic transmissions of human Corona viruses throughout history.
When the human corona-OC43 virus crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of human corona-229E transmission among species is still less clear.
Corona Alpha viruses in bats have been found to be relevant to the Corona human virus 229E.
There's an alpha corona virus in Alpaca.
Many evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpaca, may have contact with bats in a common environmental habitat.
While humans are in close contact with the paka.
Second, the human corona-229E virus from the corona alpha virus in bats is multiple and non-contusive in bats, while the corona alpha virus in alpaca causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha corona virus associated with the pupa has not been detected in the wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the Alpaca has been infected with the human corona-229E virus of the Corona Alpha virus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human diseases, including rabies, Ebola, Nebah and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats could transmit the human corona-229E virus directly to humans.
While the Corona Alpha virus in bats plays the role of collecting the genes of the human Corona-229E virus, the Alpaca and the lonely camels may act as intermediate hosts transporting the virus to humans, as is the case in Mers-Koff.
Merce-Coff gives an excellent example of inter-species transmission, which moves from bats to lonely camels and from lonely camels to humans.
Merce-Koff's evolutionary origin has been known from the bats since the beginning of their identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich combination of viruses to exchange genetic pieces within a species and transfer them between species.
The bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and the strong ability to fly, all of which are conditions conducive to making them an ideal "virus distributor."
On the other hand, Merce-Koff has moved to the only gourmet camels for decades.
It has been well adapted to these sentences until it has shifted from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Merce-Coff causes very little disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
His intermittent movement to humans remains a coincidence and humans are an untransmitted host for Mers-Koff, where his transition cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of Mers-Koff, the role of ant-eating, if any, in the movement of SARS Cove-2 is different.
In particular, the Corona Beta viruses associated with the aphrodisiac eaters are seriously ill.
They may be non-transmitter hosts for Sars Cove-2 from the Corona Beta virus, similar to the yogurt cat in the case of Sars-Koff.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities of SARS Cove-2 moving species to humans by either proving them or excluding them.
First of all, bats may be the host of a virus warehouse linked to Sars Cove-2, which is mostly identical to Sars Cove-2.
Humans and bats may share an environmental habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, ant-eating can be one of the intermediate amplifiers of the virus associated with the recently discovered SARS Cove-2 virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming prey meat.
It is likely that many mammals, including pets, are vulnerable to SARS Cove-2.
There's reason to do an antibody scan in pets and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, there may have been a remodelling and adaptation of Sars Cove-2 in a third type with contact with bats and ants.
The search for the animal origin of Sars Cove-2 is still under way.
Apart from the different types of animal hostess, on the viral side there are three key factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of Corona viruses to overcome species barriers.
First of all, her mutation rates are relatively high in the DNA multiplier.
The estimated mutation rates of Corona viruses, compared to other mono-chained rebuzi viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average turnover rate of ~10-4 per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the Corona virus to new hosts.
Corona enzyme rebonoclease viruses contain corrective external viruses, the elimination of which leads to extremely high convertibility and depravity or an inability to develop.
Interestingly, remedicifer is known for its ability to suppress the corona virus by inhibiting the external reponolyase enzyme and repozoic DNA polymerase.
Reddissevere is one of Sars Cove-2 ' s proselytizing agents and is scheduled to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutations of Corona viruses is about a million times higher than the rates of hostesses.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when Corona viruses are not properly adapted to the host.
The rate of mutation for Sars Cove-2 is markedly low when compared to a high mutation of Sars-Koff, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Looks like he's already adapted to another host close to the human.
In addition to SARS Cove-2, this also applies to Merce-Coff, who has adapted well to the only gossip camels.
In theory, genetic deviation is unlikely to help vaccines and antiretroviral drugs resist SARS Cove-2 by quickly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive rebuzi DNA genome in the Corona viruses is actively providing an additional donate of mutation and re-engineering, thereby increasing the probability of interspecies evolution, which would help create new corona viruses when conditions are favourable.
This is supported by the unique open reading templates and coded protein functions near the end of 3 ♪ of genome.
Third, the Corona viruses randomly and frequently replace the models during the reproduction of rebuzi DNA through the unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host it's like a blended vessel, the sequences change frequently during the repuzie DNA version of the Corona virus.
High-symmetry high-synchronous nuclear acids and secondary genomes may regenerate to generate new corona viruses.
Evidence has been found of the evolution of strains for the natural reconstruction of the human corona virus (HKU1) and the human corona virus (OC43), as well as of the animal corona virus as well as of the acute acute respiratory syndrome (SAR) virus in bats and the corona-HKU9 virus in bats.
HIV interaction with the host associated with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned earlier, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
In this regard, we are looking at the remodelling of SARS-Koff as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during inter-species transport incidents.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated samples of Sars-Koff in humans and Zabad cats, it was thought that Sars-Koff was undergoing rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations in the area of receptor connection to Protein S.
In general, the receptor field of protein S for the Corona virus interacts with the cell receiver and is heavily selected through the anti-host response.
In SARS-KOV, the area of receptor connection in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with the enzyme transgenic 2 plus the receptors assisting in the entry of the virus.
The transgenic enzyme receivers of SARS-Koff are capable of identifying the enzyme transgenic 2 assistive receivers in various animals, including bats, yogurt cats, mouse and raccoon dog, which allow for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed that were different from the viral samples of humans and yogurt cats in the receptor bonding area, and 4 of them are found in the receptor connection sequence for interaction with the enzyme transgenic receiver 2.
The K479N and S487T mutations are found in the area of SARS-KOV's receptor connection to the yogurt cat, which could increase the probability of Spike protein reaction in the human enzyme transposition receiver.
In other words, these two alternatives to amino acids may be extremely important for human viral adaptation.
It should be noted that SARS Cove-2 shares the same cellular receiver at SARS-KOV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS Cove-2 and SARS-Coff in the S1 unit of protein S, which implies that the probability of a protein S being associated with the human enzyme transformer of the negotiation 2 has changed.
Indeed, a study of the extremely cold electron microscope indicated that there is a higher probability than 10 - even 20 times that connection compared to that between the human enzyme transgenic 2 and the SV-Coff protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of assistive receiver may be required for Sars Cove-2's relocation.
It's also interesting that the human corona-NL63 virus is also associated with the enzyme transgenic 2 but in a different part of protein S.
There are many other human corona virus receivers, such as the protein analyst of the human corona-229E virus, and the accelerator sialic acid 9-O of the human corona-OC43 virus.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these Corona viruses in humans after moving between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receivers, as a result of inter-species transmission of the human corona viruses is also controlled by other reliability factors and host constraints.
The irradiation of these host proteins between humans and natural warehouse hosts of Corona viruses, such as bats, lone-cable camels and rodents, may be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human corona viruses need to control host dependencies and weaken their constraining factors to implement successful inter-species transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of HIV interaction with the host remain detectable and characterizationable.
The extensive and impartial examination of genomes can be used to examine accreditation factors and host constraints of SARS Cove-2 using the sophisticated Krysper technology.
Emerging human corona viruses: back to the starting point
The diversity of Corona viruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of emerging human Corona viruses.
And from this logic, the corona viruses in the bats are a genetic compound of the human corona viruses.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic reconstruction are also driving the evolution of the human Corona virus and are important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein encryption genes implies the ability to significantly modify viral prototypes.
Among SARS-Koff's organizational proteins, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, where SARS-Koff, associated with viruses, was isolated in bats, but found to be coded for different ORF8 proteins.
The 29 properties of the removal of the nucleotide of Saras-Koff were found to be found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the replacement of hosts.
In addition, SARS-Koff has a history of possible reconstruction through the Corona Alpha and Jama virus strains, where a large number of small remodelling areas have been identified in the RNA-based polymerase.
Refurbishment sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Mers-Koff epidemic has witnessed cases of remodelling between different strains, which occurred in the only tsunami in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, re-syncs were also observed in other human corona viruses, where human corona viruses were installed together with other animal corona viruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from the elimination of viruses from selective pressures, such as through the host immune system.
The loss of a full-length ORF4 protein in the prototype strain of the human corona-229E virus due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although ORF4 can be properly observed in the bats and camel viruses associated with the human corona-229E virus, the alpha corona virus that affects alpaca is one neuclotide stitches, leading to the mutation of the mythology framework.
Last but not least, the development of new Corona viruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Unsymptomatic or light symptoms were detected only when the bats were infected with the Corona virus, indicating the mutual adaptation of the Corona virus to the bat.
It showed that the bats adapted appropriately to Corona's viruses, both anatomy and physiologically.
For example, the low activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens caused by the Corona viruses.
In addition, natural lethal cellular activity in the bats has been suppressed due to the increased rate of the inhibited natural killer cell receiver NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main textile compatibility compound molecules I.
Furthermore, the high level of the types of reactive oxygen compounds (interactive oxygen compounds types) resulting from the high metabolic activity of the bats can lead to both the suppression of the corona virus and the effect of correction by external reponnocalase, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathological strains of the virus when a new host is infected.
Additional disease-causing strains of the Corona virus may be generated by remodelling, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three emerging human corona viruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Corona viruses do not cause disease or cause light symptoms in warehouse hosts such as bats and camels.
They clone hard without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV-positive people who do not show symptoms and the causes of acute conditions are seen in human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by overactivity of the immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung is.
In contrast, in the case of non-exposed disease carriers, the immune response is separated from the replication of the Corona virus.
A strategy similar to the separation of the immune response may have beneficial effects on SARS Cove-2.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the use of interferon type I can be used at least in the first stage of infection by SARS Cove-2 in humans.
In addition, the activation of the Kreopayrene NLRP3 in the bats is weak.
With this mental logic, the inhibition of the Kreopaine NLRP3 particle using the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in Coffid-19's treatment.
The emergence of SARS Koff-2 follows the general idea that SARS-KOV and Mers-Koff were born.
By the time it was discovered that the corona Beta virus in the bat shared a 95% neuklotide homogeneity, there was also a corona virus in the bat that shared 96% of the neuklotide homogeneity with Sars Cove-2.
While it has been discovered that yogurt cats and other animals on the market are harbouring viruses similar to Sars-Koff, they have not discovered the immediate intermediate hosts of Sars-Koff-2.
Corona Beta viruses have been detected in the aphrodisiac ants, which are very highly homogeneous with Sars Cove-2, indicating that ant-eating animals may be an intermediate host or that the beta-eating ant viruses have contributed genetic pieces, leading to the final release of Sars Cove-2.
Although questions are still being asked, there is no evidence that Sars Cove-2 is man-made, not intentionally or by chance.
Corona viruses have returned to focus because of the recent outbreak of Sars Cove-2.
The study of Corona viruses in bats and other animals has significantly changed our idea of the importance of animal origin diseases and animal depots of human corona viruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence showed that Sars-Koff, Mers-Koff and Sars-Koff-2 all originated in the bat and moved to humans through intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that Sars-Koff's infection originated from contact between humans and yogurt cats in the markets, the closure of the fresh product markets and the killing of yogurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same mental logic, ant-eating animals should be disposed of from the markets for fresh products to prevent the transmission of the disease of animal origin, in the light of the discovery of multiple genealogies of the Corona Beta virus in the ant-eating aphrodisiac that are very close to Sars Cove-2.
However, whether or not SARS Cove-2 moves to humans, as well as in whatever way it moves, through ant-eating animals and other mammals, its transport remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Merce-Koff was found in the lonely camels of a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local citizens.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control Merce, as did officials in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-KOV and SARS-KOV-2.
In order to stop Merce ' s repeated outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective anti-mers-Coffe vaccines for camels, as well as other anti-infection measures.
If we are unable to eliminate these viruses once and for all, new genetic patterns may emerge and cause outbreaks.
There is a variety of Corona viruses associated with animal-based diseases in wildlife.
In particular, Corona viruses are very diverse in bats that have the potential to cause animal-based diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and re-establishment of Corona viruses associated with animal-based diseases, leading to the emergence of new, more mobile and/or deadly Corona viruses in humans in the future.
The culture of wildlife use should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the light of the trials that humanity has endured because of Sars, Mers and Coved-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for too long.
They live in their own natural reserves until they have a chance to spread out and spread out.
Although bats carry many characteristics that are likely to spread viruses, human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
The continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure for a better understanding of the environment and natural hosts of the Corona viruses, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and future appearances.
Finally, the best way to prevent animal viral diseases is to move humans away from the environmental sites of animal-induced virus natural repositories.
The mystery of the origin of the disease is still the animal origin of Sars Cove-2, surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if the bats transmit the virus originating in Sars Cove-2 to the ants' curator, it is important to know the conditions that have been created for the sharing of bats and ant-eating animals in a similar environmental location.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human disease transmission, then how human contact should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of a true intermediary host, then how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying Sars Cove-2, both experimental monitoring and infection should be carried out.
Whether the host is a bat, or ant-eating or other mammals, it is expected to identify SARS Cove-2 or the parent viruses from which it is derived that are almost identical to its natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of Sars Cove-2 in animals, with important actions to prevent and control Coved-19 in humans.
Need to update the criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" in the diagnosis of Coved-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a fast-track guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the new Corona virus 2019 (the new Corona virus 2019), which provided our experience and provided appropriate baseline information to combat the pandemic worldwide.
Although corona 2019 (Coved-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; thus diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and presented the most recent diagnostic criteria, namely "suspected case" and "confirmed case," according to the most recent Coved-19 diagnosis and treatment guidance issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Corona virus spread 2019 (the new Corona virus 2019), now officially known as the Corona 2019 virus (Coved-19) virus and called the Corona 2 virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Coff-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described Coffed-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS Coff-2, our team formulated a quick guidance and published it online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He's had a lot of attention since his publication.
Please note that although Coffid 19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the Coved-19 diagnostic and treatment instructions issued by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, seven issues were issued, with some contexts fundamentally changed.
Our guidance has now been commented upon by Chu and others, who have made a simple suggestion for stairs monitoring based on clinical trial.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and have also become an invaluable reference for this pandemic throughout the world.
We support and appreciate their great effort.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest Coved-19 diagnostic guidance, his treatment (the seventh experimental edition) and recent studies.
According to Release VII (3 March 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case requires that any element of the epidemiological history characteristics be combined with two elements of the clinical appearances in order to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or that three elements of the clinical appearances be verified in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
An epidemiological history: (1) a date of travel to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities reported to have or to have had cases of Coveed 19, during the last 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (2) a date of communication with cases of SARS Cove-2 (with positive results of the DNA test); (3) a date of communication with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city, surrounding areas or other communities reported to have cases of Coveed 19 during the last 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (4) a date of communication with a combination of confirmed cases (2 or more cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms that occurred during 2 weeks in small areas, such as the home, office or school separation, etc.).
Clinical appearances: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics established by the imaging examination of the Coffid-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells at a normal, low or low level of lymphoma at the early stage of onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case, which involves any element of evidence of the presence of pathogens or blood serum reactions according to: (1) positive as a result of the real-time PCR test of Sars Cove 2; (2) the high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with the properties of the well-known emerging Corona viruses; (3) positive as a result of the test of the IgM and IgG antigen of Sars Cove-2 in the serum; or a negative to positive change of the IgG antibody of Sars Cove-2, or the rise in calibration in the recovery phase is equal to or more than four times that level in the acute phase.
In our opinion, the real-time polymerase DNA test in respiratory tracts or blood samples was added to Release II (18 January 2020) and Release III (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to Release IV (27 January 2020) and V (8 February 2020); the blood serum reaction manual was added to Release VII.
These adjustments have been based on the ongoing work of researchers to design an ideal tool kit for detection through rapid diagnosis DNA, as well as samples of respiratory tracts, including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and to support the transfer of the positive result of the anti-genetic object to confirmed case criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence to be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and unaccompanied cases.
The content of the information flow scheme for Chu and others should therefore be updated, as they classified the person free of clinical symptoms at the "low risk" level.
The grade monitoring system also needs to verify its validity in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to find more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
In order to diagnose the "suspected case" and the "confirmed case," we call for the follow-up of and adherence to the most recent guidance issued by home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in time for assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths due to Coved-19, the highest daily rate.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Koved-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that, as of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 cases of recovery were registered at home.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirgadi Sabrina Flora, stated at an online press conference that the deaths involved four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirgadi, there were two cases over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also said that two deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Kaufid-19 a pandemic on March 11th.
An official of the Anatolia Agency hospital, a local news agency, said that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being cared for at the Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
The Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaid Qader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transportation would stop longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
Public transport was initially disabled on March 26, and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of commodities is still permitted: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of Coffid 19 were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three have already recovered by March 19th.
The number of SARS casualties has exceeded 2 million worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the Corona virus causing acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was more than 1 million.
Coffid-19 ' s corona virus caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of the Corona virus, and the first associated deaths were recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, since Thursday, it was one of the few countries still free of Corona virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced 1051635 confirmed cases, including 79332 during the 24 hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European time (8800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of Corona virus were recorded in the United States of America, with at least 5,900 deaths associated.
According to Johns Hopkins University data, over 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday due to the Corona virus infection.
States around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Mr. Sergei Sobianin, Mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city would be extended until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries would continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, with 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Makkah Al-Mukarramah and Manawrah to all day; it was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand intends to impose a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mr. Mike de Wayne, announced that the state had extended the stay at home until May 1st.
Australia ' s stores reduce the purchase limits of toilet paper per transaction
The Australian stores ' chains Wall Worths and Cools on Saturday and Sunday evening emphasized the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Wallworths and one roll of Coles for every transaction in all branches nationwide.
Aldi's stores also identified one roll, Monday.
These purchase restrictions were published as payment points in store chains and on Facebook.
It has been reported that buyers stored them because of fears of Coffid-19's disease in case people need self-insulation.
On Wednesday, Wallworths established restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to become one roll for each purchase order.
These changes followed previous restrictions adopted by Wallworths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 by allowing only four rolls per transaction.
In its media statement of 8 March, Coles reported that, despite the application of the four wrapping restrictions, "many stores continue to sell all they have within an hour of receiving it," the application was described as "unprecedented," as well as by Aldie's stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unexpected."
Sales increased "a significant increase" last week, according to the Wallworths store spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the quantity allowed to be purchased was two rolls.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles' stores have asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery frequency, and Wallworth's stores have ordered additional stocks, while Aldi's stores have made their stocks available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery time made it difficult.
High production costs are expected, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few private offers.
On Tuesday, Aldie's stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores would not be able to provide their own Wednesday show.
In a report to News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retailer at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores were filled every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper was a large commodity, which led to a reduction in stock in terms of numbers, and when it was sold in full, it left large blank spaces on the shelves, thus enhancing the sense of shortage.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman stated: "Cools and Wallworths have a point of view that [if] there are many goods on the shelves, and if products such as toilet rolls and sterilizers can be [purchased] and supplied in large quantities, this may reduce panic."
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that its stock ran out.
According to the News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Klinks toilet paper, and Solaris Piper, which produces Sorbent napkins, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors provided free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of the UNT News, a daily publication in Darwin, contained eight pages of advertisements made so that they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
The shops initially hesitated to impose restrictions, according to a report issued by ABC Australia on March 3, where they stated that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other products, including gags, sterilizers, dried goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday evening it was observed that an online British store called Okado identified the purchases of toilet paper by Andris with two caskets of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares Coffid 19 to be a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the continued outbreak of Coffid-19 - a disease caused by the Corona virus associated with acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - known as SARS Cove-2 - had reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word "infestation" refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the seriousness of specific situations, WHO has drawn attention to the need for Governments to take the necessary measures:
"All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Gibresus, said: "If countries discover, test, treat and isolate people, track their cases and mobilize to confront them."
"We are all very concerned by the levels of proliferation, the alarming seriousness, as well as the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is "unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February, "no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued global spread, other than the flu."
Gipressos expressed a similar view: "We have never experienced a pandemic caused by a Corona virus."
Go on: "We've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the decision of the World Health Organization in January to declare the outbreak of a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Sensitivity and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauche, said about the outbreak: "In short, things will get worse."
Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of Coved-19 worldwide from Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The Corona 2019-20 virus pandemic is an ongoing disease of the Corona 2019 virus (Coved-19), caused by the Corona 2 virus associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of cavity 19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China ' s mortality rate was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 88% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment.
Basic therapy is a supportive treatment and symptoms, including recommended protective measures, hand washing, oral coughing, keeping people apart, monitoring and self-segregation of suspected victims.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and lockdowns.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic unrest, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by the panic of procurement.
Schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
There have been false information about HIV on the Internet, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas where there have been significant HIV infections.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there was a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan City (Hope County Capital), China, reported a series of cases of pneumonia for an unknown reason on 31 December 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan Seafood Market for wholesale sale, and the virus is therefore believed to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS Cove-2, a newly discovered virus closely associated with the Corona virus in the bats, the Corona virus in the ants, and SARS-Koff. Later, it was discovered that the first person to show symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have a clear connection with the wet market group that was discovered later.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by South China's morning newspaper indicated that a case dating from November 17, 2019, 55 years old from Hopi County, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that, although new cases in China were reported to have decreased, they suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with light symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, with 19 years old and 2.4% of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's Senior Scientific Adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of the British would need to be infected before an effective herd could be immune.
Cases refer to the number of persons examined by Koffid 19 and confirmed their injuries in accordance with the official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies regarding the non-testing of those with only minor symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that an estimated 86% of Coved-19 cases had not been detected in China, until 23 January, and that these unregistered injuries were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of injuries in Italy was significantly higher than the cases recorded.
Preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) of Coved-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people affected by Caved-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, it takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days, from the deterioration of symptoms to death.
As of April 10, 2020, Coffid 19 caused some 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China were concentrated from 5 February in those over 60 years of age, and 75% were suffering from pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths due to the Coved-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased people who have been found to be infected with cavity according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths from Coffid-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people dying without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Koved deaths recorded in the 4.5x coefficient.
The spokesman for the US CDC acknowledged that "we know [the number of reported deaths] reflects a lower estimate than reality," a statement supported by narrative reports indicating an inaccurate inventory in the US. Such a lack of estimates occurs in pandemic situations; for example, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic was the first confirmed death in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
It was the first death outside the mainland of China on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia in France on February 14.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside China ' s mainland in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region over time, influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options and time taken since the onset of the disease, and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health. The mortality to injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality to injury ratio is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of mortality from injuries decreased from 17.3% (for those who showed symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who showed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to the CFR case mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease, and the rate of infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those who are infected (those who have been found to have been infected and those who have not been confirmed) who die from an illness.
These statistics have no time frame and follow a specific population from injury to the fate of the situation.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-based Medicine estimates that the overall rate of infection mortality for the pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range corresponds to the results of the first random test of Coffid 19 in Germany, and to a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the estimates of the mortality rate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Massage Bonnie from Pennsylvania State University stated: "The outbreak of uncontrollable infectious diseases usually reaches a peak and starts to decline thereafter when no host is available.
But it's almost impossible to come up with any reasonable expectation now about the timing of this."
Chinese Government Senior Medical Adviser Chung Nanshan stated that "it could end by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to halt the spread of HIV.
On March 17, Adam Kocharski of the London School of Health and Hotland Medicine stated that SARS Cove-2 "will be deployed perhaps for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial London College under world supervision, Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical spacing and other measures "to make a vaccine available" (perhaps 18 months or more later).
William Shafner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think this Corona virus is unlikely to disappear completely - because it is easily transferable," and it may "turn into a seasonal disease - so that it returns every year."
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of transformation.
Koved-19's symptoms may be relatively undefined and may not show symptoms on the infected.
The two most common offers are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory gossip (bell), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, throat infection, headaches, chills, vomiting, blood breathing, diarrhoea, or blue. The World Health Organization (WHO) asserts that approximately one in six people is severely affected by the disease and has difficulty breathing.
The CDC in the United States confines emergency symptoms to breathing difficulty, pain or constant pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking up, and lacerations of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms arise.
There may be no symptoms for some of the injured, who do not have clinical symptoms but whose injuries are confirmed by the results of the analysis, so specialists have advised that persons in contact with the confirmed cases must be closely monitored and examined in order to exclude the injury.
Chinese estimates of the number of cases without symptoms range from a few to 44%.
The usual period of custody (the period between injury and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is often five days. For example, in a state of confusion, the proportion of people infected with Coffide 19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30%, and the rate has recently dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spreading are still under consideration.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during mixing or through the dispersion of spray at coughing, sneezing or speaking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that cough without a mouth cover may result in spray scattered from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus can also be transmitted by long-sprayed spray in the air, which can be produced in conversation. A respiratory spray can also be produced during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is not transmitted by air in general.
Sprays may fall on the mouths or noses of close persons or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary CPR, may trigger respiratory release in the form of spray and thus cause air-borne spread.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from stool to mouth, it is believed that the risk is limited.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of SARS Cove-2 moving from feces to mouth. The virus is more contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People were diagnosed with the disease up to three days before the onset of the symptoms, indicating the possibility of moving before severe symptoms.
There are few reports of cases without laboratoryly confirmed symptoms, but the uncontrolled movement of some countries has been identified during MSLs.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about the ease of spread of the disease, one person can count from two to three more in general. The virus remains on the surface from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and rust-resistant steel type 304, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. The incidence of pets and other animals with cavity 19 has been confirmed.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, yet British authorities recommend washing hands after mixing animals, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
The Corona 2 virus associated with acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove 2) is an emerging virus, where three people who were suffering from pneumonia were first isolated in combination with a range of cases with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
The SARS Cove-2 virus shares all of its properties with the Corona viruses found in nature. Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, where its protective membrane is dissolved. SARS Cove-2 is closely associated with the original SARS Cove virus.
It's thought to have animal origin.
Gene analysis revealed that the Corona virus meets genetically with the species of the Corona Beta virus, and falls under the subsex of the Corona Sarpe virus (B strain) plus two bat breeds.
96% match the entire genome with other samples of corona viruses in bats (Pat Cove Rat G-13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses originating from ant-eating and human-induced viruses.
A comparison of the entire genome so far has resulted in the discovery of at least 92% of genetic material between the Corona ant-eating virus and SARS-Coff-2 virus, which is insufficient to prove that ant-eating is the intermediate parent of the virus.
HIV infection can be diagnosed on a temporary basis based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the reaction of the serial polymerase to the reverse versions (RRT-BCR) of the infected excreta or CTCR.
A study in Wuhan city comparing the effects of serial polymers with computerized ctography indicated that computerized CT was more sensitive than the reaction of serial polymers, although less accurate, with many of its imaging features interfering with other cases of pneumonia and pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American Radiography College recommends "no use of CT to detect Koved-19 or consider it a preliminary diagnosis test."
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several protocols for the DNA test of SARS Cove-2, for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of the Reverse Polymerase series (RTPR) in real time.
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally conducted through a nostril osteoporosis swab, and can also be used by a throat swab. A number of laboratories and companies are developing vaccine tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently precise to be widely used.
A serum test developed by Sélix has been certified for use in emergencies in the United States only in accredited laboratories.
Photographic properties of X-rays and CT images of people suffering from symptoms of the disease include a non-symmetry of terminal effects, such as classified glass fog and a confused crystal filter.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of the results of confirmed-incidence imaging.
Radiography without a chain polymer reaction is a low-precision procedure for the detection of Koffid-19; this is because it interferes with other diseases such as gland virus infection.
A major study in China compared the results of the C.T. and the chain polymer reaction and showed that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it is a screening tool in the endemic areas.
Artificial IQ-based telepathic neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of HIV imaging in both X-rays and CT scans.
Prevention strategies include maintaining generally good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief for coughing or sneezing and then disposing of it directly in the trash.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public places.
Physical spacing procedures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised not to travel.
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
Health-care providers, who take care of a person who is likely to be infected, are advised to use significant measures, mixing precautions, and eye protection. Tracking people is an effective way to help health authorities identify the source of infection and prevent its spread.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for tracking has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
Many mobile phone applications have been designed or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have been working on privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person who has been found to be infected with Caved 19. Misperceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, nose washing and gargling with oral wash are not a viable solution.
There is still no LCV-19 vaccine, although many organizations have been working to produce a vaccine.
It's recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the dirt appears on the hands, before eating, after nose, cough or sneezing.
That's because domestic soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommended the use of a hand sterilizer containing alcohol at least 60% when water and soap are not available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, noses or mouths with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of placing the disinfectant on the surface of stainless steel), including Ethanol 62-71%, Isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopavedon 0.2-7.5%.
There are other disinfectants, such as benzalconium chloride and glucone chloride, with less efficiency.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected of having suffered cavity or is confirmed to have been injured in a facility such as an office or a care centre, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces and joint electronic devices such as tablet devices, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and ATMs used by the patient must be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either by fending the elbow and putting it in front of the mouth and nose or by using paper napkins and immediately disposing of any napkins.
Those who are likely to be injured are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the volume of respiratory spray and the distance it travels when dispersed by talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at Leeds University, "the wearing of a mask of [people's] desire to touch their faces can be reduced, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned."
WHO recommended wearing masks only if they were at high risk of infection, such as those caring for Caved 19, although it also recognized that wearing masks might help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The US CDC recommends wearing a non-medical facial mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended healthy people to use disposable medical masks, especially in the case of people in association (1 m (3 feet) or less) directly.
Recommends Hong Kong to wear a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make masks of cloth at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited access to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked the entire population to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that train passengers and inter-city buses wear masks on April 1st.
Panama had to wear a face mask when it came out necessary, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who could not afford face masks.
Facial masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social spacing (also known as physical spacing) includes measures to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing intermingling individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
Individuals can apply social divides by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, untouched greeting exchanges, and physically separating from others.
Many Governments are currently imposing or recommending social exclusion in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of assemblies recommended by American government bodies and health organizations has been reduced rapidly from 250 people (if no prevalence of Coved-19 in the region) to 50, and 10 later.
Older people and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and weak immune systems face an increased risk of serious illness and complications. The CDC advised them to stay at home as far as possible in areas of intercommunity outbreak.
The use of the term "social distance" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health directives for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations that only a person with whom you live who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms should have sex.
Self-segregation is recommended at home for those infected with Coffid 19 and those suspected of having been injured.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-segregation, which several governments have imposed or recommended for self-seizure for all people living in affected areas.
The strongest self-censorship instructions were issued to those of the most vulnerable groups.
Those who have dealt with a person with Coved-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where there has been widespread self-inflicted quarantine for 14 days from another time have been advised of possible exposure.
The strategies to control the outbreak are containment or restraint and reduction of prevalence.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected persons as well as to introduce other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When containment of the spread of the disease is not possible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health-care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken at the same time.
Restriction requires more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of infectious diseases attempts to reduce the epidemic's peak, as defined by the impact of the epidemic's curve.
This reduces the risk of stress in health services and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand cleaning, masking and quarantine; community actions aimed at physical dispersion, such as school closures and cancellations of major gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as roof cleaning. More stringent measures were taken to contain the outbreak in China as soon as the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other States have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of HIV.
South Korea has introduced group tests and local quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those who had isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who had not done so.
Taiwan has increased mask production and criminalized the acquisition of medical supplies. The simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and restraint (in contrast to the growth of the epidemic) are facing significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce the peak demand for health care by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress in health systems.
Restriction may be preferable, but it must be maintained as long as the virus spreads in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), since on the other hand, transmission is quickly rebounding when measures are reduced.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiretroviral drugs approved for Coved 19, but development efforts are under way, including testing of existing medicines.
The use of non-prescription cold medication and the drinking of fluids and rest may help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on severity, treatment with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the consequences.
Many of the previously approved compounds for other viral diseases are subject to screening for use in Coved-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) also stated that some "traditional and home-based treatments" could provide mitigation of the symptoms caused by SARS Coffed-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care centres to meet the needs of Coved-19 patients by the World Health Organization (WHO) have been described as essential measures for responding to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on the Coved-19 test, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating people with Coved-19, increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories as to where the first case originated (so-called patient 0).
The first known case of the new Corona virus could date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hobi, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of the Corona virus in Hopi has gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Wuhan market for seafood for wholesale sale, which sells live animals as well, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species of animals; in other words, it has animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on December 26 and was dealt with by Dr. Zhang Jisyan at Hobei County Hospital, which reported to the Jianghan Bohan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "the Corona virus looks like Sars."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wen Liang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ivin, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising alarms.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and notified WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the Wuhan health authorities, prompting them to begin their investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In the early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during New China's New Year, the Huan Transport Centre and the main railway crossing point.
On 20 January, China reported approximately 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Schengen.
As of 26 March, the United States has outnumbered China and Italy by the world's highest number of confirmed infections. As of April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million people worldwide have been reported to have died and over 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 States and territories registered at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping orders, place-to-place protection orders, or closures) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had been subjected to one form of closure in the US, over 50 million had been closed in the Philippines, about 59 million had been closed in South Africa, and 1.3 billion had been closed in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were subjected to one form of closure, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of Coved-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Zhejiyan observed a series of cases of pneumonia that were unknown on December 26, and her hospital was subsequently informed of the Jianghan Bohan Disease Control Centre on December 27.
A first genetic test of patients ' samples on 27 December 2019 indicated a Corona virus similar to SARS.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Committee issued a public notice on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about the "spraying of rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of moving from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Shi Jin Ping as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
While described as the "largest quarantine in human history," a health tour was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hopi, affecting some 57 million people.
Private vehicles in the city have been banned.
Chinese New Year's celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities have also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hooshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built after that, the Lyshchan Hospital, to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and playgrounds, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the Koved-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to passengers and extending spring festival holidays.
Universities and schools have also been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Restrictions were imposed on travel within and outside Hopi.
Public transport has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement has been controlled in several cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to a form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took firm measures to prevent "true" the virus to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all returnees from other countries. On March 23, one case moved locally in mainland China over the past five days, through a passenger returning to Gwanzo from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese State Council President Lee Kah Chiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and the control of outbreaks in China had been reversed.
The travel restrictions in Hopi were eased on the same day, except for Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a suspension of visa holders or residence permits from March 28 up, with no specific details as to when the policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will be obliged to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and provided a monetary stimulus package for companies. The state council declared a three-minute blacksmith's day of silence on April 4th at 10:00, in conjunction with the Cheng Ming Festival, although the central government demanded that families show respect over the Internet in order to take account of the physical distance to avoid the Koved-19 outbreak again.
Coved-19's transfer from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributable to a gathering in Diego of a new religious movement known as the Church of Chincheungi Jesus.
It was suspected that Shincheongi's followers visiting Daejo from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people or about 13% of the 9,336 church followers reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers confirmed that they were infected with the virus.
South Korea has implemented a program that is considered the largest and best organized in the world to examine people for the virus, isolate any infected person, and track their mixtures and quarantine them.
The screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, HIV testing for people in their cars, with testing results available the following day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak, although quarantine has not been applied to entire cities. South Korea's society was initially divided about President Moon Jae In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the isolation of Mon, claiming that the Government has abused the outbreak of the disease, or commending its response.
On March 23, South Korea was declared to have had the lowest total in one day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries for HIV testing assistance.
Iran reported the first confirmed SARS-Kov-2 case on 19 February at Qam, where two people died later on the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early actions announced by the Government included the abolition of concerts, other cultural events, sports events, Friday prayers, the closure of universities, institutes of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to combat the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani stated that there was no plan for areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be isolated.
Plans to limit inter-city travel were announced in March, although intensive inter-city traffic continued prior to the new Persian Norse year.
The Shiite tombs remained open until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of allegations of Iran ' s cover-up of the outbreak, more than 10 countries traced their cases from Iran from February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak might exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government to date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have been infected with HIV on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch demanded that Iranian prison authorities unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful opposition, as well as eligible prisoners.
She stated that there was a high risk of HIV spreading in closed places, such as in detention, which also lacked adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current and former Iranian politicians and government officials died of the disease by 17 March.
By March 23, Iran had recorded 50 new infections at 1:00, and 1 case of death every 10 minutes due to the Corona virus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be five times that reported.
It is also believed that United States sanctions against Iran may affect the financial capacity of the State to respond to the spread of the virus.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for the reduction of economic sanctions against the States most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when Sars-Koff-2 tests came to positive Chinese tourists in Rome.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated set of Koved-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new decree containing the outbreak, including quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté said, "He will not be allowed to enter or exit areas of the outbreak.
Work activities and sports events in those areas have already been ordered to be suspended." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including first-class football tournaments, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sports events were suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of nearly all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Sacrifice, Recovery and Focused Care (SIAARTI) published the medical ethics recommendations regarding the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy outnumbered China as the country that experienced the largest number of deaths associated with the Corona virus in the world after 3,405 deaths from the pandemic were reported.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, confirmed cases amounted to 128.948, with 15.887, and recovered 21,815 in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardia region.
The CNN report noted that a combination of a large number of older persons and the inability to test all people living with HIV to date in Italy may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
For the first time, the United Kingdom's response to HIV was shown to be the most relaxed among the affected countries, and as at 18 March 2020, the British Government had not imposed any form of social exclusion or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its marked lack of speed and intensity in responding to public fears. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising that unnecessary travel or social mixing should be avoided, suggesting that people should work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to £2,500 a month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social-disparity measures, banning assemblies for more than two people and restricting travel and activity outside the home except for the most necessary.
Contrary to previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police through the issuance of fines and the break-up of assemblies.
Most companies have been ordered to close down, with the exception of "essential" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control - the leading public health institute of the United States Government - announced that it had developed its own test group.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the start of the test, blocking the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The test damaged a flawed test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of non-governmental test groups (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restricted criteria for persons to qualify for the test until early March (the doctor was required thereafter).
By February 27, Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, the Atlantic stated that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

As of March 15, many companies have shut down or reduced their working hours throughout the United States in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On March 23, 10,700 cases of the Corona virus were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that the social divide seemed to have been successful, with estimates showing that the situation had slowed from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died of the virus. On March 26, more confirmed cases of Corona virus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend the social divide directive until April 30.
On the same day, USNScomfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the Corona virus within 24 hours.
The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling the circulation of news by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public data and publications on HIV with Vice President Mike Penny's office.
Trump's management of the crisis was not universally well received as it created a broad polarization between the parties.
Some American officials and commentators criticized the United States' reliance on the import of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict proliferation patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as famous destinations for passengers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least able of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered to be more capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the new Corona 19 virus on February 7.
She stated that not much had yet been discovered about the Coved-19 virus, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a Human Biosecurity Emergency was declared in Australia.
Given the impact of effective quarantine on public transport in Wuhan and Hobei, several States planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with permits provided by the Chinese authorities.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.

On February 21, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princeship.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, it returned a plane from South African Airlines, which was leased by the South African government to 112 South Africans.
The medical examination was conducted prior to departure, leaving four Southern Africans who showed signs of the Corona virus to mitigate the risks.
Southern Africans were returned whose test results were only negative.
The results of the test showed that southern Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom, as a preventive measure, remained under surveillance and quarantine at the ranch resort for 14 days, were not injured.
On March 20, the United States began to withdraw its troops partially from Iraq because of the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that 21 countries (including White Russia, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent assistance to China.

Businessman Jack Ma sent to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits distributed by the African Union.
Later sent to Panama 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five artificial respirators.
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 of China ' s DNA test kits, which were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime the Netherlands returned 600,000 of China ' s faulty facial masks.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable facial masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed Chinese aid well received. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of the blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid panic before the New Moon Year's holiday."
On January 23, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement the Woohan transport ban, WHO representative Gooden Galia noted that, while this "is certainly not a recommendation made by WHO," it was "a very important indicator of commitment to containing the epidemic where it is concentrated" and described it as "unprecedented in the history of public health." On January 30, after confirming the move from one person to another outside China, and increasing the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (BHCAC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the first resort to this procedure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the consideration of prevalence as a public health emergency of international concern was due to the "risk of global proliferation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tidros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unduly conflict with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend a reduction in trade and mobility."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds developed in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that "have no systems to detect people living with HIV, even if it appears."
Tedros also made statements declaring that "our strength is measured by the power of the weakest among us" and urging the international community to "invest today or pay a large price later." On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the disease, at a press conference, Koffed-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been developed, which has made it possible to coordinate the entire United Nations response, and WHO will allow it "to focus on health response while drawing on the expertise of other agencies to learn about the social, economic and broader development impacts of the outbreak."
On February 14, a WHO-led joint mission team with China was developed to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local governance and assess "severe disease and transmission" through hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city levels, including urban and rural areas." On February 25, WHO announced that "the world needs to do more to prepare for the potential Corona virus pandemic," noting that it is too early to describe as a pandemic, but that States should be "prepared."
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment of the Corona virus would rise from "high" to "high," its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in a statement that "This is a real test for every government on Earth: so we have to prepare.
This virus may be on its way and you must prepare for it," and he urged that the right response measures be taken that can help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data do not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means that "we basically accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of Corona as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the World Health Organization (WHO) was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and distress, and the alarming levels of inaction." The World Health Organization (WHO) faced severe criticism of what was perceived as an inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Violent reactions included a petition by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tidros Adhanum to resign, signed as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts confirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the Coffid-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right and responsibility to life-saving interventions.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, members of minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extremely poor conditions, and detainees, as well as refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the Koved-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes the State policy tracking tool, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Corona virus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, British Secretary of Cabinet Michael Goff, and Edward Bolsonaro, son of Brazil's President Jayer Bolsonaro, for the way she dealt with the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hopi.
A number of CBC directors have been dismissed at a cross-sectoral level for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, citing dissatisfaction with the political institution ' s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Shi Jin Ping from public dissatisfaction with the outbreak of the Corona virus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Chow Ligian, refused a prior confession that the outbreak of the Corona virus had begun in Wuhan, in favour of the conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the Coved-19 virus.
The U.S. Department of Donald Trump described the Corona virus as a "Chinese virus" or a "wohan virus," saying that China "imposed a blackout on the news that exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic," which some critics criticized for being racist "and distracts [the attention] from his administration's failure to contain the disease."
Dili Best obtained a wire from the U.S. government that reviews the communications scheme with clear sources in the NSC, with a strategy stating that "everything is about China.
We have been asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "News sources such as Politico, Forin Polesi and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by HIV are part of a propaganda drive for global influence.
European Union Foreign Policy Officer Josep Burrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through circumvention and generosity policies."
Borrell also said: "China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and trusted partner."
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sends assistance to the last two countries.
The United States sanctions banned Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
The American authorities have also been accused of transferring assistance that was being directed to other countries to their countries.
There were mask disputes reported between other States, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the Corona virus.
Mauritsu Masari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said: "China has responded only bilaterally.
Sure, that's not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military paramedics, special purge vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa reported a "high-level political source" whose name did not mention that 80% of Russia's aid was "in vain or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of initiating a remarkable "geographical and diplomatic" attack.
The President of Lombardi, Atilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi de Mayo, denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitry Pskov said that "when assisting his American colleagues, Putin assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to repay the favor if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercises will be conducted in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war maneuver since the end of the cold war on a small scale.
"In view of the current public health crisis, training not only endangers the lives of troops from the US and many of the participating European countries, but also the population of the countries in which they are to be conducted." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with some 20 members of parliament infected, along with 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the spread of the disease because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak raised calls for the US to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive childcare, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined at designated government locations for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the isolation of Moon because they claim that the government mistook the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic has allowed States to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this might allow Governments to tighten their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Victor Orbán to rule by indefinite decree, suspend Parliament as well as elections and punish those who disseminated false information about HIV and the Government's handling of the crisis.
The outbreak of the Corona virus was blamed for many shortages of supplies due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-induced procurement, and the disruption of plant operation and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the suspension of suppliers.
Many areas also experienced panic-induced procurement, resulting in groceries free of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper and bottles of water, which resulted in a lack of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned against delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tidus Adhanum, the demand for personal protective devices has increased by 100 times.
This demand increased prices by up to 20 times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed by four to six months.
It also caused a lack of personal protection tools worldwide, with WHO warning that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego's shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread cases of Koved-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, followed by high demand for food products, both regions survived severe food shortages.
The actions taken by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trade in vital products have succeeded in avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant decline in its large agricultural production, but prices may rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan City, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep stocks of such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government actions to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since China ' s mainland is a major economic and industrial centre, it has been observed that the spread of the virus poses a major and destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris expected the economic intelligence unit to remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible consequences was shown.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic repercussions of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by over $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reported to have experienced "disenchantment" following a sharp decline in oil prices due to reduced demand from China.
World equity markets declined on February 24, owing to the large rise in the number of cases of Coffid-19 outside China's mainland.
On 27 February, owing to growing fears about the spread of the Corona virus, many United States equity indicators, including NASDAQ-100, Standard and Bowers 500, and the Dow Jones industrial average have been the largest drop since 2008, with Dow 1,191 drops, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indicators of the week are down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoob Rattings JMPH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
The stock regressed because of fears of the Corona virus, and was the biggest drop on March 16th.
Many believe that economic stagnation is possible.
The economist Mohamed Al-Eryan commended the emergency measures being taken by central banks and States in a timely manner.
Central banks respond faster than they were in the financial meltdown of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the warning of Governments to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights because of low demand, including British airlines, East Chinese airlines and Kansas, while British regional airlines collapsed, Flybee.
The impact on the sea lanes industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been shut down.
The epidemic coincided with the spring travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the New Chinese New Year's holiday.
National and regional governments have eliminated a number of large crowd actors, including New Year ' s celebrations, with private companies also closing their shops independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Several new lunar year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the forbidden city in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country ' s gross domestic product and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled the New Year celebrations. The retail sector worldwide has been affected by reduced shop hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centers around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, the installation of heat scanners to check shoppers' temperature, and the elimination of efficiency. According to ECLAC estimates, the recession caused by the pandemic can leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than would have suffered this situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers have been trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in the Hopi district. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The closure in India has left tens of millions of unemployed Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages). An Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have suffered some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into government-supported short-term work plans known as Korzarbit.
France and the United Kingdom have adopted the German short-term compensation plan.
The theatrical arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals - workers and independents - globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector have sought to support their mission (mostly funded by the Government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, to preserve the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists to the extent possible.
By March 2020, worldwide to varying degrees, museums, libraries, show places and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, presentations or postponements cancelled.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerating consequences of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as musical festivals, concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also suffered a pause, and the Vatican has announced the cancellation of the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian repenting season in the Great fast.
Many Christian parishes recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sundays; some churches made church services available on radio, live webcasts or television, while others worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic parish in Rome, its churches and church chapel, and the evacuation of St. Peter's square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also abolished limited public services and assemblies in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gordora.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and subsequently closed the tombs, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as residents into holy sites in Mecca and the city.
This pandemic has caused the biggest imbalance in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the European Champions ' League 2019-20, the Excellent League 2019-20, the European League 2020, the Order of the American Professional Basketball League 2019-20 and the National Hockey League 2019-20.
The outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the effectiveness "will be rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021." Gambling clubs and other playgrounds around the world were closed and direct gambling tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gamblers reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres like those in Broadway have hung up all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share work online as an alternative to traditional direct performance, such as live broadcast parties or online "celebrating" artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many Internet memes of the Corona virus have spread over the Internet, where many have turned into humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the Koved-19 outbreak, strong prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese origin and the Asian East, and against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports issued in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world towards the Chinese that they were entitled to the virus or were receiving allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also been rising in some African countries.
Many of the people of Wuhan and Hobei reported discrimination on the basis of their territorial origin.
There was support for Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in HIV-affected areas.
After the outbreak in new hot spots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to witness a massive outbreak of Coffid 19, may be exposed to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed pressure petitions to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, Hashtag Chinese DontCome To Japan.
The Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racial violations, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the Corona virus as a "Chinese virus," a term that critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, who share the border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, have been harassed by the outbreak of the Corona virus.
The head of the BJP's unit in West Bengal state, Dileep Gush, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, describing them as "mistake." In China, the pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted "to get rid of them."
Many newspapers have removed subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the Corona virus.
Many scientific publishers have made the scientific papers on the outbreak available for open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

The lab test of CORNA respiratory virus 2019 (Coved-19) and SARS-KOV-2 associated virus includes methods for detecting the existence of the virus where antibodies produced in response to infection are identified.
RTCR confirms that there are viruses in the samples, where the rebuzi DNA of the Corona virus is detected.
This test is accurate and designed only for the detection of the DNA of SARS-KOV-2.
Used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serum science) is used to diagnose and control the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too simple to report or who did not show symptoms.
The precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on HIV prevalence among its population.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there was considerable variation in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This disparity is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
The instantalytic polymers reaction to the reverse replica (RTCR) can be used to screen respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including nasal osteoporosis or phmogram samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Only in the first week of the disease is RTCR, which is performed using throat swabs.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to reproduce in the lungs.
For injured persons subject to screening in the second week, a sample of deep airway can instead be taken by catheterization or use of cough (gellature).
An early PCR test was developed in Berlin in January 2020 using the instantalytic polymer reaction to reverse versions (RRT-BCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 test sets distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also invented a softwareChek Coronavirus virus (SAR-Coff-2) suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-Kov-2 detection crew. In the United States, CDCs distribute a diagnostic plate for the new Corona 2019 virus (the new Corona 2019) that relies on RTC-R-N-N-N-N-N-L-L-L-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions of test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one test stage was delayed at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the successful completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout the whole month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under the emergency use permit. The United States commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LapCorp announced the availability of Coffid-19's test nationwide based on RTTCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostex made the Coffid-19 test available throughout the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced; withdrawal and treatment of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Centre for Research on Virology and Biotechnology invented and produced the Koved-19 test.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Klinick had developed a Coved-19 infection test. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostex obtained the FDA's approval for a 3.5-hour test in large numbers, allowing one machine to run nearly 4128 tests over 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (EUA) granted permission for emergency use to Abbott Labs for testing on the Abbott M2000 system; previously, the Food and Drug Administration granted a similar permit to Hooligic, Lapcorp and Thermo Fisher Sentevic.
On March 21, 2020, Seyed obtained a similar emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a 45-minute test.
The Food and Drug Administration has agreed to a test using the same-tempered DNA amplification technique instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative outcomes in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and expect to boost manufacturing to carry out 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test using a single-cell antibody associated specifically with the protein N nuclear cap protein of the new Corona virus, in the hope that it will be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as the rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "the chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed CT] may be clear even before the symptoms appear."
The usual characteristics that appear in the computerized CT scans include binomialized glass amulets with an ocean distribution that is not uniform and backwards.
A spread under the side is evolving, with irregular patches emerging and intensifying as the disease develops.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing PCR with computerized CT scans with the origin of the current pandemic indicated that CT scans were more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its graphic properties interfering with other cases of pneumonia and pathological stages.
In March 2020, the U.S. Radiological School recommends "no use of CT scans to detect Kaved-19 or a preliminary diagnosis test." In March 2020, CDC recommends use of PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect individual injuries within a period of 7 days or after symptoms, to determine immune capacity and, in the case of population surveillance, can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by testing the clinical care point (BCT).
The high-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production per system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of ocean blood cells is usually used, although it is possible to use consecutive samples to follow up on the immune response.
For the clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by skin piercing.
Unlike the BCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be taken prior to the examination. On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 agencies that submitted a notification to the agency in accordance with the requirements, and they are able to distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration adopted only one test under its emergency-use permit. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitube Diagnostics obtained European credits for their test crews, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR DNA analysis.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In April, the UK discovered that the antibodies test crews it purchased were not good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients suspected of injury can stay at home, "Give the emergency department a sample tube to patients," spit in the tube, and re-spit it to get the test result after a simple period. The British National Health Service announced that it is experimenting with a plan to test suspected cases at home, thereby excluding the risk of infection from the injured when they come to hospital or the need to sterilize the used ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors stated on 2 March that it had been able to conduct about 12,000 outpatient tests per day and that 10,700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance shall bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 weekly tests.
On March 19 tests of the virus were made available in the car in many major cities.
On March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive case results were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that from calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested until the end of the week 12/2020, with 33,491 positive samples (6.9%) of SARS-Coff-2. In Israel, strangulation researchers and Rambam Hospital had devised a method for screening samples from 64 patients at the same time, by collecting samples and conducting further tests only when the sample was found to be positive.
With Wang Jian, founder of BGI, supervising construction work and taking up 5 days, modelling showed that the cases in Hopi would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that test capacity had not been completed.
The Wu-Yan Laboratory immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shengen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Oregami Assays issued open source and multi-send designs that can test up to 1122 samples of a patient to detect Koffid-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for mechanical liquid treatments.
In March, the shortage and insufficiency of detector materials caused a dilemma when a large number of tests were conducted in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols involving the heating of samples at 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees F) for five minutes to release the Rebuzi DNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was at the top of the world's population in terms of the rate of testing the Corona virus, and was on its way to raising the test level to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of the activation of the in-car test capability and the purchase of a highly productive laboratory with a range suitable for the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The lab was established within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RTCR tests to be performed daily, the first lab in the world this size to operate outside China.
Various testing methods have been devised targeting different parts of the genetic features of the Corona virus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German Crew Industry Plan, which is sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying the tests available in the US. China and the US faced problems with the reliability of test crews early on infestation, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate sets to meet demand and follow the test recommendations of health experts.
In contrast, experts stated that the abundance of tests in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the emerging Corona virus.
The South Korean government has significantly enhanced testing capacity in private-sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the intensification of testing programmes as the best solution to reduce the progress of the Coffid-19 pandemic. Increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests accumulated in special American laboratories, and has also disrupted the supply of surveys and chemical detectors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test crews.
In the US, "negatives" were found in the test crews invented by CDC; the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain purchased test crews from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found that the results were inaccurate.
KUFPEC explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the crews correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will decline to purchase crews that have given incorrect results, and will replace them with other test crews from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test crews purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.
Professor Ach Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that Turkey's test crews purchased from China had a "high error rate" and had "banning its use." The United Kingdom also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by a quarantine of those found to have been infected and those who were mixed with Sars-Koff-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which witnessed the first case of death in Pagod-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Nearly half of the people whose tests were positive showed no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new infections have been completely eliminated.
The Corona 2020 virus pandemic in Singapore experienced a significant decline in prevalence compared with other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities; through strict tracking of mixtures and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun to urge the population to stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on March 23 on time after the holiday.
Several other States have also taken control of the pandemic through strict tracking of mixtures and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have conducted more tests than deaths have much lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with only minor or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on Coffid-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of Coved-19 to one of the 16 WHO laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 approved laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the "positive percentage of tests" column is influenced by the state's policy of testing.
The state that conducts tests only for persons transferred to hospital will have positive cases with a percentage point higher than the state that tests for all its inhabitants, whether they appear to have symptoms or not, considering the equality of other factors.
The washing of hands (or washing of hands), also known as hand cleaning, is the cleaning of hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, micro-organisms or other unwanted substances.
The continuous washing of hands with soap at certain "essential times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, that travel through the oral anal road.
People can also experience respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after the shit, after cleaning the baby's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing food or dealing with meat, fish or raw poultry and after.
If there is no water and soap, the hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before preparing the food, in the meantime, and after it.
Before taking care of a sick person and after him.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning them up after using them for the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, sneezing.
After touching animals, feeding them, or rubbish.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medicines or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand-washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, the Corona virus and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrhoea-causing infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduced infant mortality rates at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in the growth of height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates for respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced through simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures to encourage hand washing of diarrhoea can be reduced by nearly one third, similar to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
48% of reduced diarrhoeal seizures can be associated with hand-washing. Hand-washing with soap is the only most effective and less expensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when applying spontaneous behaviour in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with some 1.8 million children dying annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause the death of about 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, the conversion of hand washing with soap before eating and after the use of the toilet to an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (water, sanitation and hygiene).
The washing of hands also protects against herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
The simple harmful effect of washing hands is that repeated washing of hands can lead to dehydration of skin.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that overwashing hands can lead to a skin case of peeling and itching known as hand eczema or hand skin infection, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
The washing of hands is also often seen too often as a symptom of OCD.
There are five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the transmission of diseases across the oral anal road: after using the bathroom (pissing, pooping), after cleaning the baby's butt (change of diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, before/after preparing food or dealing with meat, fish or raw poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be used in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or dealing with animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is declining.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households were washing their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97%, and the US is approaching the centre by 77%, and China by 23%.
The "Basic Health Care Programme" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of widespread action to promote children's health and education.
Twice a year, in addition to daily hand washing with soap and brushing of teeth on a daily fluoride, worm therapy is at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to reduce decomposition barriers and increase melting.
Only water is inert for skin because fat and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not readily degraded in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to cleanse...
Because of its reusable nature, solid soap may carry bacteria acquired from past uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission of contaminated solid soap have concluded that transport is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to state that "Lousine soap is preferred from non-touched soap-pumping devices."
Antibacterial soap has been promoted significantly to health-care consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or steriles is selected to eliminate antibiotic organisms in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents such as Tricklosan, which do not affect a large number of species.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed to him.
Apart from the surfactant and the skin protection agent, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, assorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator, active benzoic anti-microbial acid and other glaciers (cactus, vitamins, manthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that normal soap is as effective as anti-bacterial soap from the consumer class containing tricholusan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from hand.
The right hot water to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A purgatory or sterile hand is a material that is not water-based to clean hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol detergents sterilized through rubbing (also known as alcohol-synthetic, handwashed or hand sterilizers) began to become popular.
Most of them depend on the alcohol of isopropyl or ethanol combined with a clotting agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in glycerine, glycerine in liquid, foam for ease of use and reduction of the effect of dehydration from alcohol.
The addition of reduced hydrogen peroxide increases anti-microbial activity. Hand sterilizers containing alcohol are at least 60 to 95% effective microbicides.
Trans-fractors eliminate bacteria, multi-pharmaceutical bacteria (gold casseroles resistant to methylene and vancomesen-resistant intestinal components), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell virus, nasal virus, arc, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% of alcohol through rubbish spend 99.97% (Logarithmic decrease by 3.5, similar to a 35-minute reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after they are placed and 99.999% to 99.99% (Logarithmic decrease by 4-5) of bacteria on the hands 1 minutes after they are placed. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against the Norovirus (or Noroalak), which is the most common cause of intestinal and intestinal inflammation caused by infection. Enough manual disinfection or alcohol rubbing must be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
It rubs the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and limbs for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel drys.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand-washing be done by hand-sterilizers, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increasing use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in the elimination of microorganisms; however, they should only be an alternative to washing the right hands if water and soap are not available.
The repeated use of alcohol sterilizers can cause dehydration of the skin unless rainbows, leather moisturizers or both add to the formulation.
Alcohol ' s effect on skin drying or disposal can be reduced by adding glycerine or other rain or both to the formulation.
Clinical experiments have shown that rain-fed alcohol sterilizers cause less skin irritation and dehydration than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
Skin inflammation rarely occurs, i.e. sensational or anorexia syndrome, alcohol hypersensitization, or additives found in alcohol washing materials.
Low vulnerability to irritating skin infections has become a pull factor compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although the cleaners are not water-based, they do not purge hands of organic materials, but simply deflate them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, where pathogens remain on the hands.
The efficacy of an alcohol-free handblind is largely dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically its effect is significantly lower than that of alcohol, which depends on alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have proved to have a cumulative and continuous effect as anti-microbial after use, unlike alcohol, which has proven to be less effective after repeated use, possibly because of gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income societies cannot afford to buy soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ashes, like soap, are also a disinfectant because they form a alkaline solution when they touch water.
WHO recommended that ash or sand be used as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
Hands wet with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water be used because existing basins may be contaminated, while at the same time water temperature does not appear to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, with the back of the hands and between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of water only.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubbish creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and the rubbing removes more germs for longer periods.
Rinse well under the running water.
Riping hands inside the tub may lead to recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are thumbs, wrists, in between fingertips, and under fingernails.
Industrial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
It is often recommended that a moisturizer be used to prevent dehydration of hands, which could result in dehydration of the skin, which could increase the risk of infection.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended vessel or punching appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as "Tippi tap" and other low-cost options.
Tibby's faucet is a simple technique that uses a jug attached to a rope, and a foot control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand cleanness, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
An increasing number of research indicates that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, under the auspices of the European textile symposium on paper towels, to compare the cleaning levels provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and hand dryers with fresher jet air.
After washing their hands and drying them with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the inside of the fingers by 194% and on the palm of the hand by 254%.
The drying using the Jet Air Dehydration increased the average total number of bacteria on the inside of the fingers by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average fell by as much as 76% on the bottom of the fingers and on the palm of the hand by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of transmission to other toilet users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
Jet air dryer, which drives air out of unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of hand and device, and may infect other toilet users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 metres of the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt assessed ways of drying different hands.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after the drying of hands:
There are many different hand dryers, and I compared hand dryers with paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sterilizers is an alternative during travel due to lack of soap and water.
Alcoholics should have at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory for a long time after Hungarian doctor Aynates Simlevis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found low rates of infection using them.
Medical hand washing shall be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant quantities of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hand.
Hands must be rubbed together and fingers tangled.
If there's crap under the fingernails, a rough hair brush can be used to remove it.
Given that germs may remain in the water on both hands, it's important that they are well rinsed and dried with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of hands again from those rooftops.
The purpose of hand-washing in a health-care facility is to remove the micro-organisms that cause disease (the " germs") and to avoid their transmission.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, thereby transferring microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent, and WHO published a paper explaining how the hands were washed and rubbed in the health-care sectors.
The draft hand-cleaning guidance document submitted by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others performed a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand cleaning, if it is necessary to prove compliance with regulations.
WHO has five seconds to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before the sterilisation mission,
After taking care of patients, adding purified chemicals to soap ("medical" or anti-microbial) adds an exterminator to the hand washing agent.
This element of extermination may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are so prevalent. When "brushing" one's hands for surgery, it is necessary to provide a tap that can be operated and stopped without touching it with hands, some chlorocyclohexane or iodine wash, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile toothbrush for rubbing, and another sterile tool for cleaning under the fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing 10 minutes is not necessary.
At the rinse, the water must be prevented from returning from the forearms to the hands.
After the hand wash is finished, the hands dry with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical dress.
To limit the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use a hand disinfectant before and after caring for a sick person.
In order to control the infection of cluster splinters in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of manual disinfection came from the first 20% of laundry, and that it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand-cleaning increased to over 35%.
Normal soap-washing leads to more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases moving to food compared to antibacterial soap. By comparing hand rubs with alcohol and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol rubbing has been found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol wash hands to reduce H1N1 and hard-to-hand spores. Measures to improve hand cleaning in health-care settings may include educating employees about hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol wash, and written and oral reminders to employees.
Further research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different health-care settings.
In developing countries, it is recognized that hand-washing with soap is an essential and affordable tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to arrive at general hand-washing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can be the result of ingrained habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and change the behaviour of the population in the long term.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic revision of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in middle-income lower-class countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the promotion of hand-washing in schools is the "three-star approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to up to three stars eventually.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to effect behavioral change is the World Handwashing Day. Because of the Corona 2019-20 virus pandemic, UNICEF was encouraged to adopt an expression code to wash hands.
A few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one audit indicates that the promotion of hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
For the first time, the importance of hand-washing for human health - especially for people in critical circumstances such as mothers who have just been born or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two hand-cleaners: Hungarian doctor Agnatus Simlevis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and English English, Florence Nightingale, "The founder of modern nursing."
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was caused by the stench called Myasmaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote clean hands more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the Coveed-19 pandemic in 2020 have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing "the right ways to wash hands" were placed next to the hand washing docks in public toilets and in office and airport toilets in Germany.
"Handwashing" means something to announce that one does not want to take responsibility for something or participate in it.
It stems from a Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the hard decision of Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with a much wider use in some English societies.
In Macbeth Shakespeare's play, Ms. Macbeth starts to wash her hands too much in an attempt to purge a fantasy spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and those that she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that, after referring to immoral acts or thinking about them, people tend to wash hands more than others, and tend to value hand washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
The washing of hands, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand-washing ritual that has emerged in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Tefleh, Jewish hand-washing, Christianity, and Islam. Religions also impose healthy hand-washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after the use of the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose washing of hands before and after each meal.
Risk control controls for Koved-19 in the workplace
Occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control for the prevention of Corona 2019 virus (Coved-19) are the risk control controls in the workplace.
Proper workplace risk management controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the risk of illness in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be exposed to a C-19.
According to the United States Department of Occupational Safety and Health (USHA), low-risk jobs involve minimum contact with the public and other coworkers, a situation in which basic procedures for preventing infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the morals of coughing and sneezing, and maintaining normal practices for cleaning and cleaning the work environment.
Posts with intermediate exposure risks include those requiring frequent or close contact with individuals unknown or suspected of having been infected with Caved 19, but may be infected by constant transmission in the community or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the general public as in schools, high labour-intensive working environments, and some large retail places.
Risk control controls for this group, in addition to the basic procedures for preventing infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers and the use of personal protective equipment available for dealing with a person with Caved-19.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health considers health-care workers and the mortuary of the dead who are exposed to a known Caved 19 or a suspect to high levels of exposure risk, which increases the risk of extremely high exposure if the workers are carrying out procedures for the generation of aerosols, collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected Caved 19.
Appropriate risk control controls for these personnel include engineering controls such as passive-pressure ventilation rooms and functionally appropriate personal protective equipment.
Koved-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to take care of others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods required and the ways in which they are obtained (e.g., shopping in non-peak hours or through delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from heavily affected geographical areas of Coved-19 may cease. The preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors from home and community places, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Establishes the necessary controls to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Plans for preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing staff transmission, protecting those most at risk of negative health complications, maintaining business processes and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which commercial activity occurs affects the responses taken.
The Hierarchy of risk control controls is a widely used framework for occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Given that it is not possible to eliminate Koved-19 ' s risks, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating staff from work-related risks without relying on workers ' behaviour, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PBE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the risk to the worker, proper suitability as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and proper wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, removal, cleaning and storage, or proper disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Department (U.S.H.A.), jobs involving lower risk exposure involve minimum contact with the public and other work colleagues.
The basic procedures for the prevention of infection recommended to all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the morals of coughing and sneezing, including covering the mouth and nose at coughing and sneezing, providing paper napkins and garbage canisters, preparing for telework or organizing shifts in succession if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people ' s tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that personnel suffering from acute respiratory diseases remain at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms are removed for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-pharmaceuticals or other drugs that improve symptoms, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that staff be aware of these policies.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health, positions with an intermediate risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals unknown or suspected to be infected with Coffid 19, but may be infected by the continuous transmission of infection in the surrounding community or by the recent international travel to a site where Coved-19 is prevalent.
Engineering controls include the installation of highly qualified air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezes, the installation of service windows for customers shopping without leaving the car. Administrative controls include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings face-to-face with virtual contacts, the establishment of organized shifts in succession, the suspension of unnecessary travel to locations where there are ongoing outbreaks of Cade-19, the development of emergency communication plans including a forum to respond to workers ' concerns, the provision of updated education and training to workers on risk factors and preventive behaviour related to Caved-19, the training of workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment on how to use them, the provision of resources and a working environment that encourages personal hygiene, requiring regular hand-washing, limiting the access of clients and the public to the work site, the dissemination of signs on hand-washing and other protective measures related to Caved-19.
People in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes sick while on a plane, appropriate protective controls to protect other workers and passengers include the removal of sick passengers from others by 6 feet, the assignment of one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, the provision of a face mask to the sick person or the requirement of the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper napkins at cough or sneeze.
The crew must wear medical gloves that can be disposed of when dealing with a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger suffers from fever, constant coughing or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other purposes that can be disposed of in the biohazard protective bag must be disposed of, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and then sterilized. For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include deferred travel upon illness, self-segregation and immediate notification of the medical centre on board if a person is infected with fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure of clean-up or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the prevalence in the community.
When there is a limit to the transmission of infection in society ranging from limited to average, social separation strategies such as cancellation of field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education, band or meal lessons in the cafeteria, increasing inter-office distances, organizing successive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to strategies for social dispersion, school departures can be taken into account. For law enforcement officials who carry out routine daily activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or are suspected of having suffered Caved 19 are advised to follow the same guidance as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and clear work belts and tools before reusing them using spray or domestic cleaning mop, and follow standard operating procedures to deal with pollution and dispose of personal protective equipment used and collect and wash clothes.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health considers that some health-care workers and the remains ' wallet fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health-care personnel, support, laboratories and medical transport who are exposed to known or suspected patients in Caved-19.
These become extremely high risk levels if personnel perform procedures for the generation of aerosols, as well as for the collection or handling of samples from patients confirmed or suspected to be infected with Caved-19.
Procedures for the generation of aerosols include intubation, cough-inducing procedures, retrospectives, certain dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The mortuary functions of high-risk corpses include workers who participate in the preparation of the bodies of confirmed or suspected Caved 19 at the time of their death; they become highly exposed if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls of these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected Caved 19 patients, including in the implementation of aerosol generation procedures.
Ventilation with specialized negative pressure may be appropriate in some health-care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO) recommends that patients arriving in separate waiting areas be isolated on the basis of whether they are suspected of having Caved 19 or not. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Department recommends the use of respirators for those working at a distance of 6 feet of known or suspected patients in Sars-Coff-2 and those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with a N95 candidate, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory protection programme, which includes installation and suitability testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve workers' comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of aprons, because Coffid 19 is a respiratory disease rather than a body fluid transmission.
Only WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask for examination staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect breathing samples from Coved-19 patients, or take care of them, or transport them without any procedures to generate aerosols, the World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical mask, protective glasses, facial protection, mirage and gloves.
If the procedure for the generation of aerosols is implemented, the face mask is replaced by the breath mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of personal protection equipment is inadequate, WHO recommends that the need for personal protective equipment be reduced through telemedicine and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with a Coved-19 patient, using personal protective equipment only for the specific task, continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discouraging the use of masks for individuals without symptoms.

We found ourselves in extraordinary circumstances this month.
The Coffid epidemic has become 19 things that clearly demonstrate global human interdependence and our responsibilities to others.
Our history has seen no similar challenges at all, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global sympathy, cooperation and community-building, which are at the heart of this institution.
The strong friendship and care that we have witnessed among all our colleagues through e-mails, calls and conversations is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human emotions that, fortunately, surround the way we work.
I am very grateful and deeply proud to have you as true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of the critical importance of the world ' s ability to move towards Wikipedia at the present time, and the powerful symbolicism demonstrated by the fact that this critical resource remains available online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether through the continued operation of the sites, the payment of salaries to our colleagues, or the safety of our communities.
The world is desperately in need of the information available in Wikipedia more than ever before.
It is a moment when the world has a positive impact not only on our efforts, but also on the way it is done.
Because of the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make great adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Amendments to working methods and timetables
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our way and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that debate, we considered what we felt could be the appropriate response to what we face, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the Foundation ' s work during this period.
We wanted with great enthusiasm to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that's fine.
All employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not about to announce a holiday, and if you're able to work longer than normal hours, you might add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get goods from groceries or go to a doctor, your safety is our most important priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we certainly remember it.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, but you must inform your manager and assist your team in reviewing calendars and timetables to ensure coverage of key areas of work.
(If you are positively diagnosed with Coved-19, please inform Brian in the Department of Training and Certificates so that the Department of Training and Certificates can assist by providing support and ensuring that your case receives appropriate care from the Department.
Colleagues working an hour receive full wages.
We have already mentioned that, and we renew this pledge of our commitments to our contractors and colleagues working on the clock.
Every employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many individuals are using work to overcome the pressures that are spreading around us in the world.
What we can do will be productive in an amazing way, especially during such difficult times.
Again, it's about taking care of one's own.
We only ask you to contact your boss so he can figure out what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some actions are necessary.
There are also some things that we must maintain.
Site reliability engineering teams, human resources operations, trust, trust and fund-raising (and others) are doing very important work, which may require further support.
We will initiate a process in cooperation with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There's a lot of work to be done by all of us, and we're just gonna focus on the most important projects.
Going slower now, won't hurt us later.
We don't plan on doubling work time to fix what's missing after the pandemic's over.
We're not expected to work extra hours to meet the unrealistic deadlines that I've experienced right now.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables once that is appropriate.
What's going on in APP's annual planning?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of day-to-day working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual 2020-2021 planning.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow us more time to design the budget to allow staff to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while reconciling those who need or want to work within a reduced work-hour schedule within the next few weeks.
This extension of the timetable will reduce the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Governing Council next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco might have been infected with the Coved-19 virus.
However, as a result of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired an antiviral clean-up team to clear all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
The team used HVS to cleanse all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our own floor.
The building applied its duty of care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is properly ready until we decide to get back to work.
Our office in Washington D.C. is located in a WeRock building, which we participated in its Coveed-19 protocol and with all the members of our working group at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Starting last week, our office in Washington D.C. moved to a completely remote location under the joint direction of our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions continue but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-term colleagues know that it may have been an amendment, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or an incremental increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consideration should be given to how to divide them over a period of several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared and reading materials sent forward.
Video should be the default solution, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, and one person should observe the conversation to identify questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to assist in taking notes (or implement the collaborative note-taking process).
An e-mail should be sent to technical support when comfortable headphones are required.
The health and safety compensation programme can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.

The HR Operations Group is looking for guidance for user-friendly online meeting elements, to support the increase in work distributed across our organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of Web Editors Editathon, until the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these objectives.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidance related to Puechemidia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiments of the world community are between grief caused by turmoil, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities and Wikimedia, among others.
In the light of the progress made in these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide community space to monitor impact and follow up on all contacts with it.
Keeping abreast of topics related to Coved-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 7:00 Pacific time for the Working Group meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with us.
We are engaged in this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this e-mail, and all other necessary information regarding Coffid 19 available in Ovis Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up to date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers residing in highly affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with the Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Brian Gooden, Director of International Global Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work or obligations.
Instead, it is a realization at this moment that our work and commitments are likely to need to adapt to the situation in a way that we have not in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our workers with the support they need, and provide the world with the service on which they depend.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes to complete it.
Now, it is time for everyone to help each other and to create a space for the important work that comes in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to achieve this, so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, Director, Crisis Response Team (Amanda Kay, Amy V, Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S.) and other members of the Command Team (Grant Aye, Heather W., Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M. and Toby N).
The enzyme transgenic 2 (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in the lung, arteries, heart and kidney, as well as the intestines.
The enzyme transformer of nijutencin 2 counters the work of the enzyme transgenic (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotencin 2 and increasing angiotencin (1-7); making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases; and also bringing some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haACE2.
The enzyme transformer of angiotensine 2 is defined as a metallic enzyme containing zinc element and located on the surface of the blanket cells and other cells.
An enzyme transformer protein 2 contains a peptidaz M2 range with an amino tip, and a colictrini carboxyly tip chain with kidney amino acids.
The enzyme transgenic 2 is a type 1 single-transmitter membrane protein, with active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer part of the cell of the enzyme transgenic 2 is separated from the membrane by an enzyme called Shedaz, resulting in a soluble protein being released into the bloodstream and then released through urine.
The enzyme transforming angiotensine 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 cells in the lung, intestinal microcells, blanket cells of arteries and veins, as well as in muscle cells with an arterial walls in most organs.
The DNA of the enzyme transgenic 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the schematic, sub-thill area, and the brain stem.
The basic function of the enzyme transgenic 2 is to act as a balance sheet for the enzyme transgenic.
The enzyme transforming angiotencin stimulates the transformation of angiotencine 1 hormone into angiotencine 2 capsules.
On the other hand, the enzyme transforming angiotencin 2 separates the carboxili end containing amino acid phenylallanin from the angiotencin 2 (aspartite-argen-valen-terosin-isoline-histedine-prolene-vinylalalalalanin) and analyses it to Angiotencin (1-7), (estedin-espartite-argen-valen-taerosin-esoleusin-histeddin-prolene-vinylalalallanin).
The enzyme transforming angiotencin 2 is separated from a number of other peptides, including [dis-Argenin9] - Pradrikinin, Abilene, Neurotencin, Dinorphine A and Grillin.
The enzyme transgenic 2 also organizes the membrane passage of a neutral SLC6A19 amino acid transmitter, and has a role in Hartnap's disease.
As a protein through my membrane, an enzyme transformer of angiotencin 2 is the main cell entry for some corona virus, which includes the human virus NL63, SARS Cove (the virus causing the sars) and SARS Cove-2 (the virus causing the Coved-19 disease).
In particular, the connection of S1-Stein Spike to SARS Cove and SARS Cove-2 with the enzyme range of the enzyme transgenic 2 on the cell surface leads to cellular retaliation and transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles in the cells.
This input process needs to set up a S protein with a protease enzyme through the membrane, the host's seren 2, which is still being tested as a possible treatment. This makes it assumed that lowering the levels of the enzyme transgenic 2 in cells may help to resist infection.
In any case, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend the continued use of the usual enzyme-transmitting inhibitors of the nipotentin, and the enviotin receptors blockade as a cure.
A methodological study and a follow-up analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of enzyme-transmitting inhibitors for enzymes was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference set."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia has decreased among those infected with enzyme-transmitted inhibitors and those at greater risk of pneumonia, especially those suffering from stroke or heart failure.
The use of enzyme-transmitting inhibitors has led to a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results have been less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that the mutant human enzyme (rhACE2) will be a new treatment for acute lung injuries. It has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute respiratory syndrome induced by a variety of fatty diabetes.
The combined half-life of the enzyme transgenic 2 is approximately 10 hours, while its work starts in 30 minutes, in addition to its continued effectiveness (time period) up to 24 hours.
There are many indications that the combined enzyme of angiotencin 2 may be a promising cure for those suffering from the inactivity of traditional angiotencin (RAS) resonance system inhibitors, and in diseases associated with an antijutencin 2 in blood. Clinical experiments are being evaluated, about the effect of the mitigated enzyme of angiotencin 2 on the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
Coffid-19 applications are specially designed portable device software applications to help track people involved in the response to the Corona 2019-20 virus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying persons ("mixtures") who may have engaged an infected person.
Several applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and areas of jurisdiction.
Many frameworks have been developed to design applications to track mixtures.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that depend on the geographical location of users of applications.
Less privacy alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they might integrate a function that would support these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and IOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alipay, published an application that allows citizens to check whether or not they've mixed up people with Caved 19.
It's an application used by individuals in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an application called TraceTogether.
The application was designed by a local information technology association and issued as an open-source application and is to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona," an application based on the use of Bluetooth to track exposure to the association of potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to health-care authorities.
The Ministry of Communication and Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, designed the application.
On April 14, 2020, the application was still awaiting the adoption of Google Play and App Store of Apple.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the Mixture Tracking Application was in the advanced stage of development and could be available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application, "StopCovid."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing applications based on the TraceTogether application launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Trace Protocol. Russia intends to introduce an application using the virtual geographic perimeter of patients diagnosed by doctors with cavity 19 from Moscow residents, designed to ensure that they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if applications were used only for a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Corona virus" applications, Apple imposed restrictions on the types of organisations that could add Korona-related applications to its application store; this was limited to "official" or other organizations of good reputation only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Proponents of privacy have expressed concerns about the consequences of collective surveillance resulting from the use of the Corona virus applications, particularly as regards whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the Corona virus pandemic will be eliminated immediately after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Control should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and control should include clauses regarding the timing of their suspension;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of Caved-19;
Data security and identity confidentiality should be protected and established on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with outside parties should be specified in the law;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens ' rights should be available to address abuses;
The "effective participation" of all relevant "stakeholders," including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Greenzen (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the hardware operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used web-based tracking rather than applications, eliminating both the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions with access to primary site data, however, have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all central server systems need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been established that use central servers only for infocommunications (see section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to implement a combination tracking process.
Instead of using an ad hoc application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including portable tracking data and card transaction data, and includes such data to send notices via text messages to potential infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential mixtures, the Government has also made site information publicly available, which has been made possible by the wide-ranging changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Corona virus causing Middle East respiratory syndrome in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered the use of both centralized and privacy systems.
On April 6, 2020, the details of this matter have yet to be released.
The pursuit of privacy by privileged mixtures is an applied and successful concept supported by strong research literature dating from at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to find solutions compatible with privacy, such as low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BBCT has been a coordinating effort with both centralized and decentralized approaches, rather than an individual protocol. Decentralization-based protocols include tracking decentralized, private proximity (DPP/DPT-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as CNN), sensitive protocols to privacy, mechanisms for tracking mixtures via mobile devices (BAT) and others.
In these protocols, personal identification data do not leave the device, and all reconciliations occur on the device.
The MIT Media Lab privacy group was working on the development of SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy techniques when collecting site data or intersecting routes and using them to track the spread of Kaved-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report "The Evil Face of Applications: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Pandemic."
SafeTrace uses secure devices techniques to allow users to share sensitive site and health data with users and other officials without compromising the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, a global focal point tracking coalition was established by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interchange between tracking and alert applications, a key feature of achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had made the Blue Tres Protocol, which was used by the Government ' s official application, open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and IOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track mixtures; they claimed that they would maintain privacy by combining low-energy Bluetooth technology with privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to introduce the system in three stages:
Introduction of tools to enable governments to create formal, private applications to track the Corona virus
This function is directly integrated into the Android and IOS system and Google and Apple are planning to solve the problems of continuous use and control by distributing systems first through the upgrades of operating systems and then by removing them in the same way as the threat ends.
The re-establishment of the drug (also known as reuse, reallocation, change of purpose or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is the redefinition of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than originally designed to treat it.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for Coved-19.
Other research trends include the development of Coved-19 vaccine and the transport of fine plasma. The SARS Cove-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treated proteins, each containing multiple-coast sites.
Analysis of these sites provides the reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that destroys Coffid-19 proteins.
Among the highly important protein targets of SARS Cove-2 are pope-like protease, RNA-based polymerase, helikas, protein S, and repo phosphas for diphosphate.
Hüseyin A.A. et al. studied several candidate compounds that were subsequently improved and analysed because of the similarity of their structure with approved drugs with the highest similarity. This was intended to accelerate the development of a strong SARS Cove-2 drug in its pre-bed study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
chloroquine is the antimalarial drug that doctors also use to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, a World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxylchloroquine could be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical solidarity experiment.
New York Governor Andrew Como announced that New York state experiments on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could start on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of chloroquine sulfate and chlorophyta under the emergency use licence (EUA).
Treatment through clinical trials was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and was licensed under the emergency use licence only as an emergency emergency treatment for patients who entered the hospital but could not receive treatment in the clinical trial.
CDC has declared that "the use of chlorocyclohexane to prevent or treat SARS Coff-2 infection, doses or duration has not yet been determined."
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York ' s Langon College of Medicine is experimenting with the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxylchloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shengen claimed that Fafeberavir was "clearly effective."
Of the 35 patients in Schengen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the sickness period was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half of them were given Fafeberavir and the other half received Umifenofir.
The Italian Drug Agency has alerted people that the existing evidence in support of the drug is incomplete and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include its reserve stock, and that the army would use it to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat Kaved-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Journal, Shinzo Abe had preliminary discussions with the Trump Administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in treating the most acute cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to be pregnant.
One of the studies using Lupinavir/Ritonavir (Caltra), a combination of the Lupinavir and Ritonavir antivirus collector, stated that the results "did not detect any benefit."
Drugs were designed to discourage HIV from being copied by linking it to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to adjust drugs to a compound linked to Proteaz Sars Cove-2. The scientific community is witnessing a state of criticism about redirecting resources to redefining drug purposes specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lupinavir/Ritunaver to the international solidarity experiment.
Gillyad Sciences has developed Remedisever as a cure for Ebola and Marburg virus infection. Gillyad Sciences later discovered that Reddisevere has antiviral activity in the lab against many nematode viruses, mucous viruses, and Corona viruses.
One of the problems with antiretroviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
According to some early pre-bed studies, remedicifer may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several current clinical trials, including two at the University of Cleveland hospitals; one revolves around people with moderate disease, and the other is for patients with the most acute disease.
There are three clinical trials on vitamin C antivirals for patients who have been hospitalized and suffer from acute illness due to Coved-19, as well as two trials that are controlled by the use of phantom medicine (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began experiments on the impact of antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical experiment on the use of the Teijin-produced Alvisco (Siclisonid), an inhalant corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat patients with the new Corona virus before symptoms arise.
A phase II experiment is currently being conducted using a form of enzyme transmuted to enzymes 2 over 200 patients who are required to join the experience of acute cases that have been hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute of Canada are currently studying the role of Colchicin in reducing infection and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of Caved-19.
The study, known as Kolkoruna, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with cavity 19 and suffered from minor symptoms without having to go to hospital.
Pregnant women, breast-feeding women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not qualified.
Many anticoagulants are also tested in Italy.
Currently, low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multi-centre study was announced in Italy for 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium inoxaparin with doses of disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS Cove-2 is a virus, great scientific attention has focused on the reuse of antiretroviral drugs designed to deal with past outbreaks such as Mars, SARS and West Nile.
Rebaverin: Specialists recommended that Rebaverin be used to treat Coved-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese directive.
Omifenoffer: Specialists recommended that Omphenoffer be used to treat Koved-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Directive.
Some antibiotics identified by specialists include the possibility of reusable them as treatments for Coved-19:
Tessilizomab (receiver of Interloquin 6): accredited by China.
The experiments are in Italy and China as well. See Tusilizomap, Coved-19.
Coved-19 is supposed to be a vaccine against the corona virus disease 2019 (Coved-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, numerous attempts are under way to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect to have a vaccine against SARS-Coff-2, the cause virus, in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
Coffid 19 was identified in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak spread in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-KOV-2.
The requirements of the pandemic preparedness initiative launched in April are speed, industrialization, wide dissemination and global access.
In April, scientists from the pandemic preparedness innovation coalition reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against Koffid-19.
The main objectives of the Platform, which have advanced to the first phase of safety studies, include:
DNA (oxygen-deficit repose DNA and repuzie DNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, type 5 gland virus transmitter)
According to scientists of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79 according to the Milkin Institute) and 37 others announced, but with little public information (presumably at the planning stage or being designed).
The first and second phase experiment conducts an initial safety and admissibility test, usually random, controlled by omission, and in multiple locations, with more precise and effective doses.
Phase III experiments typically involve more participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine effectiveness test to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (as confirmed as early as April 2020), 74 were not yet under human assessment (still under consideration "before bed").
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the probability of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the VIDO-InterVac Centre at Saskatchewan University announced the launch of a vaccine, which is intended to start testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Jansen Pharmaceuticals, led by Haniki Schweitmecker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.

In developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for pre-bed tests and a first-stage clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the acceleration of work it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported that it was a major development similar to the Corona virus with partial funding from the Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with human testing plans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian stated that United States President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the Koffid-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a DNA-based vaccine.
The DNA-based vaccine filtered BNT162 is currently undergoing pre-bed testing with clinical trials expected to commence in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive pre-bed test results in April 2020 and that the vaccine, the final candidate, could start testing in humans by autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations (CIPA) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a Kufaid-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pastor Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which pushed the total investment of the Alliance of Pandemic Preparedness Innovations in the development of the Koffid-19 vaccine to US$ 29 million.
The partners of the Coalition for Pandemic Preparedness Innovations for the Development of the Coved-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different candidate vaccines.
The researchers at the Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-magnifying Rebuzi DNA vaccine for Coved-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 research projects on medical measures against Coved-19, including several candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government has announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the Koved-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "valve bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another outbreak of the Corona virus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on tests of PittCoVacc, the potential vaccine for Coffid 19 in mice, where they stated that "the S1 subunit vaccines for Sars-Coff-2 given micron needles triggered strong responses to specific antibodies [in mice] that were visible from 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the College of Pharmacy at Waterloo University announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a potential nose spray.
With the use of moths, oxygen-deficient repose DNA will be designed to reincarnate within human bacteria to produce HIV-like harmless particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce SARS-Coff-2 antibodies.
In March 2020, the United States Government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access giant computers from IBM, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called unspecified effects.
That means she can have benefits beyond the disease she's fighting.
Another random experience in Australia seeks to register 4,170 health-care workers.
The vaccines being developed are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using models of specific animals for Coved 19, such as genetically modified rats in enzyme transgenics 2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, points to the need for level 3 biological safety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Vaccinations against SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no preventive treatment or vaccine for SARS that has proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When March spread, it was believed that existing research on SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against Mars-Koff infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on oxygen-deficient repose DNA) which completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, three other vaccines under development, all of which were virus-oriented vaccines, two gland virus-guided vaccines (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications raised the conspiracy theory that the virus causing Coffide-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in numerous social media publications refer to existing genetic sequence patents and vaccines for other types of Corona viruses such as the Sars Corona virus.
Corona 2019 (Coved-19) is a disease caused by the Corona 2 virus associated with SARS (SARS Cove-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include exhaustion, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat inflammation, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show slight symptoms, some evolve into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported to have been injured in 210 States and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during mixing, mostly by spray scattered at coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When spray is dispersed during exhalation, it usually falls on the ground or on the roof instead of being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, their noses, or their mouths.
The virus can survive on rooftops for 72 hours.
It is more contagious in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before the symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the chain polymer reaction of the instant reverses through a nostril osteoporosis swab.
It is recommended that masks be used for those suspected of HIV infection and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending that they not be used, some considering otherwise, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for Coved-19.
The transmission of the disease was reported at the local level in most countries in all six WHO regions.
There may be no symptoms for people living with HIV or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, exhaustion and respiratory distress.
Immediate medical care is recommended if emergency symptoms of breathing difficulties, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty in waking up, blue face or lips arise.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nose nose or throat infection may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system have been observed, such as nausea, vomit and diarrhea in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered only from chest cramps and bouts.
In some, the disease may evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called custody.
The period of custody for Coved-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5% of the infection. Reports indicate that symptoms may not appear on all infected.
The role of carriers has not yet been fully recognized without symptoms in the transmission of the disease; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they are likely to contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people without symptoms is currently unknown and is under study. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms while in hospital.
China ' s National Health Committee began to include non-symptomatic cases in the daily intake on 1 April; of 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) of those cases did not show symptoms at the test.
Pyramid and saliva can carry large proportions of the virus.
Talking louder results in more spray than talking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that cough without a mouth cover could lead to spraying up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted through bioaerobic aerosols, and the screening of samples of air complexes in the lobby outside individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral DNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may trigger respiratory release in the form of spray, thereby spreading the virus through air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, it is believed that the risk is limited. The virus is more contagious when people suffer from symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms arise, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about the ease of spread of the disease, one person can count from two to three more in general. The virus remains stuck on the surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to exist for one day on cardboard and up to three days on polypropylene and rust-resistant steel (ASIS 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soap and disinfectants are also effective on condition that they are properly used; soap melts and shuts down the virus ' s protective adipose membrane, as well as ridsing the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chloride (surgent disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
The Corona 2 virus associated with SARS (SARS Cove 2) is a novel Corona virus associated with SARS, where three people suffering from pneumonia were first isolated from the Wuhan acute respiratory disease cluster.
The new SARS Cove-2 virus shares its characteristics with the relevant Corona viruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap kills the virus, destroying its protective membrane.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by Coved-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the enzyme transgenic 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the second type of skeletal cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glacial protein called Spike to contact ACI2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the injured people who entered hospital in Wuhan, China, suffered severe heart attacks, and were more common in critical situations.
Symptoms associated with the heart and the vascular are high, due to systemic respiratory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute cardiac muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and share in the performance of its functions.
The rate of clot (31%) and vascular clots (25%) has increased among patients in the ICU with Caved-19, which may be associated with a poor prediction of pathology. The autopsy of individuals who died of Coved-19 was found, with an inflammation of intra-pneumonic lymph cells.
Although SARS-Koff-2 has been directed towards ACI2 epithelial cells in the respiratory system, severe Coved-19 patients suffer from symptoms of hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been found that the T cells that release the pathogen GM-CSF are associated with bringing in the only cells that release Interloquin 6 that cause infection and hyperpulmonary diseases in Coved-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a lymphocytosis at the autopsy.
WHO has published several disease testing protocols.
RRTCR is the standard test method.
The test is usually conducted using respiratory samples from a nostril osteoporosis swab; however, a nasal or a mine sample can also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but that requires two blood samples to be taken by two weeks and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the Corona virus and spread gene sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop PCR tests to detect HIV infection.
On April 4, 2020, tests of antibodies (which may detect active infection and whether or not the person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed that accuracy is only 60-70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidance issued by the Choongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The two-sided, multi-slapping glass amplifiers with an ocean spread and asymmetric, and left a common feature at the beginning of the infection.
A spread under my side, a stone shaking form (sweet barrier fish with uneven shovels) and a merger with the disease's evolution.
There are few data available on the micropharmacological and pathological pests of Coved-19.
Main satisfactory findings from the autopsy:
Microscopic examination: pneumococcus, pericarditis, lung inflammation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypercouple, large, not typical snip cells, and inflammation through me with a lymphocyte and multi-nucleic giant cells.
Acute pneumonia: Snake damage is widespread (DAD) with widespread osteoporosis.
The widespread skeletal damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Pneumonia therapy: regulation of excretions in skeletal cavities and cellular pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intracranial coagulation (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, exercising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin at coughing or sneezing, and recommends the use of the inner part of the annex if no napkin is available.
It's recommended that the hands be cleaned well after any cough or sneeze.
CDC recommended the use of cloth facial caps in public places, aiming in part at reducing the transmission of non-motivated infections. Social spacing strategies aim at reducing the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and abolishing large public gatherings.
Diverging instructions also include at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
Since no vaccine was expected to be invented until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling Koveed-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic's peak, which is known as the "top of the curve."
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, after cleaning the nose, cough or sneezing.
Also recommends the use of at least 60% alcohol-containing hand sterilizers, where soap and water are not available only. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
Anti-microbial activity arises in these formulations of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand-purging substance."
Add glycerol as moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support and other organ support affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of HIV-positive wear a simple face mask.
The membrane oxygen is used outside the body (EMO) to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under study.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Committee have published recommendations for the care of those who have been hospitalized because of Koved-19.
Intensive care specialists and lung specialists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, the online critical care book.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment available for Coffid 19.
For symptoms, some specialist doctors recommend the use of paracetamol (asetaminovin) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
The necessary precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of HIV transmission, especially in health-care settings, when implementing actions that may result in spray, such as intubation or manual respiration.
For health-care specialists who care for Coved-19 patients, CDC recommends that the person be placed in the airborne isolation room in addition to standard precautions, mixing precautions and evaporation-borne disease precautions. CDC explains the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PBE) during the pandemic.
Recommended tools: Personal protective equipment aprons, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial installations, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the EUA emergency licence.
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends that facial protections or homemade masks be used as the last solution.
Coffid-19's most cases aren't so degraded that they require industrial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to persons suffering from respiratory failure associated with Coved-19 for hospital patients is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using high-flow nasal canal or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options is of the same benefit to those suffering from a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue to use gas respiration when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared with high-flow nasal channel. Critical cases are more frequent among older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden rise in the number of high-risk cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were entered into ICUs, 2.3% required industrial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of those who were hospitalized because of Kaufed-19 eventually enter ICUs.
Industrial respiration becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among people with Caved-19 and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control and high positive excretive pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing lung injury risks associated with the respiratory and thoracic respirator.
High positive exhalation pressure may not be available in old respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antivirals are in clinical trials.
Looks like Reddissevere's the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested for those with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that volunteers participate in experiences of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary licence to use recovery plasma as a trial therapy in cases where a person ' s life is seriously or directly threatened.
He has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that he is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone application to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter the name and identity number.
The application can detect 'mixtures ' using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-sanitary quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Massive data analyses of mobile phone data, facial recognition techniques, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected and mixed people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data for those presumed to be infected with the Corona virus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantine and protect those likely to be in contact with injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data on telephone sites collected with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Mr. Julio Gallera, stated that the mobile phone companies had informed him that "40% of the people were still moving everywhere."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend of Hakathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Kaliuliade, also extended a global invitation to present innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the Corona virus.
Individuals may feel distress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
BBC published Rory O'Connor's saying that "increasing social isolation, unity, health concerns, tension and economic stagnation is a massive storm that harms people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a light cycle with minor or no symptoms, as it is similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as colds.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to be severely infected with Coved-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as Sars and Merce, but there is still a lack of data for Coved-19. Coved-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
Coffid 19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, stun shock or multi-organic failure.
The complications associated with Coved-19 are stunting, an abnormal clot of blood, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Six percent of people with Coved-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with hemorrhagic abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% were diagnosed with kidney malfunctions.
Approximately 20-30% of Coved-19 patients showed a rise in liver enzyme levels (amine vectors).
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 were in the hospital.
However, the average period between hospitalization and death for those transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In an early case study, the average period from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, reaching a total of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate of men was 2.8% while that of women was 1.7%.
Post-mortem pathology tests of lung samples show widespread osteoporosis with cellular peroxide excretions in both lungs.
The changes in viral cell disease have been observed in the skeletal cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths declared by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those taken to hospital suffered from previous cases of illness. The availability of medical resources and the region ' s socio-economic status may also affect deaths.
Estimates of deaths resulting from the situation vary as a result of differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A incomplete inventory of minor cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that previous injuries have been caused may suggest that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from severe symptoms of Coved-19 and 2.4 times more in need of intensive care and death than non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity among some of the patients recovering from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage.
It could also cause post-impairment intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it has not been known whether or not the previous infection is gaining effective and long-term immunity from the disease.
The acquisition of immunity is seen as possible, based on the behaviour of other Corona viruses, but it has been announced that there were cases of recovery from Caved-19 and then re-infected.
These cases are believed to be more frequent if the infection continues than if it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and has animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely the result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of cavity 19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 was the first date of symptoms.
According to official WHO publications, 8 December 2019 was the first date of symptoms.
Many actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region over time and are influenced by the size of examinations, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options, the time taken since the onset of the disease and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health.
In late 2019, in the 10th revision of the International Classification of Emergency Diseases (ICCD), WHO allocated U 07.1 deaths from SARS Cove-2 confirmed lab infection and Code U07.2 diagnosed deaths from SARS Coff-2 clinically or epidemiologically without confirming the infection. The rate of deaths from injuries reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have been found infected and died of a disease, and the rate of infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those who have been infected (who have been found and who have not been found) and those who have died of a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from injury until the fate of the situation is known.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all injured, their presence may provide information on the number of injured.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castellioni de Ada, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7%) have already died.
In Jangil, the disease spread because of carnival festivals, and moved to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all of Coved-19's deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, I may have about 3% antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed to have died of Coffid 19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate differ between men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women disappearing at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, the non-proliferation of smoking among women and the simultaneous morbidity of men, such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women, may have contributed to a higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men and 72% of those who died because of Caved-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for Koved-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and their risk of HIV infection increases.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the official name of the disease was "Coffid 19."
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Gibresus, explained that Ko is short for the word Corona, and in a short for an HIV virus, 19 refers to the first year of outbreak detection: December 31, 2019.
The name was selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in line with the international recommendations for designation aimed at preventing stigmatization. It is called the virus that causes Koffid-19 with the Corona 2 virus associated with SARS (SARS Cove-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the terms "Coffid 19 virus" and "the virus responsible for Coffid 19" in public statements.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the Corona virus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the Corona virus and the Corona Wuhan virus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the names of the new Corona virus - 2019 and the acute respiratory disease associated with the new Corona virus - 2019 be used as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 guidance that prohibits the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names Koved-19 and Sars Cove-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capabilities in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export health-care materials such as nose wipes and breathing devices.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local start-up company counter-engineered it and released the 100 valves required in one night.
After the first outbreak of Coved-19, conspiracy theories and false information emerged with regard to the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread over the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the spread of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and researchers in the industry conduct international research on vaccines and medicines for Coved-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the "Solidarity Experience" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antivirals with the most promising effectiveness.
No vaccine is available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS Cove are used because it's like SARS Cove-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, researchers aim to create a full-blown vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection in Caved-19.
The second strategy, a micro-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that will make the immune system sensitive to some micro-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS Cove-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (dynamic or repuzie DNA vaccines, a new vaccine innovation technique).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was initiated on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-based pride was referred to as a potential challenge for SARS Cove-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials under way starting in April 2020.
Seven experiments have been evaluated for treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxylchloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed re-use of antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of the new disease is the majority of Chinese research, through nine phase III experiments on Reddissevere across several countries, the results of which are scheduled to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and potential Koffid-19 was carried out as of April 2020. Many existing antiviral properties for the treatment of Koffid-19 are being evaluated, including remedicever, chloroquine, hydroxylchloroquine, lobenavir/retonaver and lobinavir/tunaver integrated with interferon beta.
There's preliminary evidence of remedicevir's effectiveness, as of March 2020.
A clinical improvement has been observed among patients treated with remedicevir for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. chloroquine, previously used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan HIV Research Institute points out that although a single gram dose is recommended, twice the dose is extremely dangerous and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency licence for chloroquine and chloroquine, according to the estimate of doctors treating those suffering from Coffid 19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, repavirin or amphinovir for use in the treatment of Coffid 19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of repavirin are necessary to discourage SARS Cove-2 in the laboratory.
It was recommended that further study be undertaken of the effect of Netazoxanid on organisms after demonstrating its inhibition of the low concentration of Sars Cove-2. Studies have shown that the initial preparation of Spike protein via the trans-membrane circulatory protease (TCRS2) is necessary to enter SARS Cove-2 through interaction with the future of ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromicin present significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir Sars Cove-2 is not discouraged in the laboratory and has no known role in Coffid-19's treatment.
The cytokin storm may be one of the complications in the late stages of Caved-19 sharp.
There is evidence that chlorocyclohexane may have anti-sytokine properties. The Chinese National Health Committee added Tusilizomab to the treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
