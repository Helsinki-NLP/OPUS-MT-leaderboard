Professor called 911 and confessed to killing his girlfriend.
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police should come home, only a little shaky.
Lamb said his "cute dog" is alive and probably upset and that her parents' phones could be found on her cell phone.
The police found Amy Prentiss' lifeless body and a handwritten note in a white notebook: "I wish I could turn everything back, I loved Amy very much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," said the officers.
There was no evidence that Lamb, a two-online teacher for Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus where police loved history professor Ethan Scmidt was shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Police chief Lynn Buford at Delta State University said college officials heard shots at 10: 18.
Lamb also said that he made the call to the Revolutionary 911 shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide when the police approached him.
The day after the school shooting led students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do that.
On both sides of the state, the details of students and staff who know about him, as well as the investigators, were drawn by a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal record.
In fact, Schmidt mentioned in a book he wrote as one of the great people he shared his academic life with Lamb.
They both taught in Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students learned from both.
However, there were signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who praised Lamb, also said that he was a concerned and nervous person and looked like he had a problem.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the year of 2014-15.
Lamb said he had some health problems before, asking for a sick leave from Delta State University.
He was only teaching two classes online this year.
The recent changes in the university's employment policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a member of the staff, despite the degree of a doctor he worked so hard to win.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It's obvious that Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Forensic Investigator Methel Johnson announced that his family committed suicide with a single .38 caliber weapon in the backyard of a house about a mile from the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
Although Lamb was not determined why he went to this house immediately, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at 3,500 student universities in about 12,000 population cities in 2009, teaching geography and education.
He got his PhD in training in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
When Carla Hairston met through her fellow partners, she said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a nice guy who tried to teach guitar for a few years.
Back then, he was the one who beat the hearts fast.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon City, said to Lamb, "When he came, all the girls would melt."
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
In the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the edge of a river in Gautier.
The police say the dog is in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but they were always friends with Prentiss, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter is completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
He said he'd never met O'Steen Lamb, but his daughter Abigail said Lamb was interested in music and heard him play blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail performed at a summer festival.
And then Lamb and Abigail played together at the general shows.
O'Steen said he wrote and sang his daughter's music.
Prentiss was a nurse in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica to a few viewers.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and throw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, said that Professor Schmidt, who was murdered, directed the seminar on freshmen and specialised in American Indians and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from the University of Emporia State in Kansas and was president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended the candle sewing ceremony, including academics, university workers, students and local visitors.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial ceremony where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Great grace."
The classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring back our students," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Time to wrap the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis, Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to this news.
This article has been corrected by police to report that Lamb called 911 after he killed Schmidt and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as "his wife" on the 911 call, there is no official evidence that the two of them were married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit Less Vacation Season Employee
Toys R Us announced that he would not hire as many holiday season employees this year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said he would give more work to his current employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country, which was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates will begin this month and the number of personnel will increase from October to December.
Even though the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is coming up, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees who will help them sell products and sell products and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox made jokes about "Relationship with Princess Diana."
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and a stretch away from me.
A documentary about "Back to the Future" includes Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future for the first time 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me."
Back in Time VOD and DVD format will also be shown in some distinguished cinema.
UN Chief Sors There Is No Military Solution in Syria
About Russia's growing military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that about five years of Syrian problems "cannot be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons will only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all sides, including the divided UN Security Council, to meet and make constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
Ban said he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia and France at the UN General Assembly meeting on Wednesday at the end of the month.
The division between members of the Council and the citizens of Syria has expressed great regret that regional forces "have made the problem unsolvable."
Ban invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis as well as in the Iranian nuclear agreement.
The Eight Points Show Donald Trump Is Serious.
Some of them tried to label it as a volcano.
The others threw it at him like it was a joke.
And some of them support the internal explosion.
Some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in the polls, but that didn't work.
The last 11 national surveys led by Donald Trump showed him in double digits, and some of them are really starting to ask for the opportunity to run for real estate emperor.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican race.
Experts say that this time in 2011, Rick Perry's rise also led to a rise for Herman Cain, and neither of them won the nomination process in a single state.
And there are a lot of reasons why he's going to have trouble with the general election.
However, foreign groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative group, the Growth Club, realize Trump's permanent power and start spending their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent polls that indicate that the real estate emperor is only temporary:
Trump's preferred rates have changed 180 degrees.
A poll at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump declared his candidacy in mid-June showed that two of the 10 Republicans had a positive opinion for the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, that was 40%.
It was 52% in early August.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive opinion on Donald Trump.
In roughly 10, three of them have negative views.
And these numbers are high in early stages.
Last week, a poll in Iowa, Quinnipiac showed that 60% of the Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters might be happy to run for Trump.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two of the 10 people said that if he was nominated, they'd be "upset."
Only on the same level as Ben Carson Trump (43% will be "enthusiastic"), but for Trump, that is 40%.
The other person closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the company's favorite candidate, is going to be "unhappy" or "sad."
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Donald Trump is criticized for his flagrant language and insults, while 52% of the Republicans who were asked questions are convinced that the real estate emperor has the right sense to be president.
The same number applies in Iowa, where the country's first party board is being held, where 52% of the Republicans believe he has the personality to be the leader, according to Quinnipac last week.
He still thinks 44% of himself doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and according to the ABC / Post, six of the independent states say his humor does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to that idea.
When they wear their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN / ORC poll last week, when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four of the 10 people said Trump was the best.
A change from the end of July when four of the 10 people put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal sphere of GOP voters was not clear.
In the recent election cycle, four of the Republicans thought that Rick Perry would run, and only 28 per cent chose Mitt Romney, who was finally nominated.
The majority of the GOP voters still find Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts suggest that the messy area can contribute to Trump's advancement, and that anti-Trump support is also a fact that more than a dozen candidates are scattered.
However, a Monmouth University survey conducted in early September shows that Trump received the support of the majority at every time, in case of a head match between Trump and many Republican candidates.
Carly passes Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points.
Together with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible head start, Ben Carson passes the businessman at 19 points.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they made their decisions.
A new CBS / NYT poll released on Tuesday shows that more than half of the voters supporting Trump have locked their votes.
Frankly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can tell you that you're really not going to change your mind.
He said they left the door open to replace 46% candidates.
He's still Trump's biggest rival, Ben Carson, but voters who say they made their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in a campaign ad two months ago, the topic at the beginning and center of 2016 has become immigration.
Some think that Trump's overspoken speech has driven the important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and will damage their rebranding efforts.
According to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, however, six of the 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration issue stays on the agenda, Trump seems to be on the agenda.
The anger of the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are taking half the Republican vote because of their largely external situation.
Six of every 10 Republicans from the new ABC / Post poll on Monday say they want an outsider instead of one with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were angry at the Republicans in Congress, 54% were "unsatisfied" and 21% were "extremely angry."
In the prime minister's questions, Jeremy Corbyn will be on the stand for the first time.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn was expected to appear on the stand in the Prime Minister's Question Program.
For the first time, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the new Labour Party, will be on the stand in the prime minister's questions after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will soon ask six questions, and his performance will be closely examined by the media and the Labour Party MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more real" during the week.
He also said he could skip some sessions by leaving them to his colleagues.
This match will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, to appoint the shadow cabinet and to monitor his speech at the TUC annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party was criticized by some Tory MPs during the reading of the national anthem at the memorial ceremony Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the British War, and the front page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem has noted
A spokesman on behalf of Mr. Corbyn said he stood in a "respectful silence" and appreciated "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But one of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's News Night programme that he would advise the Labour Party leader to sing "independent" of his belief in the destruction of the monarchy.
Due to the differences in economy, defence and foreign relations, nearly a dozen shadows refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences in the Labour Party have also begun "to collapse," and that they are the issues of the government's higher limit implementation for assistance, as well as the appointment of Mr. Corbyn over the position in the European Union.
Mr. Corbyn said that at the TUC conference, the Labour Party has presented new changes to completely lifting the top limit.
Hours later, shadow work and retirement minister Mr. Smith said the party opposed only the government's downloading the top limit, 26,000 pounds, and it was "very clear" about that.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron will meet at the Commune Cemetery from the day he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader promised politics a different approach, and he said he received more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North MP told Prime Minister that the programme for Questions is very biased and that instead of making a sarcastic exchange with "answer growth," it will focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges that young people face.
When Mr. Corbyn wasn't himself, for example, when Mr. Cameron went abroad, the Prime Minister said that Angela Eagle would represent him in the program for Questions.
He even suggested that his other colleagues should go on this stand, and that he applied to John Bercow, the House of Commons, to take care of it.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics, which was often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Program, but a few years later he confessed to failing.
Since the first time it was published in 1990, the Prime Minister has said that the programme for Questions has been used as a fundamental measure point for leaders to measure their decision-making skills, dominance between the House of Commons and their positions among MPs; in response, some critics said it was caricitized and needed extensive reforms.
'In Joburg ': Homeless young people are studying photography
The city of Johannesburg is a tough place for homeless people.
But a group of old street kids found a way to win a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that taught homeless teenagers how to take pictures of their neighborhoods and get income from it.

The price rises with the increase in wages in the United Kingdom.
A rapid increase in the sternal increase in data showing that the fees in the United Kingdom have increased, while the FTSE 100 index has risen after its offer to buy for SABMiller.
Other than the bonus in the United Kingdom, prices increased 2.9% compared to the same period of last year between May and July.
This is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases, which has expressed the fastest increase since 2009.
The sterlin has gained more than 1% of the US dollars and increased to $1,5505 and $0.84% for the euro and increased to 1,3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 Index rose to 6.229.21 points with 1.49% increase.
At this height, the most prominent company was SABMiller, who made a 20% increase in his bid to buy the appeal from the EU InBev.
This offer will unite the two largest beer companies in the world and the famous brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9% due to positive profits from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales numbers have also shown that the expectations have risen, as well as the sale has begun to rise again in China, which is one of the key markets for Burberry.
The shares of the mining giant Glencore rose by 5% after the company announced that it had acquired $2.5 billion from the purchase of the debt reduction strategy.
The shares of Ambalaj and the paper group Mondi were among the most valuable lost shares after Goldman Sachs dropped his proposal for the company into "Sell" by 4.3%.
JD Sports' share increased by 3.1% after the company announced that its six-month pre-tax profit rose to 46.6 million pounds with an increase of 83%.
JD Sports boss said higher salaries can damage expansion.
JD Sports Board Chairman Peter Cowgill said the higher minimum wage for workers in England could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But according to him, this spending force can't afford to overcharge his own company's high-functioning expenses.
He added that costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans and could mean less work.
Metcash launched a public campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in South Australia and West Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and West Australia against $700 million in Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open the first of two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and are trying to create an IGA brand with main current and social media marketing and activities such as the Adelaide fair.
The IGA brochures and suppliers also contribute to companies like the Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo, who offer a taste test at IGA stores, and the owners who sell their loyal clients their South Australia football league tickets with a discount.
Food, booze and hardware wholesale Metcash is expected to provide more details about the defence strategy as the annual investor strategy is improving its day on 29 September.
The risk is great because South Australia and West Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and produces higher snow margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners are negatively short-sighted and enjoying a much stronger market share than they made in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% in GA and 24% in BA, compared to Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take about 5% of the market market market in 12 months after opening their first store in these two states, and that his sales will be taken away by current players but generally without blemish retail workers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA peracenters would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 30 stores in the GA in 25 and BA next year and get $500 million in each market and $600 million in sales.
Mr. Kierath said that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high-fixed cost base volume could cost Metcash about 13 million dollars before interest and tax.
At the same time, Metcash loses his market share in eastern states, including Aldi and Coles, despite the recent Roy Morgan research that reveals that the IGA clients are the most loyal clients.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will decrease 4.1% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass, leader fund manager, said that Metcash "could probably be erased in ten years at a business dinner in Melbourne."
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass's comments.
However, it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The IGA market share has been reduced from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's profits from the food and market business that provided about 1,200 IGA peracendeci have dropped by 43% since 2012, while sales and margins have been under pressure, show that business leverage rate has decreased.
However, the wholesaler resists, making more than 150 million dollars a year to invest in the shelf prices that match at Coles and Woolworths every week, helping the IGA retail workers to replenish their stores, adding fresh foods that grow faster, and opening a better private label market series to the public.
The board of Metcash's executive board, Ian Morrice, says that price matching and store renewal programmes have begun to result and that the wholesale has been expected to return to basic snow growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokinakis is supported by Tennis Australia head Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism.
According to Tennis Australia chief Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis was on the side of the accidental damage to the last storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and he deserves more credit than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, commonly referred to as "Special K," found himself under the spotlight that did not welcome himself because of the humiliating beating of Stan Wawrinka at Kyrgios' Montreal Masters.
When Kokinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison left the elephant referee twice in the afternoon game in Cincinnati, Harrison said, "Wawrinka came over Kyrgios and I must go over that boy."
Kokkinakis, who was last seen in US Open, potentially breaking Richard Gaspet's racket, was defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for a second solo mission behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semi-final.
Healy said, "What I feel very eager is that I think that Thanasi is being challenged."
He broke his racket when he closed his front and lost, but he's not the first player to break a racket because he's disappointed in himself, and I know that Thanasi knows enough that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in the United States, he handled himself quite well under highly provocative circumstances with Harrison and the others, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's had a little too much on him.
Although he's 19 years old, he works very hard, and he's adapting to the team, he has no problem with other players, he's being treated with great respect in the dressing room, he's a very stable and mature young man, and he deserves to be judged on his own terms.
Healy also supported Kyrgios's decision to welcome the important union; on Friday, he began to announce that the right thing for everyone from now on is to "take a mutual decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term blacksmith.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the game, not the competition around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And to me, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray say, the kid has grown up very fast, and he has made some terrible mistakes in front of the public, and he deserves all the criticism he's taken, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the spotlight, he thinks that my opinion is appropriate, the team and his best for himself.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declared an emergency, closed borders and detained immigrants
Hungary declared an emergency Tuesday to cut the migration flow and closed the southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to break into the country illegally.
With hundreds of immigrants piling up in neutral areas, create chaos on the border, and Serbian officials have acted in rage.
Immigrants who came running from violence in their own country built a tent on the side of the road for an uncertain time between the two countries' checkpoints.
But their anger grew increasingly.
As a police helicopter passed above, the immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused to protest the water and food they were given.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said that it is unacceptable for Hungary to send immigrants back as the migration flow continues from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) does not want to be harmed by this process but to be part of the solution.
In the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries will have to be held, "Ivica Dacic Pragda said.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a joint immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 immigrants attacking Greece and Italy, and expressed hope that by the end of the next month or the end of the year, there will be an agreement on accepting 120,000 more immigrants from Hungary.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a EU summit next week to discuss this immigration crisis facing the continent.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call in the two southern areas on Tuesday gives authorities broad authority to fight the crisis, including closing roads and expediting cases related to refugees.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country plans to pull barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the migration flow from this country after the barbed wire drawn to the border of Serbia.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons were appointed in efforts to pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a key narrow and transit point for the European Union countries, and most of these immigrants are refugees who have escaped from wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the immigrants who have come are "economical immigrants" for a better life than innocent people who have come to flee from the war -- that idea is completely contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
In Hungary, laws adopted at midnight bring more severe punishments to human traffickers, as well as making it a crime to cross a four-foot barbed wire drawn to the border of Serbia (13 feet) or to harm it.
"The Hungarian government is declaring an emergency because of the situation caused by mass migration," Zoltan Kovacs, government spokesman in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
One thing is clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Although the military position should be approved by parliament yet, the Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen the men with dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities have captured 15 people who have crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border.
They went through the barbed wire, and now they're under police custody, and under new laws, they're accused of committing crimes.
Authorities are rapidly repairing barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia Tuesday morning, using a train wagon covered in barbed wire to close one of the passages.
The chaos also reflected at the main border crossing point near Roszke, as the Hungarians launched a small metal container for processing.
20 people were able to get in, but thousands of them stayed outside.
Another group of immigrants said they would not accept food and water assistance until they were allowed to enter Hungary by blocking the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
Selection 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority over Bernie Sanders decreases by half in the national election
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton remains a two-digit leader in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but you. Bernie Sanders is catching up to her.
Clinton is currently taking 47% of the Democtarian vote (down from 58%), and Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't yet announced whether or not he's in the presidential race, gets 15% of the democratic vote.
In more than five months before the main races began, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton's supporters have better ideas about their own choices than other candidates.
Since the CBS News last month, Clinton has lost its floor between a series of demographic groups, but Sanders has some gains.
Clinton has a huge difference between women and the moderates, but that difference is closing.
His support between men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only following him five points from behind.
Clinton's 50-year-old Democratic voter advantage has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton has a huge difference to the old voters.
Last month, Clinton was moving between the liberals in front of Sander with two digits, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
About half of the national-level democratic voters say they would support Clinton with passion if he became a candidate for the party.
One quarter will support him on certain conditions, while another 15 per cent will only support him if he is nominated.
A six-percent cut doesn't support Clinton.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly inclined to support him with passion.
The views between those who don't support Clinton right now are more complicated -- only a quarter of them can support him with passion.
While 48 per cent of the Democrats are passionate about supporting Clinton, fewer Republican leading candidates are talking about Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When asked Clinton's supporters why Clinton wanted to run, the first answer is that he had the right experience (16%), and now it's time to choose a female president (13%) and that he's the best candidate for business (10%).
Clinton's supporters also express his relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Competitive in problems and selective are among the criteria specified.
As a vice president with potential for president, 57 per cent of Democratic voters might want to see him race, but the third half doesn't think so.
When Democtrat voters are asked what the second candidate elections are for the party, Biden is top of the line.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, according to Sander, suggests that Biden may have second choices in open range.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton's superiority increases in Sanders; her level of 20 points in a race with Biden rises to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate to win a general election, but that number went from 78% to this level last month.
Although it is second in view of this angle, it is far back, but the percentage of those who see it as the most eligible candidate has increased.
Once again asked what the most important thing in a candidate is, the Democratic voters hold the issues in front of electability.
No Democratic voter candidate or candidate such as last month seems unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidate candidates perform well in some major characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as powerful leadership.
In terms of honesty, Clinton is strong in leadership when he's number one among three.
According to 30 per cent of the Democratic voters, Clinton is honest and unreliable, while half of it says the same for Sanders (15%), 27 per cent have no idea.
Democratic voters also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction as their ideology.
In all measures, the quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions continue to include personal e-mail address and server during the State Department mission, most Democratic voters find the explanation satisfactory and say their views on the issue are not affected.
But that's a different story in general American public.
Half the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, but only one third find them satisfactory.
The public's views were divided in March shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most Americans say e-mail conflicts don't affect their general opinion of Clinton, but on the other hand, their negative ideas have increased according to 36 per cent.
These are mostly Republicans, and more than six people say their views on Clinton have been disrupted.
Although Clinton is considered honest and reliable by the voters of his own party, it is still a problem among registered voters: only 32% see him honest and reliable, this number has dropped eight points since last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty percent of registered voters don't find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country don't find Trump honest and reliable.
However, Clinton and Trump are getting a good grade on leadership.
Among the six candidates who attended the test, Biden, Carson and Bush received the best points for honesty.
More often think Sanders is honest, but as Carson does, most of them don't have an idea about him.
The margin for error from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
This is Carson standing right behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News / New York Times poll, I'm Carson running close to Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the candidates are in touch with the vote, and other candidates don't have much luck.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, climbing 27% in the last CBS survey before the debate at Fox News last month.
But the support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson was doing very well in demographic groups, and that the support between university graduate Republican voters was much higher than Trump.
The rest have now fallen to 2% in support of the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, which was 10% last month.
Former Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This latest survey was made by 376 people selected among Republican voters, the margin for error was made 6% and the poll was conducted in September.
Last week, the last CNN / ORC survey showed Carson's support between the Republicans at 19%, right behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News / Washington Post has seriously shown Trump in front of Carson.
Last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to wave at retired neurosurgeon randomly.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday, "We need energy."
Five fraternity members, Baruch College, are charged with the death of a freshman.
During a adoption ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, almost two years after the death of a college student, five people were sued for murder.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013 at a inauguration ceremony, and according to the police, it contributed to his death by postponing taking him to the hospital.
Authorities have reported that his eyes have been blindfolded, that a backpack full of 30 libres of sand was stuck on his back, and that he was constantly clawing at the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained over time that his head was hurting and then he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 after Deng went down, and according to the police, they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner at the press conference, meanwhile, they changed Deng's clothes, Googled symptoms and asked for advice by contacting the national leader of the brotherhood, Andy Meng.
At this point, Lieutenant Wagner said that members began to hide personal items and put the best of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't be played, and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered trauma from blunt force trauma to the head, torso, and hip.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said a lot of families have been destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood's adoption ceremony, losing their lives at least one student initiation every year since 1970.
Brotherhood and members must be held responsible for this and this step by authorities is very important.
The grand jury in Monroe County recommended trial for murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with the adoption ceremony and the criminal conspiracy for the attack.
At a press conference Tuesday, Wagner said if there is an organization that confirms it, not only those involved, but officially or unofficially, we will blame them too.
Baruch has banned the College brotherhood and the national brotherhood has ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed increases interest rates?
With interest rates up, the bull market is upside down and the bond revenue climbs, and the economy records feedback.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this is going to take.
History, especially in the economy, offers little information about timing.
The decline took as long as 86 months, as the decline occurred in 11 months after the first interest rate increased.
The US Central Bank has often determined Fed's aggression to increase interest rates in the reaction of economic and financial beings, although it is not continuous.
That's why the US central bank officials strongly emphasize that investors should focus on how long the normalisation process should be focused, not when the interest starts to increase.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
However, market participants may think that the anxiety of interest increase has been exaggerated.
"It is inevitable that Fed's first interest increase since the global financial crisis has been interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' period," Capital Economics Global Bashonomist Julian Jessop said in a note to customers.
On the contrary, we don't expect US interest rates to return slowly to normal, but the levels still low are seen as seismic impact that most of them are afraid of.
Still, we can't say they won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy can react to this:
As the market has seen in the past months, waiting to increase interest rates may destabilize some things for a while.
And once the interest is increased, the effect is not that specific.
In a new investigation into what will happen after the Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "The subsidies of the resource are seen as a 12-24-month pause train after the first interest increase, which may reflect the pause in money policy."
According to a current analysis by Bob Doll of the Nuveen Property Management analyst, the market has often recorded sharp increases in the last 35 years and has moved to a straight line towards interest increase -- around 14 per cent -- 250 per cent -- 250 days later (2.6 per cent increase) and has returned to normal in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on the stock has become more specific in the following stages of the interest increase cycle, and the revenue is facing extinction.
Reflections are a fact of economic life, but interest increases help them.
In the current situation, the Fed faces some cases that have not existed before and will speed up the decline.
The most remarkable is that the geographical domestic reimbursement is at the lowest level so far for the Fed interest increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increased since 1950 fell only two times below 4.5 per cent from the nomine year to year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 took place at 3.6 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed, it is expected to be permanent by very few and watch at 1.5 per third quarter.
According to Deutsche, it may be risky to increase interest rates in such a delicate economic environment and lead to the question, "Is it going to be different this time?"
For a year, Fed's market participants have been waiting for interest increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which will end Thursday.
Although most strategists believe the economist FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, the term trade points to only 25 per cent probability.
"In the research we've done since 1950, all of the increasing cycles that have been happening so far are in a super-rising trend cycle, and with the unrealistic domestic interest, it is rapidly reaching the pre-reforming peaks," the report said in the report.
On the contrary, this was an unprecedented slow recovery of the worst decline in an exemplary period.
The current cycle has been the longest cycle Fed has waited for since the last setback -- the longest cycle on the record has been 35 months, and the cycle we're in is still in the 74th.
With the market expected to increase interest, the steady income has become unstable, and order is similar to a few sources of self-interest.
The difference is that when the Fed changes the course of politics, the effect is faster than the bonds are in the bonds.
When the first increase of the cycle comes, the bond returns don't change direction immediately.
At the end of the interest increase cycle, the bonds are dropping immediately, "Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy experts, the increase in interest will bring closer revenues between the long and shorter bonds to flatten the slope.
We said that high-income bonds usually perform better in such an environment, but "We're still careful about getting the revenue," said Kathy Jones, a Schwab analyst.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in the potential for dollars and inflation, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to the tighter monetary policy," he said.
The short-term interest increases, the tax curve expands, and the fluctuation increases -- all the features that will be seen in the market when the FED tightens politics.
In large terms, companies that do most of their work in the United States will increase interest rates and earn local products to be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse because growing dollars will make products more expensive in the global market and their debt will be even more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks could have a performance decrease at the beginning of such an increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for their clients.
The companies with strong balance, following the increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, passed by the weak bilanchists by 5 per cent.
The companies with high capital revenue and low-fluctuating stock stocks passed their low-quality competitors by 4 per cent (3 per cent).
The debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with a high degree of wavy courtship debt are the most likely to get hurt.
Other than the safi market game, consumers will benefit from increasing dollars.
Although experts have different views on how fast it's going to hold, the investors can be profitable from higher gains.
Andrew Bingham said BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has accused the station of "being overthrown."
He argued that the radio was becoming more and more different than his commercial opponents.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of screwing up the Brit Awards.
His deputy friend Damien Collins accused The Voice of not being original.
An advanced deputy pressured the publisher to reveal the difference between BBC Radio 3 and the Classic FM, saying it was becoming "the difference between other commercial stations."
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the radio channel, which gives the BBC bosses public service, is "sinking" and is increasingly different from commercial competitors.
"I don't like to use that phrase, but Radio 3" is getting stale, "and it's becoming a classic FM."
In addition, the first one also targeted the BBC Music Awards held last December.
It's another version of the BBC Music Awards Brit Awards that started last year.
"So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that I can think of, but you keep copying what already exists in the market," Bingham said.
The BBC chief of directors rejected the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of its commercial opponents in terms of live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm gonna go find out something else about classical music.
And that's commitment to live music, and making music can't be matched by anything else.
He also said that Radio 3's efforts to explore and promote new music are very important.
BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio should work harder at the beginning of this year to reach more listeners than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the BBC's commercial competition at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sports Election Committee.
Congresswoman Tory Damien Collins also challenged that Voice - the BBC's Dutch production company, Talpa Media, to a music talent contest where he received a loan of 22 million pounds.
Can't you see why the program makes so much noise because it's not original and it doesn't have a special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was held as a jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was "made with a BBC-based basis."
He said the agency wanted him to find a hit of his own blood before making a fun show again.
However, in the future, he refused to accept the idea of preventing the construction of more Sound programmes or spending the amount of license fees on other formats.
Black Friday is the reason Internet sales have the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, Internet sales increased by seven percent.
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since 2000, when records began to break.
Three years ago, online sales erupted when mobile devices began to be used in shopping.
Experts say that the Black Friday in November could cause the decline of spending
The online shopping has been blowing up for over a decade and turning England's most living shopping streets into ghost town.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say Internet sales have given more and more signs of weakening.
In the total amount of spending in August, only a five per cent increase has been made last year, and the lowest growth has been seen since 2000, when records began to break.
After figures showing only seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say Internet sales have given more and more signs of weakening.
"If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially 2000, you will see that everything has been normal over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, to the Guardian.
The Internet sales increased three years ago when consumers started using their cell phones to buy products, he added.
It meant that more people could shop even when they were lying on the couch.
But right now, the horizontal is going, so you can see the descent.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is shown as one of the reasons for the slowdown of sales.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place last Friday, to buy things.
At last year's event, five times as many consumer cheap products were attacked by companies' websites to capture, and many companies' sites collapsed.
Experts say that the shoppers are fighting for a discount, the Black Saturday shoppers may have resorted "for now."
An investigation published by the British Union of Peracenters revealed that each £1 pound spent on the Internet buying products.
A third of the products such as TV and washing machines are now being bought from Internet stores.
Besides, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the family of bin Laden found guilty, Muslims lead to their final journey to those who died in a crane accident in Mecca.
After the first funerals in Mecca, 29 people lost their lives, their body was carried out on the streets by Muslims.
As responsible for a crane accident in Saudi Arabia, construction giant Saudi Binladin held the group responsible.
The health ministry reported that 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry out the maintenance of 29 people who lost their lives by the fall of a crane into the Sacred Mosque.
Most of the crowds in white have closed roads to see their first funerals on their final journey to Mecca's Cemetery.
The painful mass passed through the sacred place where a crane tore down the ceiling of the mosque and collapsed on the pilgrims a few days ago.
In the case of 394 wounded, the owner of the Saudi Kingdom's construction conglomerate, Binladin, was brought to be buried.
The lives of 29 pilgrims who lost their lives by the fall of a crane into the Sacred Mosque were carried on their shoulders along the way.
Four children from the Bolton region of Manchester, where the crane fell among the dead, were also the father of November Akram.
Mr. Akram came to the Sacred Mosque with his parents at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi leaders have announced that the pilgrimage will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
Today, King Salman announced that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the crane's arm open while it is out of use.
In an Arabic version of the declaration by the State's Saudi Press Agency, the only side to blame for the incident was the Bindadin Group.
The news agency's English service has not passed this detail, but firm officials have reported a ban on exiting the country.
At the beginning of the week, Salman swore that the crane would find the reason why hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to the Sacred Mosque at the end of the month.
The Binladin group has not made any statement about the fallen crane, and their representatives have not been allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking current security measures and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
The Holy Mosque, which is in Mecca, is surrounded by dozens of vines, and many of these buildings are under the leadership of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close relations with Saudi Arabia's executive family for decades, and most of the construction projects are the head names.
Osama bin Laden, the last leader of Al Qaeda's organization, was also a twisted son of the family, which the family banned from adoption.
The accident occurred only a few days before every adult Muslim was forced to visit at least once in their lives, when there was heavy wind and rain.
Authorities have reported 158 people still being treated at the hospital.
Authorities have instructed the families of the dead and survivors of permanent injury to pay compensation for 1 million Riyal (174,000 pounds).
The other wounded will take half that amount.
B & Q boss says you have Eastern European craftsman working cheap behind this train.
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more masters.
Behind this increase lies the number of East European master craftsmen.
As a result, the 200 new Srewfix stores targeting the craftsmen are opening up.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes the sales point of 60 B & Q across the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Editor-in-Chief
The British are told to hire skilled Eastern European craftsman to do business in their homes instead of leaving their hammers and paint brushes in their hands.
If you're capable of using hammers or painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B & Q, the British are increasingly working to do more and more DIY jobs in their homes.
The new head of Kingfisher's housekeeping chain, Veronique Laury, said there was a huge increase in the number of Eastern European skilled craftsman who served low prices behind this train.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Srewfix stores for the crafts while closing the 60 B & Q sales point.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women hired at B & Q stores because eight of the ten purchases in the store were given by women.
Most of the staff are male right now.
The single woman's house, which has improved more houses than the past, said it was a need to meet the developing demographic trends.
"Men are still working in our stores most of the time.
We need to establish more balance.
Basically, half of our clients are made by women and 80% of the decisions on products bought by women.
Women play a huge role in the process of making decisions.
One of the five women in charge of Britain's leading companies, Miss Laury, restructured her top team to form an equal number of men and women managers.
Kingfisher, including the general manager and finance manager, 50% of his team are almost alone in this area with women.
"This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find the good women to buy for our board of directors.
After the group overloaded the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced that there was a decline in lower-month profits and sales.
As a result, Kingfisher will open 200 new stores, owned by Screwfix and B & Q.
It's time for the US Central Bank to decide to increase interest for FED
The US Central Bank is being monitored by the world on Wednesday and Thursday; it is expected to determine whether interest rates will be increased in ten years.
In a poll by Reuters, a little more than half of 80 economists said the FED would implement this decision last week, and now they think it will suspend the decision and keep the rates between 0-0.25 per cent.
Since it's seven years since the FED has reduced the rates to zero, this is a historic event.
"For the first time, we will witness the process of normalisation of interest rates from the zero point of a large central bank," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson International Institute of Economics.
The US economy is relatively good at performing and adding trillions of dollars to the balance during the reenactment of the economy and creating a small amount of inflation.
But the FED cannot ignore the less promising global painting.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are also indications that they believe the situation will not allow such a rise.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 8: 00.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left a letter of apology.
On Tuesday, authorities said that Shannon Lamb left a note in Mississippi that said that she was sorry for the first murder before killing her girlfriend with a gun and later on that day, and that if I could take it back, she would have left a wish.
The Mississippi Gautier police are calling 911 around 10: 00 p.m., a geographic and social science instructor at Delta State University.
He said he said he shot and killed Monday and someone with a gun.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the officer on the phone.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb said, also said there was a cute dog in the house that didn't hurt anyone, and he was probably upset.
The police asked for her name, but she didn't mention her name.
Lamb never made any explanation for the murder.
When the police went to the scene, they found a note written by a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb: "I wish I could take back time.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After Lamb wrote this note, he drove his car to Delta State 300 miles away and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then the cops trapped him and killed him.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It's obvious that Lamb had something in mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that his girlfriend Prentiss had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, authorities said they had no "knowledge or evidence" on Tuesday.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good man."
The couple got divorced 15 years ago, but they were friends.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her 19-year-old daughter were found and that she was "devastated."
O'Steen also said that Prentiss and her daughter were "definitely each other's best friends."
Linsday Knowless, who Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, stated that he was working online at the Prentiss house.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
"He always liked to help others," Knowles said.
Police say Lamb called his relatives on Monday and said, "I'm not going to jail."
The same night the police approached him at Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself with a gun and killed himself.
According to the CV released on the university's website, Lamb received a Ph.D. at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their old charm
The actor (left), seen with his son Redmond (right), has spent several very stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he sacrificed his life friend Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who was also told to fight drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
Of course, all this has hurt her a lot.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in the match that Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
This incident that engulfed the defense player in tears will leave him out of the field for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal Shaw hopes that he can return to the fields this season.
In the 15th minute of the match that Shaw, 20, fell like a bomb on the game field, led to an indiscreet attempt with Héctor Moreno.
For nine minutes, he was intervened in the field, and then he needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital right now."
Today or a day later, maybe he'll be transferred to surgery in Manchester.
It sucks -- a young man who transferred to Manchester when he was 18 years old, let him have a hard time first, then make a great game, and then this happens to him.
He had an oxygen mask on his face when he was in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that means at least six months, which means you can't play in a group phase.
I'm hoping he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with the red card and the penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer made a mistake.
When I tell you this is a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a very bad fight with two legs.
The tweet in Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my healing path begins now, and I will return with strength."
Interested: Luke Shaw in the Manchester United PSV defeat is suffering from a shock of injury.
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be a moral for the recovery of the British defence player.
The PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "A very bad injury."
If this kind of injury happens to any player, everyone gets upset.
Our players never intend to cripple their opponent.
In the 2014 World Cup, Moreno also had a broken leg playing for Van Gaal's Mexican team against the Netherlands.
He found it difficult because he never intended to cripple his opponent, and he said it was not good after hearing that it was a very bad break.
In my case, it was impossible to see that moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in different directions, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's bush.
"I know what it feels like. I know how hard it can be.
I feel so bad about this, and I'm so sorry.
He was hospitalized in a struggle with Chris Smalling in Andrés Guardado of PSV.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
It's something that every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know it won't take you much time to learn it by heart.
Apparently, if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a child-care programmer what his favorite child book was, Prime Minister The Lorax chose Dr. Seuss's 1971-exit environmental tale.
"I like to read to my children because it has a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message in it that we've always missed an image or a message."
So far, everything was going so well, until Cameron wrote something about the contents of the book, but actually to add new characters and details to inflate the contents of the original storybook, the paragraph summarized by the 2012 film version.
A child named Ted in Thneed-Ville, whose whole nature is destroyed, even with walls of air, says she wants to perform a real tree vision to win Audrey's heart, including a story of love that Dr. Seuss did not know in 1991.
If this doesn't sound suspicious enough to you, the text Cameron received in the Internet Film Archive is very similar to the short summary text of The Lora film, which starts to say, "A girl named Ted wants to win Audrey's heart in Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and air is a commodity."
According to the claims that Cameron was a well-known parent, it seems unlikely that an anonymous young boy would be aware of the main issue of the book, despite the objections of the creature called Lorax, the one with the mustache and the "talking for the trees," which cut trees, and the book that he heard was destroyed by the stable-knit Once-ler.
Probably such a weak PR job, transferred to an order servant, which apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
One of the presidential spokesman said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied from Cameron's staff, but he didn't comment on anything other than that.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England's extraction, but he's still intact.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, it's a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat that happened last time, I don't think it's on the cards.
Still, I don't rule out an exfil victory.
Alastair Cook's team may have been less experienced than three years ago, but he has players who have turned well on the batting line, and the collective game sense is strong; they don't heal 2012's wounds; they only provide a little youth-based optimism.
In the game, Moeen Ali is developing as a gamer, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even though the quality of the trial level is unknown.
Interested: Adam Lyth came out of the British Testing Team and replaced Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyze as head coach in Yorkshire.
Seven trials were against two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricklers are judged according to the outcome.
For example, there was no question mark on Joe Root, because he had to make an announcement because -- as I said before -- players were his best choices.
After a few fifty-point series, Lyth could have seen his career grow, but he chose his own destiny.
If he works more for Yorkshire, I hope he gets another chance.
Although Britain's chief coach Trevor Bayliss had not performed his best performance, he praised the player's attitude, which didn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes for a test hitter to get a note.
Lyth -- like Sam Robson before him -- took seven caps, and on the other hand, Nick Compton bought nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott is that England may first go to the Caribbean - while Lyth's form is at the top - but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level shooter.
An X-factor cricketer, and we saw it in Yorkshire when Trent Bridge scored 236 points against us at the beginning of this season.
At least for the same opportunity as before, but that depends on the team formation of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen taking an opening shot next to Cook to get extra game spin while holding four Quick, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a shooter can't shoot here, and this left-hand catcher has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done her job for Worcestershire, but she saw a number three for them, and it's not that different.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 trials at his first fall before he started his debut in 2001.
He grabbed three hundred series right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup gamer and surprises me as an impressive young man in my limited talks with him.
People can see raw statistics -- 31 averages in the shot and 35 averages in the ball -- and they might think it's a degaj, but there's not a lot of gamblers lifting their hands, and the casting elections were made on the side of the younger one.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Far from the team, England seems to have made some tricky contributions to its own coaching team.
The appointment of the Sri Lanka batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the trial games may be an ingenious precaution.
One of the most adorable men in that game will bring with him a lot of experience, under every circumstances, against all the sluts.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot of the tour and gives both energy and game order a brutal series.
I always thought he was born for international cricket, whether he was a player or a coach, and he has a sense of guidance like Mahela.
Sometimes new noises in the dressing room, even messages that have been said before, could bring a new innovation to the team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is being bugged for a day's play, Root was given a similar break to Australia, and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, plans are not made by trainers and players.
And you must remember that like actors, their business depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
If the economy is stable by 2017, Brexit can win.
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and it's like, "Yes or no?"
Strangers have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomat recently stated that some member states are tired of the day of the EU, which has gone through all kinds of crisis that they don't want most of it, Britain's only self-thinking separatist concessions and business-dealing agreement changes.
In his annual interview in Brighton, the TUC ruled that if it damaged social protection, he didn't want any of this.
In fact, we could call it Dave and George's own agenda.
Prime Minister and Chancellor say they attend peaks or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries and take pictures of it before famous monuments, and then return to their country and collect allies for reform.
This is all about me.
"Do not leave us alone with France" said Berlin, my European friend, who wants an external Britain in the EU tent, who is increasingly short-sighted in some capitals, and authorities have come to a point where they don't care if we stay.
Germany's cautious and sane chancellor, Angela Merkel, has been in power for 10 years, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) want to leave power before it gets worse.
François Hollande, in France, facing reelection in 2017 or change of power.
It's a fading force.
Soon, a nationalist government from the right side of Poland and a left-wing government in Spain will come to power.
Selfie, who needs to use her energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, is unlikely to make an effort for the British because they don't want it because most of them have discriminatory tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning to accelerate the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that will not help during the 2017 referendum campaign in the Scottish National Party style; that's what my friend says.
"Renegotiation was not an option," and "Britain has achieved nothing to benefit from renegotiation."
Europeans know how exploiting, oligarchical press barons were because they weren't like that at the time of Tony Benn, at a rate of 2 to 1, they were inspired by the 1975 referendum that approved our initiative in 1973.
In the early '90s, they remember Boris Johnson, the head Euro-oportunist, who was known as "EU flat bananas."
All their foolishness aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax thugs, strangers listening to illegal phones, and so-called foreign residents with most of our great newspapers.
Tony Blair often thought the same thing about them, but when a horny gorilla was trapped in a cage, he realized that he needed to distract him by giving him a banana so he wouldn't eat at lunch and tea.
In fact, Miliband was also Blairci of Blair to oppose Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, because Blair had agreed on the principle of the EU constitution, which was cancelled by French and Dutch voters who gave him an exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But what I told him on Monday that he had no time to lose -- Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, who was now in danger of regaining Murdoch's boycott strategy in the '80s, which is now a mistake.
Even if it takes time, it needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday, especially not with me.
I politely express Corbyn's official position in Europe.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people who are left out of the hostile tendency of Ukip and the passionate supporters of Conservative Little Britain say yes to that.
"That's what Hilary Benn, a Benn, but not Bennite, said on radio and television this week, because she forced herself not to admit that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor.
It reminded me that in the '70s, his father's struggle with his friends in the labor cabinet for infidelity, that he didn't go too far, that he lost his duty in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But with Benn's testimony -- fighting to stay in every condition -- not what McDonnell said or what the JC told the lords at a special meeting on Monday night.
Given the fact that he touched me, the detail Corbyn is trying to convey continues to protect the importance of message discipline in the age of 24 TV and especially in the social media vortex, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to give Cameron a hard time in Europe to guarantee the support of the Labour Party at the referendum.
That's exactly what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist backgrounds of McDonnell and Corbyn are no longer a private discussion between the left wing opponents, which are now just the basic stones of the educational ambitions of small difference narcissism.
As he passed on Nato -- Tom Watson, determined that the JC will not campaign to leave -- foreign diplomats will have to deal with a reason for their masters in their country.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital on concessions to Britain, where they can all be wasted, with their own questionable voters?
As I was told at the opening of the British Effective Security Forum on Monday, the United States is already very disappointed by the weak minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the ruling cost-reduction Conservative Party government.
Experts criticize British Public Health e-cigarette research
Investigators have expressed allegations that the e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking at a 12-person meeting with people connected to the tobacco industry, funded by the government.
Experts in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticism of evidence used in the British Public Health report on e-smoking.
The PHE released its report last month, which described "detailed examination of evidence" as "the turning point."
But some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and noted links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet medical magazine's title last month targeted "extraordinarily rotten basis" based on the main outcome of the PHE.
Another two researchers at the BMW questioned whether the allegations were "built on sand or rock."
"The basic principle of public health is based on the event evidence of policy," said Simon Capewell, a clinical epidemiology professor at the University of Liverpool and Martin McKee at London Hijyen and Tropical Medicine.
They said it would be expected for the PHE to rely on a detailed review of evidence and modeling, claiming that it is "less than 95% harmful than smoking an e-cigarette," according to the best estimate available.
In fact, the results of this meeting came from a 12-person meeting to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of their views on various products involving nicotine; the results of this meeting have been summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called Eurowiss Heath, which was reported to have received funds from British American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
They also said that in a sustainability report, the BAT approved the public health release document.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported that they received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but they added that it wasn't the one reported from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
The panel members were not informed how they were elected, but among them are some known giants of e-cigarette, which some reported in the article.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person in charge of tobacco at the PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell said that the group's research article "effectively" has a lack of concrete evidence about the damage of most products. "
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that "There is no evidence that an e-cigarette is a way to smoke for children or non-smoking people."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and prosperity at the PHE, said the allegations at the BMW have already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two people with a life-long smoker is dying because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared to the health risks, but we must continue to examine their long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear task: to inform the public about what evidence shows and does not show at a time when it is particularly confused about their damage when it is compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people a year die of a disease associated with smoking, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
We are doing our national responsibility, making it clear that the current evidence -- although the E-cigarette is not risky, is only carrying a small portion of the damage caused by smoking.
Former Channel 4 chief said the BBC should release EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that their ad competitors could "give their right arms" to hit programs such as Albert Square shows.
Johnson said the license fee should be used only to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes such as BBC4, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller audience, against the most ratings-field programmes of his competitors in valuable intervals.
After Tony Hall, director of the BBC, said the institution wanted to co-operate more with other organizations; Johnson said it was tried successfully in its own time at Channel 4 to establish a connection with the BBC.
During an interrogation about the future of the BBC, Johnson said, "I am struggling with the idea of the BBC ordering and publishing programs that can be clearly shown by non-subsidized competitors."
If you continue to apply a license fee that I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, at least your exit has to be reduced to programs that no one else has ever done or ordered.
He's broadcasting The Voice in the range of primetime because they want to provide as much support for the future as possible.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish it, which is ridiculous and clearly ridiculous.
"I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded by a reduced rate of tax.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, and it's actually made within the company.
To be honest, other channels give their right arms to do that.
I'm trying to see how public service publications work.
I don't think that's going to make the BBC any less.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who run Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused "the BBC of pursuing ratings because of the passion of people working here and because they consider this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
The BBC's comments on its most popular programmes repeat comments by former Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC should sell their programmes like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to BBC4, and that they couldn't measure viewers here, but that they could meet tax pardon and argue to continue their showering religious duties on the income of 4 billion pounds, and he added: "Of course we are doing all these sites that no one has ever seen."
They put these in holes where no one will ever see them.
"I invite you to find a more regrettable system for those who provide the best benefit from it.
Of course you're all thinking, we're all thinking, 150 pounds a year is a big value, but I wonder if the reason why they do it is because they don't watch too much BBC for people who have a lot of money.
Meanwhile, David Elstein, former Sky and Channel 5 executive, who presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revitalize the Reithian mission for "information, education and entertainment."
Some of the BBC's output is now officially classified as education -- this is 0.1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio -- and the public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be front-foot and this should be changed to "information, lighting and training."
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should only do something on TV about a handful of Proms and co-operate with advertising publishers to ensure that all of them are monitored online.
'Sonogenetic 'allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how silk worms change direction as soon as they're hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have raised maggots with genetically modified neural systems that can be controlled by sound wave explosions.
Tiny thread wolves change direction as soon as people are shot with sound vibrations, which they can't hear.
The vibrations are activated by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry dice channels that respond to audio waves.
Interested: researchers read and write brain activity with light
Investigators said maggots have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetic, so an ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
From the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, researcher Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian said that this procedure could replace the deep-brain stylization, which gives people electrical vibrations to their brains one day to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The thread wolves often don't react beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they react when they're surrounded by liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he's found are amplifying the sound waves and allowing them to pass through the maggots.
The reinforced subsonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membrane of some maggots' cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
Chalasani genetically altered maggots to make certain motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels to create silk wolves controlled by sound.
When he applied audio to the altered creatures, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transmitted into maggots and activated motor neurons here.
This procedure is similar to the optogenetics, which allows scientists to operate and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages to this technique.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent to the point in the brain through an optical fiber, low-frequency subsonic waves can pass through the tissue and be sent over the skull into the brain.
"We believe that human neurons, targeted in clinical environment for certain neurological treatments, can be temporarily sensitive to the audio signal," Chalasani said, using a gene therapy and a therapeutic virus.
Other applications can focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment... right on the doorstep!
Advertising condemns England's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapon fair video.
Scary killer drones!
The shackles that ripped off your ankle!
Piece-by-piece bombs!
And electric shocks that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The British government's ExCel Centre at the London Pier has no doubt that the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp deception, designed to emphasize the willingness to sell weapons to pressure regimes via the International of Defence and Security equipment.
Subject: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian regimes attack in London
But a different campaign continues with bus stops and posters on subway trains and requires double-checking.
"Are you going to travel to the DLR from September 15th to September 18th," he said, using London Metro funds and brand?
This September, a pack of arms dealers will attack the DLR... and customers are asked to help stop this gun fair.
300 posters are one of the artists who performed at the Museum of Cruel Design in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collection called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it using the Darbe Package to the commercial area, which claimed "access to about a third of the bus stop ads on the planet."
Transportation for London was not satisfied with this poster "vandalism."
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collection.
According to Gavin Grindon, a student at the University of Essex, the artists are more interrogating every day and are looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the galleries.
Many artists act with activists in protest and start to realize that their art has to come out into the real world to have an effect on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster shows up in front of passengers on the subway.
In 24 hours, the International Amnesty video was watched over 100,000 Facebook and created by a free VCCP advertising agency, and the graphic designer and voice artist prepared it for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against arms fair ads - with empty space in the ExCel calendar - and he thought, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to escape from."
They played with a more realistic, subtle idea of corporate advertising, but "they decorated it with bright colors and animation, which is more remarkable."
"They have been very helpful to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Tom Davies of the Amnesty.
Now what we need is for the British government to act and prevent torture equipment from being illegally sold in front of our door.
Maybe the most creative art in the gun fair comes from the ExCEL inside, where the exhibitors sell fantastic cloaking products.
In a press statement, Saab showed the US Army order "AT4CS RS" thrown from the shoulder.
It has a "unique shape and a massive blow to the target by crossing the armor."
Whatever he's doing, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student homes
It's been 11 years since I moved to student homes as an uncaring 19-year-old, and I still believe in bruises and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of what I'm disturbing -- and the countless long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight golden rules.
Moving home can be watched from annoying to completely terrifying.
Discretion: where you're from, where you insist on losing the year, where you insist on Corbyn, and why you, frankly, don't love Marmite or hate Marmite, because he's really just gonna be in my room. "
Take a breath.
And let the others take one -- ask questions and show them the connection.
It will lead this conversation and if your eyelashes are on fire and they're squeezing fire extinguishers, it will help you separate the people you like from the people you won't talk to.
Leave some space for the people.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night places and public hangouts, but these are also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Interested: don't even think about starting college with a relationship
Interest turns are treated badly in college.
Your room may be a seclusion place, but a lot of dorms develop interrooms culture, and it's open to friendly, social and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will let you say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go for a while so that I can restore the energy I spent on you."
Try to sense that a friend of yours is tired of socializing and maybe instead of knocking on the door, try to text him.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A friend at the student dorm, if the door wasn't locked, he made a policy like he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Since you started college at the summit of the cooking contest, it's less weird and less 1950s to introduce yourself to people by playing with a plate of brownies, and now I've cooked something for you in our neighborhood, so smile while I ask you personal questions. "
Giving people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel compelled to talk and maybe tie your face to a sweet surprise.
To be honest, this is about you being a master cook.
A well-mixed poppy is gonna make people pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a very common crime in student homes.
To be honest, is it stealing someone's chicken, but stealing a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milkman twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself even if he's swimming in it.
It's uncomfortable for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand you, but try to deal with it more mature than my dorm friend, who put liquid soap in order to punish the one who stole the milk.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise to keep people from sleeping or studying.
It doesn't just mean being a decent person, but because you're the people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her neighbor next door to step down the drums a little because it's 3: 00 in the morning and she has a morning exam.
Their answers were to make the sound more clear.
When they finally closed at 5: 00 in the morning, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before she opened her music and locked the door and went to her own three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be so romantic if your future wife moved into the hallway with you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird that you had to misunderstand a fellow hallway and think that you had a future wife and hang out and see her every day and watch your mutual friends be taken prisoner?
Of course it's the heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the little guy and advise common sense.
When you realize that someone left their keys inside without locking their doors in a moment of joy, know that the line between joke and cruelty is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in security by hiding their stuff -- but never contaminate someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but don't stick your stuff on the ceiling more than twice.

His heart stopped while he was getting beautiful
The two children who lived in RIO DA JANEIRO, their mother Raquel Santos (28), applied to the plastic doctor last Monday to erase traces of laughter on the sides of the mouth.
After a while, her heart rate and breathing accelerated.
Then his heart stopped beating and he died.
Police are investigating whether she was involved in the death of a drug called "Potenay," which she used daily.
The real cause of death will be revealed after the autopsy.
Debora Azeredo, a close friend of Modelin's, told the Brazilian media that Santos, one of his two sons, seven and 13, was obsessed with plastic surgery.
Santos, who joined Moses do Brasil in the December of Brazil's most important beauty competitions, became the second.
Oil companies are officially down.
From 2014, oil prices began to fall, nearly 400 billion dollars of investment were postponed by the end of last year, while the most deep sea (Deepwater) oil search projects were suspended.
According to Wood Mackenzie's research, low oil prices have suspended $380 billion in oil and gas search / production, while production of millions of barrels from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa have been delayed in a wide geography.
"Company budgets are dramatically tightened," the report said in the summer of 2014, losing $115 per cent in 1.5 years and showing the price of oil at the lowest level of 12 years.
_
While raw oil prices were making new surprises every day, the last time was reduced to $30, seeing the lowest level of the last 12 years.
The research published by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie these days when oil falls to $15; "Is oil cheaper than water," reveals how the industry is affected by the decline of prices.
Last in July, Wood Mackenzie, who announced that falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 billion-dollar large energy investments, reveals where this number reached by the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 more major projects have been delayed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects have been suspended since 2014, when the oil collapse began.
These projects are worth about 400 billion dollars.
_
The research emphasises that low oil prices are "ruthless" to company plans is noted that the most affected projects are deep sea development projects.
The suspended projects are total of 27 billion barrels of raw oil, while 2.9 million barrels of oil production per day by 2025 is delayed.
According to the research, the final investment decision for most of the projects has been postponed between 2017 and later, while the initial production goals have shifted between 2020 and 2023.
"The majority of the 170 billion dollars are deep sea projects," the report stressed of a potential investment envisioned for the next five years.
And that's because the initial investment costs are too high.
"70 per cent of deep sea spending is primarily created by oil-laden projects in Nigeria, Angola and the United States Bay of Mexico."
According to research, countries with the most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90% of the delayed liquid reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, which have the largest amount of delayed gas reserves, are 85 per cent together.
Most of the natural gas that's waiting to go out here is in the deep sea, while it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as setting up a liquid gas (LNG) facility.
The most endangered companies are oil giants with commitments to each other in the Canadian oil sand and the Caspian Region, while companies are trying to adapt to the "longer" oil prices scenario.

There was a painting about four years ago: the United States and Europe brought embargo to the Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear programme, and the oil price was about 110 dollars, and Iran was debating how to cut oil exports without causing a sudden jump in prices.
And when we get back this week, we see a whole new scenario.
Oil prices have seen under $30 for the first time since 2004, which is the main reason for the production explosion in the United States, and the embargos applied to Iran are leaving.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
In the event Iran increases oil exports, more oil will be flowing into the oil market, which is already considered to be quite saturated.
And that could bring prices down to the bottom of the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose market share in Iran, would pump more oil and a price war could happen between Iran and S. Arabia.
As soon as the productions rise, Iran's main goal is to record that Asia's rapidly growing oil market is its former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials said in their earlier statements that they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day and produce a lot more in a while.
According to Reuters's map data, at least 13 of them are full or fully loaded while there are 22 large crude oil carriers (VLCC) outside Iran.
Iran is a country with the world's fourth largest proven oil reserves.
Iran still exports nearly 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries including Turkey.
Prior to the production, Iran's daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels per day.
"China-based global growth concerns increase low-directional pressure at the price of emtia, causing loss in oil prices to deepen," said Asun Göksu, a support-based research expert.
In China, the world's largest oil import, we see that oil losses have reached 20 per cent since Christmas, with concerns that oil demand will be reduced in parallel to economic slowdown.
In addition to the global value of the dollar and the impact of the global supply surplus problem, we can see prices in oil in the coming days under $30.
As long as we don't see permanent prices on the 32-33-dollar levels, the oil rise movement can be limited and increased low pressure.
At this point, it can be said that being seen under a critical $30 level of closure has a key role for the decline to continue.
In a situation like this, it shouldn't be a surprise to see loose spots going down to the 23.30-25.60 support zone.
Isham Sardouk: 'The Angel Age is over!'
While Victoria's Secret and WGSN have determined the world's fashion currents, why did you turn the course into Turkey?
- I'm always on the side of change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I've taken important positions there, too.
Meanwhile, I've been consulting Koton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the photon shaft.
I realized that there's everything you need to be a chain of stores in the world.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Will you be able to make it soon?
- Exactly.
Although it's already a young brand, it's already sold in 50 countries.
We make 50 collections a year, 15 separate episodes.
So there's everything a chain of stores has to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can respond to the needs of consumers in different geographics.
Now we open a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Do you have to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
Not because Europe's economic situation is fantastic.
But you open some stores for image.
You get a store in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you make money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the tarp, the other adds money, both necessary for a brand playing globalization.
So let's talk about trends...
- We have a very romantic, elegant season ahead of us.
Flying dresser clothes, soft tones, pink ones, white ones, red ones.
Facts...
We're going through a very difficult and cruel time, and the fashion world is always trying to add a little bit of happiness to life by carrying stylish, internal designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why in the new season, "Age of grace" comes back.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Karolina Kurkova.
I'm not just talking about your wonderful physics: she's so positive, so good!
When I was working, he sat next to me, feeding me apples and stuff, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, he was that sweet.
And you know what I'm talking about, I looked into it, and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
Karolina was beautiful, wasn't she?
But Adriana Lima impressed me with her beauty.
- Say yes, that sound!
That speech, that tone...
It makes you nervous after a while, and you say, "Sit aside and look nice and don't do anything else!"
It makes me nervous.
That's right, there are shocks like this.
I interviewed Candice Swanepeel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was terrified of her emptiness.
- Most of them are like this now.
New angels aren't what they used to be...
I remember when Gisele was...
Although it was pretty hard working with him.
He used to come backstage, smoke like a chimney.
And not because it's a Tiryaki.
No one can drink, he's the only one who can drink!
Make it Maksat'diva.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show, released two months ago, received the lowest ratings in its history.
Why do you think?
Like I said, it's over now, that legend is the time of beautiful angels.
I'm sorry, but who cares about Gigi Come?
What's so good about it?
Kendall Jenner, for instance, like wood...
It's okay. It's okay.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful was her face.
I want to use my right to protest here.
I interviewed him last year, and his face was pretty low...
- All that smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But in the '90s, he had such a beautiful face.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He had reached the end of his supermodel period.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was next door to me, and every morning I saw her without makeup.
Such a constant beauty can't be such elegance.
And Cara Delvingne?
- He's wasting himself.
Not every campaign.
People get sick of it.
There's no hunger for famous models or cellebrity like before.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
That's what we're going to do.
Because it's a trend.
Turkey letters from 25 writers
According to BBC Turkish, writers including the leaders of the International Association of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland have said that threats and physical attacks aimed at their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a common part of life.
Two attacks aimed at the daily Hurriyet in Turkey, including the arrest of the Koza group and the Vice News reporters, including investigations and arrests for journalists, were also considered to be a concern.
The mother had half a right to work.
"We believe that mothers are given half a job to restore hired labor."
"This could be a Trojan horse," he said, "We are concerned if this arrangement will prevent women from working for women."
Officer and working woman have passed through the commission with all-day talks, new rights planned to be delivered to workers after birth or adoption.
Six months after birth, part-time work, or free leave, and the most frequent issue in the commission talks of regulatory arrangements that led to part-time work until the child reached elementary school age was "hired labor."
"If you bring in the contract, we will be against you until the end," CHP İzmir MP Musa Cam said, stating that they had some concerns until the child went to elementary school.
"In part-time work, we have doubts about how to replace the female employee," Enis Baghdad, who attended the commission talks on behalf of Turkish-Business, said.
"This is why we will watch the developments in private employment offices," he said, adding that if the employment of hire is brought up again by this occasion, there will be new problems that will double the work of the contractor.
TİSK Secretary-General Bülent Pılar said that the law brought partial work for five years, while "Such long-term partial work is not in other countries."
And look at it this way.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, you have to think about the consequences of this application," he said.
The TOBB Consultant Ahmet Şakar said there would be trouble finding workers if the application passed.
"A compromise should be reached between workers and employers when regulated private employment offices," he said, saying there is no legislation on rules to be applied in part-time work.
Metin Feyzioğlu: We are not supporting
Feyzioğlu's statement is, "We are not joining this declaration, we cannot participate and support it."
Because there's no sentence criticism for the PKK.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, to the separatist terrorist organization, and you didn't put dust on it.
We don't see it serious, and we don't find it sincere, considering just the heavy statements that have been given to the state.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If those representing the state, the public officials, the security forces, have an illegal behavior in this framework, let's follow it.
When we say to the remnants of the mongrel that sympathize with separatists or separatists, "Do not destroy the state," they attack us as "separatist, fascist."
When we say, "This state must act according to the law, it must always uphold the law," they say, "You are divided."
We're bridges.
We're always responsible for telling the truth.

After the new neighborhood Yunus Emre Elementary, the Ankara State Conservatory entered the Piano section, but worked at the PTT for a while because of financial difficulties and increased its age.
In 1979, Feyman took the offer to work at the Night Club where he went to have fun with his friends.
Together with the Group Locomotive orchestra at the Feyman Night Club, he performed with repertoire consisting of Turkish Art music, Turkish Light music and the fashion of the era.

Bergen, who lost one eye in this attack and burned a large part of the body, was persuaded and released by Cengiz Özsef, the composer of the song "Who knows who," which made Kibariye famous after the treatment.
By 1985, the artist, who owned Özsef, performed at Izmir Pırlanta Pavyon, with his boss, made a demo tape called "Brother Destiny," and sent it to Yayr Kekeeva.
Kekeeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist who produced "Human Severse," the first professional longplay in Istanbul's music market, became famous for the end of 1986, when Burhan Bayar produced "Woman of Pain."
The album was well-liked by the record company in April 1987 and was awarded the Golden Records and Gold Tape with the title "The Most Sell the 1986 Album of Arabesque Woman Artist."

His hometown is buried in Mersin.
Bergen created a video film with 5 longplay and 129 songs on 11 tapes for 29 years of short life.

Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the poet of the country, was commemorated in the 114 year of her birth with the "Good for Born Nazim."
The event, organised by the Municipality of Housing, took place at the Beauty Cultural Center where the poet was named.
The famous poet's poems, theatre and film player were performed by Asian in the event of poetry and music listening.
He also accompanied the Asian with comments from the three Anatolian Music Society.
Nazim accompanied the Hikmet event with many artists.
These names include Ali Ekkiner Receiver, Erkoch Torun, Nedim Star and Zeynep Gönlight Star and Ziya Uzkurctors.
The event was held in Istanbul by the Nazim Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Vice President Rutkay Aziz and members met in Tarabya for the event of Nasim Hikmet's wife, Vera Tulyakova's daughter, son-in-law and grandson, Tarak Akan.
"Live like a tree and free / and free as a forest" will read poems and leave carnations in the sea.
The event, organised by the Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by songs by my humble Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Hikmet was born on 15 January 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was arrested over and over again for political thoughts and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
Their poems were translated over 50 and their works received many awards.
He died on 3 June 1963.
Bursa Nilufer Municipality has done special work for the 114 birthday of world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet.

They'll be deported by bicycle
However, refugees who are most Syrian will have to go back to Russia this time by turning negative 20 degrees of pedal.
A group of refugees flew from Russia to the north of the country to go from Murmansk to Norway because they were safer and cheaper in the summer.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow us to cross the border on foot, immigrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
That's why the Norwegian police ordered the repair of the abandoned bikes when they crossed the border.
EU crisis "3 billion euros to Turkey"
The crisis continues with the three billion euros pledged to the TÜRkiYE for refugees.
European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the funds to transfer to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, noting that the EU has to find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached three billion yet.
"This is a matter of the credibility of the EU, which is why it's important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26th, the date given earlier.
Italy is among countries with positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources say Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some of the Union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for a while.
Renzi continued to criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU in a harsh language at the last EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants.
"Renzi must stop blaming the EU."
"Renzi, who I love very much, is wrong to humiliate the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker implied Renzi was playing in public.
A billion euros promised to Turkey will be met by the EU budget.
Two billion euros will come from the budget of member countries.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Greek administration, for political reasons, has agreed to transfer its share of 2.3m euros to the EU budget to be used for support of Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used during 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to Russian official news agency Sputnik, the father Abdullah Kurdi reacted hard and said, "I cried for this cartoon, to be honest."
He said, "I felt so bad."
The father Kurdi, who expressed that they were expecting something positive from Charlie Hebdo, a French hiciv magazine that became a symbol of freedom of expression after his armed attack, said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was so upset about this cartoon.
He's a 2-year-old kid and he's dead.
Aylan, me and my family were supposed to respect Charlie Hebdo, but it was the other way around.
This magazine should respect the people that die.
The prophet has issued a disrespectful cartoon about our master.
They even published on God.
A small thing has been done to my child in the sight of God and the Messenger.
Kurdi, who lived in Erbil, called, "I call on the world and the humor magazine, everyone should respect the children who die."
It shouldn't hurt their families, it shouldn't hurt their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi, who lived in Canada, was also one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent'Riss' Souristeau, signed caricature, a 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who shot his body on the basement coast, has an illusion that when he grew up, he might be one of the molesters in Germany.
On the grounds that Muhammad published cartoons last year, the French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by radical religions killed 12 people, became the focus of the debate again because of the cartoon he was talking about Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon was portrayed by traffickers who were chasing women and calling immigrants, especially in the city of Cologne, Germany, as in women's abuse during Christmas celebrations.
The cartoon that causes different reactions to social media is actually part of a four-square column.
The column says "France is not this," and many read that the growing refugee hostility, along with the other values lost in France, is criticised.
On the other hand, the cartoon still led to a lot of people accusing Charlie Hebdo of racism.
In a number of published last year, Charlie Hebdo criticised France's reluctance to open its doors to immigrants while praising Germany, which agreed to buy 800,000 refugees.
The cartoon said, "He was very close to his goal," while the ad poster said, "Two children's menu for one price."
'Autopsy to the Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany '
According to a weekly report on Der Spiegel's website, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided that 10 people who have lost their lives in the attack should be brought to Germany.
The funeral of the deceased will be welcomed by a German Air Force aircraft today or tomorrow at the country and the airport.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Agency (BKA) for Identification Specification Commission (BKA), which conducted forensic procedures, go to countries where the incident occurred for citizens of Germany, who died in accidents or attacks in normal conditions, and do their identification and autopsies there.
But Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time it would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Office applied to Turkish authorities to identify the dead and perform the autopsy in Istanbul, but Turkish officials did not accept that proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack continue treatment at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has lost her life.
Meiksins Wood, a known political theorist and socialist historian, had been particularly important in his work on the origins of capitalism.
The works of Latvia Meiksins Wood, born in New York in 1942, are also published in Turkey: Exclusion -- the Arabian culture of capitalism -- the Origin of capitalism -- the Sermaye Empire -- back to Marx.
Restricted swimming pool for defector men
According to the German media, the municipality will abolish the ban if the message of the curfew is understood by refugees.
Markus Schnapka, a social agency worker who noted that the municipality does not want to punish criminals for the behavior of several people, told the WDR that they have informed the rest of the citizens in three languages about the values that are important in Germany.
Schnapka, who has recorded the value of the gender equality that Germany cares about, added that the municipality will punish all kinds of attacks and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg has been cancelled due to the possibility that the harassment scandals in Cologne could happen in the upcoming carnival crossings.
The city has announced that the carnival gate has been cancelled because there is no guarantee that harassment will not happen.
What are the benefits of cooking in the steam?
The steaming technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals in nutrients is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steaming is one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, making metabolism stronger and easier to digest.
The bacteria and microbes found in nutrients in this method that completely eliminates problems such as indigestion are also completely dying.
The protein in the food, cellulose and starch, are completely melting with this technique, which allows the food to be softer.
Steaming in low pressure is done in a pot with steam caps or steam machines.
In high pressure, the amount of water used and the time of cooking is short.
This can be shown as the best example of cooking in a steamed pot.
To cook food like vegetables on diet menus, especially, you have to wash the vegetables and then put them in the filter and wait for them to glide.
A deep pot is filled with water by one third and the steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The pot is left half-shut.
So the vapor can be easily removed from the pot.
The fire of January is first brought to the highest level, the boiling of water is provided, and then the temperature of the stove is reduced to a lower level, and then it gets a constant heat.
Vegetables and nutrients, cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes in the steam, are controlled by a fork after well-cooked.
The baked vegetables are taken from the stove and served on plates.
In the steam cooking technique, the appearance of food, color and smell of food doesn't change, so this method is healthy.
Food tastes the same.
So the quality and flavor of the food will be intact.
It is also one of the most economical cooking methods that is steaming, and the loss of food is minimal.
The vegetables that are cooked in the steam provide a more lively and vibrant feast for those who eat with their appearance.
Especially since this method used often in diet dinners is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The alien's "final" album
Knowing you're going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, making the bed of death an artistic domain in your video...
Things like this might seem too extreme for us Earthlings.
I call it Earthlings because I'm among those who believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our world from another corner of the universe; now he's back to his homeland; that's what happened.
He came because there was an inspiration not only for Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, but for all Earth artists.
He's done his duty properly.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 $5 / 5
He probably fed off Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is this something that I'm an alien," and he got involved by saying "Space Oddity."
Actually, he didn't; he always went a few steps ahead.
Many have found ways to lose because of him.
Both musicians and listeners...
It would be unfair to say, "It was just music," aside from his interest in plastic art and acting and all.
His characters, which he wrote from song to song, mean an artistic integrity to me, his messages, his innovation, his coffin, and his disco.
I can't call myself the ancestor of glam rock or the cousin of punk...
If I remember it that way, what about those avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's been hiding as love since he was a child?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word meant until these years when we were chewing the word "icon."
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a human being.
It was a body.
And it appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
That body left this world two days after its 26 studio album "Blackstar."
He tried to train us to go with the Blackstar and Lazarus that we heard before the album was released.
We were thinking, "He's old now, he's talking about death," and he knew everything.
One last game...
Other than the great Blackstar and Lazarus, which are behind the message and emotion load of the album, but it has been re-recorded for this album, "Sue (Or In A Season of Crime)," when the number of songs we know with "A Pity She Was A Whore" was released four.
The rest of you, "Girl Loves Me," "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are very good songs.
When we look all over it, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's made of such sincere, sudden feelings, "Blackstar..."
No death, no "deal with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
It's the "The End" of a music life, which is a masterpiece all over again.
Turkey was targeted in the Sultanahmet attack
German Federal Police Department President Holger Munch announced Tuesday's attack on Sultanahmet Square, which killed 10 German citizens.
Munch said the target of the attack was Turkey, not German citizens.
_
However, Munch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, saying, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
The number of people who went to Syria to join ISIS from Germany has been reduced, Münch said, and many have returned from the war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we shouldn't be keeping in custody right now," Munch said, expressing that this is a major challenge for security units.
Munch demanded that the co-ordination between police agencies be improved in Europe and more closely connected.
Turkish officials have stated that the live bomb that organised the Sultanahmet attack is a member of Syria and ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has yet to identify the attacker.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated her 40th year with a concert series, fascinated her lovers with her concert last night at Volkswagen Arena.
The final ring of the concert series held in July was held in Volkswagen Arena on January 15th and 16th.
Aksu took all his listeners to a 40-year journey from yesterday to today at the concert.
Aksu, as well as the love songs that touched our personal lives, sang their songs on social issues that are closely interested in our country and our world.
Aksu, who said she was going to say good-bye to stage life after making the concerts she promised, upset her fans.
Sezen Aksu came up with a separate story in every piece against the loved ones who filled Volkswagen Arena at the "Selfish Years" concert.
Each story, show, light and stage show led to different times.
In the last part of the unforgettable concert, a video show was also performed, including the Istanbul paintings of the Revolution Erbil.
Aksu also hosted them by performing the first video recorded by her fans.
In Ankara and Istanbul, the bread was raised by 25 cents
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents, starting to sell at $1.
Earlier, in December, Foods, Agriculture and Agriculture Minister Faruk Çelik and Trade Minister Bülent Tuffenkci made statements that "There is no raise."
However, in Ankara, the capital sold 250 grams of bread yesterday at $1.
"There was no raise, the decision of the recipe two years ago has begun to apply," said Halil İbrahim Balci, president of the Turkish Federation of Bakers on the 25-cent increase that came to bread.
"This was a recipe decision taken two years ago."
The Association of Esnaf Rooms set this description two years ago.
It's a price in Turkey.
So there was no new increase and no price increase.
But because of the competition, in some areas in Ankara, the shopkeeper sold for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for $1.
The tradesman who trusted his counter, his bread, he was not lowering prices, so they have to apply $1 for competition.
No increase or increase.
They're applying the unapplied price.
"In the first half of 2016, the kilogram price of bread will definitely not exceed $5 and if we don't have a lot of trouble, we will complete the year with this price."
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for 1.25 pounds.
This time, the Terror has found Burkina Faso blood.
Twenty-three people in 18 different countries have lost their lives in the attack aimed at a luxury hotel known to be preferred by foreigners and United Nations officials in Burkina Faso.
Al Qaeda's North African branch took over the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIS launched a terrorist act in Cakarta, the most crowded Muslim country in the world, with 250 million inhabitants.
In a day-to-day bombing and armed attack on the Starbucks branch on a busy street with foreign ambassadors, luxury hotels and stores, a Canadian and an Indonesia lost their lives.
Indonesia officials said the attackers were inspired by the massacre of Paris on 13 November.
The British BBC television security correspondent Frank Garner noted that this act has been part of a frightening trend that has shown itself in many cities around the world lately.
The United States was recently hurt by terrorist acts.
At the beginning of December last, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by an ISIS sympathizer in San Bernardino, California, United States.
The San Bernardino attack that rocked the United States
Following the live bomb attack of 10 German tourists in Sultanahmet, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also reminded of terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, "We had two major attacks in Paris."
If we say so, then he'll have a terror...
We used the phrase "without backing down."
ISIS has left Whatsapp talking to Alrawi
According to a new report, the terrorist organisation uses its own chat vehicle to communicate independently from talks such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One's report, the organisation is taking advantage of a new message application to communicate among itself.
This Android app, called "Alrawi," is being distributed and uploaded through an APK file.
The application allows the organisation to text and share media with itself in code.
A flash move from ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the application remains "primitive" against popular applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
For now, it is unknown how powerful the encryption is.
ISIS had previously conducted its entire communication through Telegram app, which allowed it to send messages through the encrypted link.
However, Telegram uncovered channels that the ISIS members spoke to.
Furthermore, the US administration demands the application developers to place back doors on their applications.
So the organisation is now using its own solutions instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram's encryption.
UAEA: Iran nuclear satellite to the agreement

Iranian President Hasan Ruhani announced that he congratulated the removal of sanctions after the nuclear agreement between six world countries and Tehran.

How should a semester vacation be considered?
We asked Murat Aydın, the student coach, how should students evaluate the semester vacation?
A semester vacation should not only be thought of as rest, entertainment, television and computer time.
The holiday of the semester is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new education period and review the past.
A semester vacation called empty time is also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skill and hobby.
Make a half-year evaluation list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
I assure you, you will enjoy this and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about what a productive semester should be for students who prepare for the YGS-LYS.
Because the most important questions that come to us from friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are, "How do we evaluate this period, do we solve a lot of questions or do we have some issues missing?"
To answer them and spend a productive period, first, let's enter our writing with advice to friends who are preparing for the test.
The preparation process should be a process starting from the ninth grade, but we're trying to complete it more in the last year, which makes us more efficient, efficient and more accurate for the last year.
The senior student has to conduct his studies together, as well as his exams.
Although the graduate student who completed the school has taken the test at least once (YGS-LYS) and experienced it, it is critical for him the year he will be rescheduled as a graduate student.
Because most graduate students and their family see O as their last chance, and that creates a bigger stress.
Studying is what the student does because he doesn't like it, because he feels compelled, and that's why it's usually the last time he leaves it, but for students who do it regularly, make it a habit, it's a complete mission, and it's always a plan for what to do.
Now we have a half-year vacation ahead of us, and we need to take it the best way.
And for that, we must have a plan that will ensure that we manage time well.
Study on a half-year vacation:
Everyone has to plan for their own condition first.
The first term has been dealt with, what's left of it; it has to plan the day, the week, and the 15 days.
In this period, there has to be a recurrence of the subject and a question solution.
At the same time, students who aren't too short can solve an average of 1-2 test tests.
Handle your shortcomings: Studies show that 75 per cent of what people learn in a week, 66 per cent in a day, 54 per cent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to avoid forgetting is to do it again.
Students who make a lot of mistakes in particular from past issues must weigh on their overall rework.
First identify your shortcomings and plan them day by day, place them every day and make sure they're done with it.
This planning will comfort you both in both academic and psychological ways.
And make sure you make the most mistakes when you put the issues in your plan.
Because later on, you won't have such a long-term holiday.
Configure Question Solutions:
It's important to solve questions as well as repetition.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we're doing, but we can see from the turns that we're taking through the question we've solved.
Don't forget to put a specific number of questions in every day.
The number of questions you're going to solve that day may change according to your work; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions on a day of heavy work, but at least we have to do a certain number of questions in order to see how much we learned about that day.
Solve Test Exams:
Another study you're going to do on a half-year vacation is to solve the test exams.
Although all the issues are not over, at least you can do the lesson test solutions.
Let's say you've done a great deal of Turkish class; you can solve Turkish trials with 40 questions.
And make sure you keep working while you're doing it.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in the first 60 minutes, then your next goal is to be able to solve them in a few minutes, if possible.
Vacation and Hobi Plan:
Vacation means, of course, not only study; you have to spend a few days on vacation, rest and hobbies.
A holiday period that will only be spent studying will prevent you from resolving and resting.
Therefore, there must be some special times in your plans that you can spare yourself.
Reading, watching TV, surfing on the Internet could be in your plans, most importantly, how much time you have to spend.
And I have a little advice for friends who say I didn't make it through the first semester.
If my first semester didn't go very well, I couldn't work very hard, and if you think my shortcomings were too much, this semester's vacation is a big opportunity for you.
But first of all, you have to decide and believe it.
In the 2009-2010 season in Turkey's football superleague, the goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now you answer the question you're asking, is it over, and you're going to the locker room, or the game is still going on, and you've got a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "We'll look at the next games," a classic comment by a defeated football coach or players.
Now all you have to do is leave the past and look ahead, not walk, but run.
So let's get this straight:
1) Preferably plan a semester off,
2) Go over what you know and do it again,
3) Handle your shortcomings,
4) Solve questions to reinforce the subject,
Solve test exams, 5)
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new era,
8) Spend time on yourself, your hobbies and the things you enjoy,
9) Spend time with your family and friends,
Set time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concert, travel, picnic etc.).
'Kervan 'is on its way
The founder of Kervan, Shinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, each one of the average 1,000 square metres of stores and one of Turkey's largest 'home' stores, put home Sweet Home into Kervan, 17, 25 stores abroad.
With the recent operation completed trade records, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
"Now we will continue the big store with Kervan, and the smaller store with Home Sweet Home," Shinasi Demirel said, saying that there is still no caravan store abroad.
"The caravan will open abroad too," he said.
With the merger of Home Sweet Home, which was $50 million in 2015, and Kervan, which was 90 million, there was a retail chain with 140 million coins and production.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 caves in 35 provinces, is 45,000 square metres.
25 of the stores belong to the main company.
There are about 500 jobs in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores abroad in 25 countries, and the total sales area is 6,500 square metres and the number of employees is 320 people.
"We are from Mardinus, and we entered this sector in 1998," said Kadir Kalaycioğlu, chairman of the Home Sweet Home Board of Directors with his partner, Alev Pakden, who worked for production, exports and stores.
From the beginning, we'd come up with a brand with the support of the Shainasi gentlemen.
Şinasi Bey is the TRT of this sector.
And we learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step at the store when he gave us his White Central store.
I've already been working with the caravan like a strategic partner, not a rival.
"Now with this merger, a very serious synergy will emerge."
Kalaycioğlu announced that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, weighing in the Middle East, and that they also began exports to China last month.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed on a chain with 200 stores.
"From now on, as Kervan, we will develop large stores abroad with Home Sweet Home."
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed the Liga.net website on the issue, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we sold the factory."
"As soon as we put them on sale, all the real buyers suddenly disappeared," he said, adding that there is no buyer.
"We have set about 200 million dollars," Moskalevsky said, referring to the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia.
Roshen, who produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and marshmallows a year, belongs to one of the world's largest producers and Ukrainian President Petro Porocenko.
Star Holding became Pladis abroad
Star Holding merged global companies operating in the biscuits and chocolate sectors he bought under the name "Pladis."
A new 5.2 billion-dollar food giant was born with the merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulker brands.
"Being a global company has been our goal since the beginning," he said at a meeting of global companies within the Star Holding.
Murat Ulker has released live from Periscope, the sale of 335 million pounds
This company, founded 72 years ago, is now moving to become a global, global company in a cookie chocolate candy business called Star Holding.
In the meantime, we developed biscuits and chocolate sugars, and we developed from peracendede to packaging to real estate, personal care and various industrial branches.
77 factories operating in 14 countries, we're at thousands of sales points with 300 brands.
"The more we look at the possibilities in our family, the more we want to focus on chocolate chocolate candy, focus on our main business, and become global in this field; we are reorganized for this," he said.
Ulker's father Sabri Bey's life story
We're reevaluating our company structure, reorganizing.
We've divided the world into areas.
And we've divided these areas into our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tüttüth, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, K.Africa and Turkish republics.
Mohamed Elszy is our global Godiva business, as well as the American continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, Continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ulker, who I can call quality and innovation guru, will take global responsibility on his own field, while Cem Karakash will help me manage the business.
China, Russia will be part of the region where we will build and develop South East Asia.
Murat Ulker sold shares at SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the world in every bite," Murat Ulker said, "Our global company we set up to do so is called Pladis."
"Where you invented Pladis, in fact, that name has no special meaning," he added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the Pleiades team star, which means "Ulker."
So we translated Ulker into the global at the cost of it.
"We have begun to create synergy in innovation," StarHolding Board Vice President Ali Ulker stressed and added, co-operation with labs in different countries.
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, and we have gathered these teams together to obtain certain synergies so far in working on an AR-GE platform.
We have 27 Ar-GE centers under the Pladis.
The biggest of them is in Turkey and England.
Over 300 of our AR-GE experts work here.
Sinergy studies have already begun to give results.
The drama of Digestives (Nibbles), which was produced in Ulker and began exports to England, is produced in Silivri in Ulker's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: marks are different, but products are the same as Ulker Krispi Scratched.
We have recently adapted Jacob's Crinklys products to Turkey, which have been developed in England, and we have acquired a good taste under the name Ulker Krispi caterpillar.
Laviva, who we all know closely, met with consumers in America today.
The Call of Duty series has crossed the 250 million border
This series, which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games carved into the game world with gold letters, seems to be unforgettable for many years.
In particular, the newly released sales numbers are evidence of how legendary we need to find them.
Activision, who holds the series's licenses, showed 250 million copies of the number of sales he shared by the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company that shared the number of sales of the entire series has been able to sell 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
And most of that number is, of course, the Black Ops 3 game, so we're not entirely wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has been elected President General once again
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected president at the usual board.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received the game of 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, became the president who came back.
248 of the votes used have been annulled.
After the outcome was announced, the partisans rejoiced.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The board completed its work to meet at 10: 00 on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroğlu briefly said:
We'd like to play games here, to be sung in derivatives.
But the point we're coming from isn't heartbreaking.
There is a fact of Turkey that cannot be ruled.
The atmosphere is clouding all of this.
The pessimistic painting is because of those who rule the country.
As CHP, no matter where terror comes from, no matter how it comes, we're against it.
Terror is a crime of humanity, and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with wisdom, with knowledge, with wisdom.
Of course we fight, we want no one to bleed their noses.
How is it different from the photos in Syria, Lebanon, the pictures in the Southeast?
Sitting at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
The power is responsible for the blood, the tears, the deaths.
In 2002, they delivered the country with zero terrorism, and today there's a Turkey that turns into a bloodbath.
Who's responsible for all this?
Our city of taxi driver in Diyarbakır?
What's he paying for, Turkey?
We're going to participate in intimate meetings about changing the laws of impact, and we're going to pass our thoughts.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal views.
I say, "Let's change the coup spirit."
The intellectuals of this country have announced their thoughts, so their homes are being raided at dawn, taken into custody.
There are aspects that we disagree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "Eat the government's bread and antagonize the state."
And I'd like to ask him, why didn't they think when those who ate the government's bread and took advantage of all the resources of the state robbed the state?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will prepare for the fourth great revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will surely bring freedom into this country.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, whatever they do, no matter how heavy the cost, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm giving you a clear call, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind coup law, hiding man didn't throw the coup mentality out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you the tip a medal for higher service.
What blow are you talking about?
He's totally against the public.
Party officials have listed the other three revolutions: the first great revolution is to end the reign and the establishment of the Republic; the second great revolution is to go from a single-party period to a party period; the third revolution is to move to social democracy with the Bülent Ecit...
The president has qualifications, duties.
Article 103 has the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If one person came out and made this promise, he'd do it to his death.
Because honor and honor cannot be discussed for us.
The man with the dictatorship means honor and honor to you.
What do you understand about honor and honor, why did you take that oath?
What do you mean by honor and honor?
That's what I want to know.
The concept of honor and honor in a religious man is the crown.
Their intention is not to abolish coup law, but to determine coup law.
It's not enough. They want the presidential system.
What kind of president is the boss's presidential system?
Why refuse the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who will order will do what they need.
Does parliament work well in Turkey?
No, it doesn't work.
If we bring freedom democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they strengthened the coup law.
İzmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the president, failed to participate because he failed to collect the signature of the 128 delegates required for the nomination.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't run on current conditions."
Lawmakers in the board room have noted that the former CHP leader Deniz Baykal is sitting in the bleachers with the parties, with the party council (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the members of the honor board.
İstanbul MP Gülay Yerkçci sat early and sat next to President Kılıçdaroğlu instead of sitting in a place reserved for lawmakers.
The meeting with Yalova MP Muharrem İnçdaroğlu was one of the topics discussed in the council tower.
He said he was offered a PM membership, and he refused to accept it.
However, the general central sources have claimed that the request for a meeting came from Thin and that PM membership was not proposed.
"No one can learn from this central source, the content of the meeting from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan," he said on Twitter.
"How can I know about two people seeing each other?"
He was just saying, "He's gone."
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the press.
On the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Council," the party council marked its municipalities (PM).
Kılıçdaroğlu went to his house after the assembly speech and started working for the PM list.
While preparing Kılıçdaroğlu's key list of 100 members, Jacob Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakash, who did not apply to the PM, has been informed that he will phone 13 MYK members outside Seyhan Erdoğan, who are once again nominated for the PM.
Kılıçdaroğlu could point to a key list of 100 people, as well as another limited list.
The 21-point conclusion declaration adopted unanimously at the CHP Board has been requested to remove the striations on the European Local Management Agreement, which has been brought up by the DTK's autonomy debate, to increase the level of power sharing in the ground.
The declaration also included "ending the party state order," "establishing a transparent and accountable legal state."
Co-Chair of the EC Party, Selsuk Özdağ, İdris Baluken of the HDP, followed by Süssar Demirel of the MHP.
EC Party Özdağ and the EC Party delegation left the room after Kılıçdaroğlu strongly criticised President Erdogan.
"I looked and saw that he was missing his critical dose, and I couldn't possibly accept it."
"If I don't burn, how will darkness come to light" with a banner written in the hall with pictures of arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gul?
The board began in the morning with Group comment and Ahmet Kaya songs.
The message sent by Diyarbakır Bar President Tahir Emissary's wife, Türkan Emissary, who died in an armed attack, received great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsim and his father Sami Elvan joined the board.
Kılıçdaroğlu, whatever price it takes, was the most applauded part of the speech that he said they would have democracy "to die."
The CHP, which has collected 52 committees so far -- 34 usual, 18 extraordinary -- collected its 53rd largest council in Ankara Arena yesterday.
The turnout was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHP people in the 12,000-seat room.
However, there was no enthusiasm for the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued while the Kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall.
There was no sign of discipline in the hall on the EC Party board.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu spoke, there was great activity in Arena's field area.
Obviously, CHP people who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling party managers and journalists about themselves.
A CHP manager tried to explain that this situation is not a bad thing, with words like "better than a party meeting in Korea or in the Soviet Union than a bunch of feigning partisans standing up and sitting still."
The CHP board is different from the EC Party or the MHP board.
Only the presidents talk at these parties.
In the CHP, the council turns into a platform where party problems are discussed.
When the number of parties wanted to talk on the board yesterday was too much, the Court President Murat Karayasçin had trouble arranging time.
There was a distance from the comments, "The country is going bad in faces and languages," but you can change the course with the painting coming out of this room. "
All CHP said, "He must do something," but there was no consistent and strong response to the question, "What should he do?"
The impact of this was that there would be no choice in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu came to the stand, we waited for the journalists to answer the question, "What should he do?"
First, Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question, "What's going on?"
He noted the issue of arrested journalists, what happened to academics because of the declaration, what happened in the Southeast, the impasse of foreign policy.
The CHP has responded to its "unreligious party," such as "support coup," "party of elitists."
As for the "what to do" phase, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to put out "strategy."
He stressed that it could overcome all these problems with stronger democracy and more justice.
He made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work at any cost until we bring democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
One final note is to remind you that the CHP has taken care of the "organization" issue as of the 53rd Council, and that you are now able to collect non-problem committees.
Meanwhile, for 900 journalists who were told to follow the board, the card was printed, but the participation of journalists in the courtroom was not at that level.
Media companies' Ankara representatives were not as eager to follow the board as they were on the EC Party board.
Self-management has been asked for life.
The indictment against seven defendants, three of Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor's Office, was adopted by the 4th Heavy Criminal Court.
Following the orders and calls of top leaders of the PKK / KCK terrorist organisation, Diyarbakır, İstanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağar have been quoted as "self-management" in some districts and neighborhoods.
The indictment called for illegal action from the leaders of the organisation and youth and women's construction has increased in the long-marked arms and rocket attacks against citizens' houses, businesses and vehicles in Diyarbakır's Sur, Bagar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts.
ISIS and the dissidents clashed, and our outpost was shot.
The conflict between the Duke of Syria, the Black Mezra, and the anti-opposition groups in the Black Bridge village of Kilis, continues to escalate recently among the Fetih Army.
The sound of weapons and mortars fired during clashes between ISIS and the dissidents at the close of the border is heard by Turkey.

The couple said, "After all, there is no guarantee for tomorrow."
John Robinson, who works in a chain of stores, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant for a dermatologist, said they'd be in charge on Monday, even though they were millionaires.

FedEx's income is complicated, the financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its profit estimates all year due to the reduction of demand for cargo services and increased cost in ground services.
The company also said he plans to hire about 55,000 seasons of workers for holidays.
Last year at this time, FedEx announced that he would receive 50,000-season workers for holidays.
Nearly 2.5% fell in pre-opening procedures 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening car.
FedEx Corp said the financial year to end in May is expected to profit between $10.40 and $10.90 per year, which is less than 20 cents compared to previous estimates.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84 based on the research done by FactSet.
The average rate will be 4.9% higher on January 4th, and the land transport of heavy or large packages shows the possibility that it will fall despite the high drafts that will begin in November.
According to the company, the cost cuts are still expected to be higher than the previous year, due to higher income and growth of e-trade.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has performed a solid performance, despite the lack of economic conditions particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS, which says the UPS planned to receive the same number of 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers last year.
During the three-month period of August 31st, FedEx made $692 million by increasing his income by 6% compared to the previous year.
The profit per share was 2.42 dollars per share, leaving $2.44 behind the estimates of 12 analysts discussed by Zacks Investment Research.
The income increased by 5%, $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx received a coup last year from the decline of international priority transport, which led to the recession of income in the Express unit.
However, the explosion on the online exchange raised the results of FedEx Ground Services.
In the last quarter, ground service revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high cost in internal insurance.
In high labor costs, as the cargo business fell, the express unit saw high income due to high base rates.
In the pre-opening process about an hour before the opening, FedEx stock was reduced to $150.15 with $3.85 or 2.5% downfall.
They closed Tuesday at 17% below the record level of 11% and 11 June for the year.
In their most anticipated meetings for years, federal reserve politicians decided that it was time to spend two days around a 27-foot Honduras mamas table this week to increase interest rates almost ten years ago.
The two-story conference room, located in a wing of the central bank, will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues hold the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two missions from Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Buhran, the Fed leaders have admitted that there is a third custody that has not been written: financial balance.
And this third act could be an X factor far too close to predict whether the US economy, which will be announced on Thursday, has been ready to start cutting unique stimulant support from the relatively short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data show that the economy has grown strongly, the latest escalation of global financial markets can already make careful Fed officers, reference federal funds interest -- less than a quarter of a cent -- more than a quarter -- more than a quarter of it and more productive about adding vulnerability.
"Obviously, the business market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they've seen," said Stipel Nicolaus & Co's chief economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
The Fed has no consensus on what to do, and it causes itself to fluctuate in financial markets.
Half the economists Bloomberg's been seeing recently have been waiting for an increase of interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to stand by with the main indicator, which shows that it could only be an increase of about 30%.
This may indicate a decline in the stock market if politicians do not ease their impact by promising another increase may be on the way if the Fed increases the rate.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial index average rose to 16.599.85 with 228,89 points or 1.4% increase.
"The ratio of the increase's Fed policy makers has been triggered by expectations that they will hold steady this week," Moody's Capital Market Research Group chief economist John Lonski said.
He said, "It would be amazing if the Fed could increase the rates right now."
"They would have to take a long year to calm down the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts suggested that an increase in proportion to the rise of the fog curtain on when the Fed will act could calm the financial markets.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be on his way to increase this month's rate by 0.25%; that would be a small step to strengthen the United States' recovery in order to slow down the money conditions.
Yellen said that despite the liberals' complaints about the need for a more economic process, this year's rate increase is expected in spring and early summer.
Although the speed of creating business decreased in August, growth in the labour market was released this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years, and approached the level of full employment by the Fed.
The salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to monitor under the central bank's annual goal of 2%, Fed politicians said the temporary impact of the reduced oil prices is a significant reason.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy "can deal with higher rates and needs it despite the difficulty in the business market."
But at the end of last month, financial markets around the world began to shake after China went on a continuation in the currency.
The Dow Jones industrial index average dropped about 16% of the record level in May because of the fear of a slow Chinese economy pulling global growth down.
The market somehow jumped back when it was almost 10% below Dow's high level in May.
The market turmoil for the Fed policy makers makes the time to calculate when the interest rate will increase more complicated.
"In the past few weeks, it may have been a little narrow in this meeting with the lack of news about economic weakness and the lack of financial markets in the Chinese economy," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research partner at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least another month to manage these effects better.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact in the US economy will be, and they don't have almost any data to rely on further history of developments in China," he said.
The health of the global economy is not one of Fed's primary concerns, so it shouldn't be a factor in technical snowboarding processes.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank had a huge impact over the last few years.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 he could "reduce the monetary expansion" triggered by Fed's worldwide market tremors.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials may not only follow developments in other places but also consult other central bank managers and experts to read the global economy better.
The process of making decisions by the global strategist of the entity management company Envestnet Inc, Zachary Karabell, said that the process of decision is "a talent more than science."
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that Fed has been overreacting to financial market movements that don't seem to be linked to economic foundations.
Lacker, a member of the political producer Federal Open Market Committee, pressured for increased rates, cited his 1998-99 decisions as an example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for US growth," the financial crisis in Asia led to a 0.75% cut of the show during three meetings, "Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officers took these cuts back.
Adam S. Posen, one of the previous members of the British Central Bank rating committee, said "Fed should only put financial balance concerns in front of major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said that his last escalation doesn't approach that level.
He said that you don't really want to be afraid to go to a rate increase because the markets are too tight, Peterson International Institute of Economics President Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and doesn't mention financial balance, and I don't think they should act that way until this changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market / warehouse opened in 1997 and belonged to LAX-C.
It's a total Thai market, which is often referred to as Thai Costco and also sells to the LAX-C public.
Yeah, it's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
Sunday / storage is a one-stop store; many fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asia and Thailand snacks, kitchen furniture, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
If you want to buy motor oil, there's even the auto part.
The store is huge, and it could take an hour to go through all their corridors.
If you get hungry all this shopping, grab some food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal food part of the store (well, calculated) is next to the crates, and they have a variety of ways to get it out.
What's he stockpiling: do you want something from Thailand?
Probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold together.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat rack is very comprehensive, so is the fish - the workers behind the counter are cleaning the fish and making filets, even if you want them to fry it.
In most parts of the store, there is a large freezer, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, all duck, fish, cow blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who's shopping: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
There are both shopping cars and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Found: Fresh monthong durian near the exit stand.
Where is the store a few blocks from Philippe The Original, downtown Los Angeles and Chinatown.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking space, sharing it with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is too busy, it's not usually hard to find a parking lot.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatri Society encourages healthy food during its breastfeeding period
The Brazilian pediatric organisation SPRS sought a shocking way to address the importance of healthy nutrition in the process of testing and feeding women.
Human milk is made of a variety of proteins, oil, vitamins and carbs, which provides babies with all the nutrients necessary to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to energy surplus requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase daily calories to around 500 calories.
However, recent research shows that the food supplements that mothers need are not limited only to calories.
According to a new study led by Texas Baylor Medical College Professor Robert Waterland, healthy feeding of pregnant women affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, malnourishment has been determined to affect the child's immune system in a negative way.
Seven's Sunrise, despite Nine's efforts to take over the leadership at the Today Show, continues to dominate the ratings.
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra in order to overthrow Liberal's leadership failed to provide a ratings increase for Today.
After Tony Abbott fell Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was performed in the national capital.
The Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, is trapped among the weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance problem doesn't make much difference to the Australian audience, but in response to the 339,000 numbers of Today, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals.
Today had a slight increase in ratings on Monday (317,000) compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the number was still behind Thursday (343,000)
Today's been catching up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the Today average was 318,000 in exchange for the 330,000 numbers of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By today's September, the Sunrise average is 349,000 in exchange for the 314,000 numbers of Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more affecting his people this morning than parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the beginning of 800 Words of Erik Thomson, the star of the former Packed to the Rafters.
With the two children of a new widow, the new drama of a new father deciding to move to the seaside in New Zealand has reached a very impressive average with 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rebecca Gibney, the star of Rafters.
Last night's result was a ringing "yes."
Seven's X Factor protected its power with 1,136 million viewers, Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000) easily defeated.
Seven Two Trackers mixed up their night fortune with Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new information contest (1700-1730) reached the average 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (1730-18: 00), the number jumped to 623,000 viewers -- enough for a small win against Eddie Mc Guire's Hot Chair (613,000).
The first half-hour of Monday Night Tracking-Australia reached the average 520,000 viewers, and in the second half hour it rose to 720,000.
The hot seat had 620,000 averages.
Following Australia's ratings drop on the second night made Nine think that at 5: 30, the Hot Chair would have the upper hand.
The pursuit was an altercation to the Million Dollar Minute, which did not take a tooth to the Mc Guire show.

The last three of us think that Single Sam Wood is the perfect guy -- but who is he going to pick?
Did the secret come out...?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly discovered who would win the Bachelor.
At the end of Sam Wood's Single Program, the woman he was going to choose was in great secrecy.
And the three remaining girls are doing their best not to tell us who the last rose field is.
But the day before three people fell in two, if we checked Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski, they might have given us a clue about who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
In a lyrical language, three women explained why Wood was perfect; they said why they wanted to be his partner by striking his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude.
But their answer to "Who should take Wood's last rose if it's not you?" could contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood but themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
"From the moment I came home," Jeavons-Fellows said, "I felt they were compatible by reading Sarah's energy and Sam's energy, and that's what I thought during the program."
"Sarah is very practical, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a very good couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made Wood think he was "the right person."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game -- I'm completely committed to him now."
Without it, when asked who Wood could choose, it was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equals."
The Bachelor is broadcast on Ten at 7: 30 on Wednesday.
First broadcast: Sarah is the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarrd Hayne had several options for where he was going to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and after last year's impressive open practice day, a lot of other teams approached him.
But Hayne San Francisco chose 49ers and his coach Jim Tomsur, and that seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches placed Hayne on the bench Tuesday because he lost his performance in the Australian ragbi league, as in the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsur believed this man and gave Hayne another chance to play a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
After the game, the compass continued to show its true color to the dressing room.
Instead of insulting the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
The tomato was also openly supportive of Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers team correspondent Cam Inman said Hayne also took courage from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and recommended that he forget about this drop and think about the next game.
Jarrd Hayne led Minnesoa Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This isn't what Hayne and his vast Australian fans imagined for their first game at the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing out of the field after he dropped the ball, and then the Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy told them that he couldn't think of a worse start for his NFL career on 2DayFM 104.1.
He said, "This is just one of those things, you get upset about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of his first game of the 2007 Origin with a back-up.
Still, this has been a great experience for a 27-year-old actress.
Hayne released the pose in Instagram, holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint in a gate in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, has been imprisoned, the oil company Yukos has been seized and his pro-democracy efforts have been cut short.
In Nepal, Police Protestors' Plastic Bullet Squeeze Results Four Dead
A senior official reported on Wednesday that four people have lost their lives, including a 4-year-old boy, after police opened fire on the new constitution offered in the country with plastic bullets.
The incident occurred Tuesday night in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathandu.
District chief official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said the protest from 1,000 was gathered outside a police station, and some of them dropped stone and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray to fire in the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 cops and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used because they were usually less deadly than they were killed in such a high mortal case.
The conflict has been the last of weeks of violent protests throughout the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new constitution will reduce their political impact.
The ethnic Tharus group, who wanted to build their own state, also performed protests in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have lost their lives in violent clashes since 10 August, 11 of them were police officers.
At this time, four major political parties agreed to divide the country into areas -- a new constitution in Nepal, which has been run by the central state for centuries, and unrest is also considered a crucial but creative step.
Studies on a new constitution have been going on since 2008, but law makers have accelerated this process after the devastating earthquake that took place in April and caused thousands of people to die.
Law makers worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathandu this week, and officials said the new text will be organised by Sunday.
The NHC says there's a 60 per cent hurricane south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Storm Centre said a large low pressure system about 350 miles south of Cape Verde Islands is 60 per cent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was seen between Cape Verde Islands and Little Antilles, and the Miami-based forecast center said there is a 60% chance of tropical hurricane forming within the next two days.
Google started a fund-raiser campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a donation-matching campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations who have escaped from their countries that have been damaged and poverty-stricken and helped thousands of refugees to Europe.
Google has announced a donation attempt on his blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of a manager making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who ran away from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"There were many dark buses and train trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear on our journey," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe has grown, many families like my family need help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations offering assistance to refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Children Rescue and UN Refugees High Commissioner.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation to the Google.com / refugeerelief address until it collected $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the main reason for it is the four-year Syrian civil war that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He's also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which has been damaged by many wars.

Minimal obese diabetes patients can help with weight loss surgery.
According to a new research, it could take at least five years to see the benefits of obesity surgery in type 2 diabetes-grade obese patients.
But it's too early to tell if diabetes patients, which are medically obese, are living longer than patients who haven't had surgery after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote an article on JAMA surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality to reveal itself."
Kilo-loss surgeries, otherwise known as bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach diameter.
They reduce hunger and reduce the body's food digestion ability.
Over the years, the barriatric surgeon has been proven to be effective in treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on advanced obese people with body mass index (VKI) 35 or above.
It is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9, measuring over the weight ratio.
25 or over BMI people are overweight, while 30 over the BMI are obese.
You can calculate from this link: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
In the new research, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from the experiment they've been testing two types of barriatric surgeons -- gastric bypass and tube stomach surgery -- which have been used since 2007 to treat types of 2 diabetes of middle-class obese patients.
From the end of the fifth year of the investigation, the average BMI 31 to 24.5 have been reduced.
The BMI of those who were treated for non-surgical diabetes remained stable around 29.
Diabetes are partially solved in 36% of those who have surgery, and 28% of them.
Diabetes have been partially resolved in only 1% and only 2% compared to this group being treated in medical ways.
Also, the writers stated that blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were usually better in the surgical group.
Researchers also have shown the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects blood sugar in patients over time.
According to researchers, it's best to keep the A1c hemoglobin under 7%.
After surgery, the A1c hemoglobin rose from average 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
The group that was treated with medical treatment remained stable around 8%.
However, with improved A1c hemoglobin levels, this better "glycemic control," according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates, who conducted the research, he has not dropped mortality in these five years.
The research team compared the findings to these two types of surgeries.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with the tube stomach surgery, the group has lost more weight (18.7 to 142 kg), in the BMI (7.4 to 5.1), and in the A1c hemoglobin (2.1% to 3.1%), higher falls have been seen and the probability of their diabetes to be completely reduced (46.9%).
Although research does not specify a clear benefit for post-op survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that according to a study conducted by more weight patients in Sweden, it has valid data that the surgery extended its life expectancy.
In this study, the chances of obese patients who had had had a roadatric surgery were 29% lower than any other group who had been treated more traditional in 15 years.
Although this new study has not shown the benefits of survival of surgical patients, according to Blackstone, it is reassuring for people involved and below BMI 35.
This is the most vital part of the article, because the BMI group says this surgery is safe, no increase in risk of death or renal disorders, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking seriously the issue of gaining weight with the patient falling under 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse it after collecting these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama said Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
At the beginning of a 10-day visit to England, Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Centre for Compassion in Oxford.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that humanity's interests should be put forward, rather than in the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, however admirable, he stressed that the response to the refugee crisis of countries in Western Europe is insufficient for this situation.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although he appreciates Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, Dalai Lama said they were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring permanent peace and permanent development to these Muslim countries through basic education," he stressed.
We need to figure out how to reduce the deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never been a solution to problems, "he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also mentioned what George Bush did after the 9 / 11 attacks and said that the US's violent answers started the chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I conveyed my condolences to President Bush and expressed that the way to resolve this problem was through non-violent methods.
I know your instincts are good, but he used power and caused unexpected consequences, "Dalai Lama said.
Four times higher in the last four years when children swallow hand antiseptic.
Poison control centres in the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 per cent in high-level drinking tissue swallowing in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand antiseptic swallowing in the 12-year-old children reported to the centre came from 3.266 cases in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
Lopez said to CNN, "The children have shown more to these products, and unfortunately, there are faces to be removed into the emergency room."
He said some kids drank their hand antiseptic, and some of them did it in a social media indictment to impress their friends.
Video on YouTube shows teenagers drinking antiseptic for cheap drunkenness.
Some teenagers have been reported to mix antiseptic mixture with alcohol-related mouth water to gain a stronger self.
Little kids can smell antiseptic appeal.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of the more attractive ones are the scented ones.
There are strawberry, grapes and orange-flavored hand antiseptic that are very attractive to children.
The hand antiseptic contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few shots of alcohol poisoning.
According to a statement by Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the Kansas University Center for poisoning, the Kansas City Fox 4 television, "highly concentrated alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses lying around, but people leave these hand antiseptic in the middle, and that's the easy way to get a lot of alcohol for the kids.
Recently, the six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four doses of strawberry-scented hand antiseptic at his school, was taken to the emergency room to get treatment.
His blood alcohol rate was 0.179, and according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency service doctor who took care of him outside of the Gwinnett Medical Center in Atlanta, it was twice the legal alcohol limit adopted in a grown man.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and walk when he came into his emergency room.
Rithey reported that the alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, so the doctors kept her under observation during the night at a separate children's hospital, despite any sign of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that it was "very scary."
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or short the theme of antiseptic tissues and move them to places where children can't reach.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some antiseptic were found to be associated with death cases.
In 2013, two women from Ontario were killed by swallowing a hand antiseptic containing an unexplained toxic substance.
Health officials stated that the substance may not be ethyl alcohol, but methyl alcohol with fatal impact, as indicated on the list of contents.
In January, three fourth-graders from the north of New York were conspiring to "plant anti-bacterial products around the class," according to police reports.
The teacher was highly allergic to the hand antiseptic, so he banned it from being used in class.
The police referred to this plan as "a wasted attempt" as a disciplinary punishment for the school administration.
Come to Samandura

Son of a bitch is innocent!
The killer's out there shaking his hand and grinning at our faces.
Some people are trying to divert attention.
While the killer is in front of us, instead of pointing at the killer, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
The killer's a cover-up.
He's hiding her.
And after he disappeared, he tells anyone that he didn't actually have a crime.
The fight we've had over the last 10 years has been very clear.
Someone wants to narrow down the circle of fire around us and burn us down.
And someone's trying to stop it, and more than that, they're trying to put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, rain it down.
Someone's after doing it, producing it.

Protopopov has been announced to have made a profit of $80,000 (243 000) in this method, which he has removed and sold some of the concrete that was placed on the highway using his position between 2010 and 2015.
7,750 euros in exchange for 15 million lire
The woman who lived in Venice in Italy, Viola Colombo, earned the right to turn 15 million lire into euros, which she found in an old crate from the Internet auction site e-Bay.
In 2014, Colombo, who bought several euros, was turned down by the Central Bank to change the old Italian currency lytes as euros.
Colombo, which the court finds right, will receive 7,750 euros (approximately 26,000 TL).
Request UNESCO for non-female island
Japan applied for the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage in 2017, where only men are allowed to set foot because of temples on it.

Saudi Arabia did not give up TUBITAK
Science, Industry and Technology Minister Fikri Yıldırım, Turkey's Scientific and Technical Research Agency (TÜBİTAK) said that the Ballistics Video Analysis and Identification System (BALİSTİKA) had a new agreement to sell a second party to Saudi Arabia, saying "The number of other parties will serve in Saudi Arabia, which includes the development and establishment of the eight systems will serve in Saudi Arabia."
The light has made statements about the BALISTICA, developed by the Institute for Space Technologies Research.
The system has provided a comparison to the data found in the central database of weapons, bullet core and casings seized in the incidents, the Light said, thus eliminating the problems that ballistics experts face as they examine the casings and bullet nuclei.
Light said that data and accompanying information from different geographical locations could be questioned by hiding together by BALISTICA.
He noted that one of the most important features of the BALISTICKA is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more detail and less mistakes, stressing that the decisions by ballistics expert can be taken fast and that success is greatly increased.
BALISTICA was exported as part of Project "SUBA-1."
Noting that the BALISTICKA met all the criteria for success and received a full note from the Police Directorate, Light said the system, founded in 10 separate areas, especially Ankara, covers Turkey.
Speaking of the success of the system, Light reminded me that the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia was exported and the establishment of the six regions was successfully completed in 2013.
The light said the BALISTICKA was made a new agreement to sell a second party to Saudi Arabia, signed the SUBA-2, which is the continuation of the SUBA-1, adding that the number of additional 8 systems will come from 6 to 14, which will serve in Saudi Arabia with an agreement that includes development and establishment of the additional 8 systems.
Crocodile fossils the size of the bus were found
The pre-historic sea crocodile has been reported to have found 10 meters long and 3 tons of weight.
Only the length of the crocodile's skull was measured to 1.6 meters.
Researchers called it "Machimosaurus rex," and published the findings in Cretaceous Research magazine.
Federico Fanti of Bologna University, the lead writer of the article, said the fossil, which appears to be 130 million years old, is "almost the size of a bus."
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the massive saltwater crocodile "was found at least at the top of a food chain in a specific area at the time."
Paleontologists have announced that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile in the sea, has been hunting in the sewers by setting up an ambush.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to be "Sarcosuchus imperator," who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago, reaching 12 meters and eight tons of weight.
They're all so confused!
The first book by author Ece Özgür in 1996, "All women's heads are confused," was adapted to the theatre under the same name by the Aysa Productions Theatre.
Deniz Çakırak, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turkic Source, Kadir Chermik and Şebnem Sönmez are running the game by Selen Küzer.
For the first time, the game of 'Poz' and 'Dry Gun' has been questioned by the confusion in women's heads, where Uzer has had the first experience of writing and directing.
The game met with the audience at Trump Show Center last week.
The game begins with radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that led us to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, trying to jump down.
It's obvious who he is and why he tried to commit suicide, because his neighbors next door intervened.
_
The "Ebru Civilized" portrayed by the Sea Coat is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There are things that have been piling up since you were a kid.
The inability to taste father love, the exclusion of student life, the lonely childhood, the misrelations, the incomprehensible, it brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mysterious woman who lives across the apartment with the next apartment's chatty and pure cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) keeps her talking.
They approach the situation as if it were a normal, normal process.
She gets more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three, the famous singer who cleaned his house, he joined Meltem Rock (Silk Source), and it became a mess.
"Meltem," which comes to it with its own dignity and sincerity, can't help but sing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt is gaining a different dimension from the fact that the realtor Murat (Kadir Chermik) broke into her house with a spare key.
The singer 'Meltem' lied to the press, it's driving things crazy.
The play also uses Nazan Aprel's "Street Girl."
_
For the first time, Küzer managed to maintain the pace and flow of the game.
Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Turks are pulling the comedy load of the game.
Caricature types played by the two are able to make the audience laugh with their mimicks, their lines.
Şebnem has been very good to the stage for years, while Deniz Çakıru has shown a convincing performance to reflect the depressive state of the 'Ebru Civilized' state.
The award-winning film of Tolga Steel, Kadir Chermik, who made his name speak of his performance in Sarmaşık, has successfully accompanied these four women.
The only perilous game described as a crisis comedy promises to laugh without confusion.
And what I remember most of the beautiful words that the Shebnem Summez played out of the mouth of Perran, is that they read the pen; they see the pen, they see it, they see it, they see it, they see it.
All the kids thought they'd die once to punish their parents, and for some reason they've always cried.
She's hanging in the air like an ununderstood joke.
She's always looking for a funny story she forgot her most important part of.
In fact, every story begins with some kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can't stand things without pockets.
You're surprised where to put your hands.
The more surprised we get, the more our hands grow.
People talk about what they don't understand and make it up.
A misunderstanding will come true.
All women are confused because they're confused.
Since you can't manage to die, you have a chance to live.
'Eat up and live a long life '

"The protein is more nutritious than yogurt, because protein covers basic minerals and vitamin B," he said, expressing that milk is one of the nutrients that can be consumed with more than milk, but more useful than milk can be consumed safely at any age.

One of the most natural ways to keep babies out of metabolic diseases is to be exact.
Friend of the intestines
This unique drink that doesn't end in counting benefits is the friend of the intestines.
We have 1.2 kilograms of bacteria and mushrooms in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are divided into two groups because they're useful and harmful.
The useful microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
Probiotic activity has as much impact as our liver, and when it's consumed enough, it prevents harmful microorganisms in the intestines from sticking to the intestine wall and spreading.
Corruption of healthy microorganisms in the intestine causes a lot of diseases.
The health of the digestive canal must be preserved in the right way.
And for that, we must certainly consume enough probiotic.
It eliminates these problems in the intestine.
The shroud is the most effective probiotic bacteria, and the useful bacteria in it have a huge impact on the strengthening of the intestinal system.
It allows good bacteria and mushrooms to grow healthy and be useful in the intestine.
In regular use of shrinks, intestines work, bowel disorders disappear, swelling decreases and a healthier digestion.
A healthy intestinal system means a healthy and uninfected body.
"The shroud, which is good for cases such as appetite, insomnia, respiratory infections and allergies, also helps to get vitamins and minerals more quality from the food of babies, so it also takes an important role in baby feeding," he said.

Letters from tiny students
The police and soldiers who conducted terrorist operations in the region, the central Sur district of Diyarbakır, have received letters from children in the West for moral purposes.
At first Aksaray 75.
Istanbul's Western Atatehir Nature Science High School and Eskişehir Ataval Middle School students, including the annual Republic Elementary School, started working as co-ordinates.
As a result of these studies, students at school pressed the choreography that they formed the moon shape for chocolates and then painted poetry and pictures close to 1,000 letters.
The children later sent their work to the Diyarbakır Police Department.
Diyarbakır Police Department has set up an exhibition table on the work done by children in the West as co-ordinates.
The exhibition set up at the new Security Directorate building included students' work.
The exhibition was first visited by police officers who served at the Police Department building and the citizens who were operating.
With the letter written by each other and poetry, it affected the people who read the pictures.
A student who wrote a letter about operations in central Sur district said in his letter, "Our beloved police are grateful for your sacrifice to protect innocent people in Diyarbakır."
The exhibition will continue until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who has been repeatedly criticised for his policies against refugees, has been named after another refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who escaped from the war in Syria to reach Duisburg, Germany, and his wife, Tema El Havar, 21, called their first child Angela Merkel.
Speaking to the German press, Tema El Havar said, "We are grateful to be here.
To show it, we named our daughter Angela Merkel. "
Father Memun El Hamza said, "Germany has become a mother to us."
This is the second time.
The baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27th.
According to the German media, little Angela Merkel, born three kilos of 300 grams and 55 centimeters, is in good health.
Last year, a Ganyan refugee named his daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees opened "Mother Merkel" cards to support Merkel.
Consumer trust in the United States is at the top of seven months
According to university data, UMICH increased 0.7 points in January compared to the end of December.
The market prospects for the index, which has recorded its highest level since June 2015, were determined to be 92.9.
"Consumer confidence has carried its rise to the fourth month by improving expectations for future economic growth," said Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan Consumer Studies.
"The expectations of individual financing have largely maintained its highest level from 2007 due to the weakness in inflation."
The statement also included the prediction that consumer optimism will now depend on the extraordinary decline of inflation.
The UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance since last year with average 92.9 to 2004, is determined by the results of a 50-question survey with at least 500 people each month.
Super Lottery Results
The Super Lotto results were revealed last night by the National Lottery Administration.

Putin licks what he spits
Russia is preparing to recognise the status "can do business with Russia" in case Turkey cannot meet its services any other way, while the Russian Tour operators Association has announced "Russian citizens do not give up Turkey."
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, calculating that the removal of current economic ties with Turkey will bring additional cost to Russia, has prepared and published a new "exceptional situation" bill for the Russian government.
According to a draft published in the Russian Federal Directorate seal, even if it enters the construction area, it is expected that Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to do business with Russia.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources outside Turkey or to benefit from the products and services of Turkish companies and companies in cases where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional cost.
Which Turkish property and services will be included in this category will determine a karma commission to co-operate with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
So it can be decided by bureaucrats which Turkish company can work with Russia.
According to the same document, private companies and state companies in Russia will have to prove to the commission that they are not immune to their work with Turkish partners.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government, the registration of privileged Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
The Union of Russian Tour operators said yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up Turkey.
"Despite the ban on the tour and the advice of the Russian Foreign Ministry to go to Turkey, our citizens began looking for the formula for organizing their holidays alone."
In the social networks on the Internet, the number of articles called "the most practical and cheapest way to take a vacation in Turkey" grows like an avalanche.
The most common suggestion is to make hotel reservations online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the price of oil that went below $30 as "dramatic" development for Russia.
"It was a terrible surprise for our government as no one thought oil would fall for $30.
At this rate, it seems that the budget will not be able to meet as it is now, "he said.
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announces that economic sanctions will get deeper after the crash of the plane crash.
In those days, our businessmen, our THY personnel, who tried to go to Russia in the usual order, are officially suffering at border crossings.
Turkish goods are crawling in customs, being subjected to unthinkable controls.
Not more than a month later, and yesterday, Nerdun Hacioğlu from Moscow reported it.
One way or another, sanctions are getting a little soft.
But why?
The reason is simple.
It's because in an era where the economy is so globalized, closing border doors with the methods of a century ago is no longer your effort to turn political conflicts into economic war.
Look, we're still writing to Iran about how the economic embargo has been breached for years.
Two neighbouring countries, such as Russia and Turkey, who seem to have a lot of friends, but are not particularly dependent on each other.
It's not technically possible for you to tear these two countries apart on a night like that, which is intertwined with its businessman, its tourist entrepreneur, its client.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country from the chimney.
It is best to make political debate at the table and settle it without creating new Reza Zarrabs.
Without ever infecting the economy...
Attacking the hotel at Burkina Faso: 20 dead

Netherlands: Assad must be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Beşsar Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICM) in The Hague.
At a conference he attended in The Hague, Koenders said he was responsible for the refugee flow.
As long as Assad is in power, Koenders noted that peace cannot be possible in Syria:
Assad must be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
A man with so much blood should answer in the face of judgment.
Assad is also the sole responsibility for the refugee current that we're dealing with right now.
However, I am aware that Assad will not leave his post any time soon.
This should be discussed first, and Russia needs your help in that scope.

Gossip Cauldron: There is no discrepancy in Celtic
When Leila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place and she can handle it, Griffith doesn't care about the words "incompatible" at Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the punishment that SFA gave Neilson and the January signatures of the team, with Warburton's inhibitions.
Leader Don's scored five points with Celtic.
ADAM Rooney's first half penalty gave Aberdeen a right win against Hamilton in Pittodrie, and gave the Don a chance to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the word incompatibility.
In Celtic, Griffith pushes rumors of incompatibility against his hand and says that he and his teammates have never been forced to meet the Dutch League leaders in any way under a heightened sense of observation.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The absence of Scotland's title race annoys Dutch de Boer
Rangers' former midfield player and former international player for Dutch football Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because they had no competition with Rangers.
A current Ajax envoy, De Boer, said, "In Holland, they no longer give the summary of the Celtic games, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They talk to each other when they talk about teams, they take care of it.
There was a lot of tension in the old team games, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch those games.
She swore I'd fix things, Leila.
RONNY acknowledged that the Deila Celtic fought, but the Norwegian boss said it would reverse the departure.
The defeat against Malmö followed the match against Aberdeen of 10, which now leads by five points on the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had a bad time in the past, and we will return again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very disappointing, and a lot of people are angry or upset about what happened.
We're in the same situation -- but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfers are inhibited
Despite his comments that he had identified some January transfer targets only a few weeks ago, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is afraid of signing, insisting Ibrox does not want to break the team.
The old Brentford teacher said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players who come in the summer, there's a pre-season period where you get used to them, and we've seen it in our own group this season.
The team's really good.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement
In the window of the Swansea Forvetes, Michu connected with Celtic and failed to predict that he could retire when his contract with the swans ended.
When he was 29, he suffered unbearable pain from a troubled ankle for two years and found no way to get out of Wales in the summer.
The hearts are ready to fight the SFA on Neilson's comments.
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the hearts were 2-1, and then they lost 3-2, then the defense player's red card turned everything upside down -- the third red card to cancel in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up on what he says, he insists: "I never questioned the union, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was scolded when he sang an offensive song about former heart player Rudi Skacel.
It occurred in March 2014 at a bar in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby game and the heat of that moment," he said. "I can tell you for sure that I will not go to Tynecastle, except to play with Celtic anymore.
The Tannadice board trusts the Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, the Dundee United board, still has confidence that the board of directors will fix things -- but they agree that the decline in the field must be over.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
"We'll get the kids ready to go again," Donnelly said.
Mclness is happy to win ugly against the Dutton.
Derek Mclness admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately hold on to Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's seventh win, which led them to the top five points in the league, thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty.
McInnes said, "There is no team winning without winning this game, whether it's trophies or leagues."

It's been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain a part of England.
In these 12 months, we've seen developments in the Scotland Business Force market with increased employment and decreasing unemployment.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, I'm going to watch a man get killed due to a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll sit at the death row in Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first held through his best friend in January, and as shocking as I was, I agreed.
The closer I got, the more scared I got.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It will provide a unique perspective.
Right, journalists are allowed to watch the executions in America, and since there are more applications than available, a terrible lottery appears while deciding who will be chosen.
Oklahoma dropped media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will follow without feeling it.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's best friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past few months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials said I couldn't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be given a pen and a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of unbiased over Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to him.
And he said, "You can say it better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip doesn't agree with me on some of the things I say and write.
He won't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could get me off the witness list whenever he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there and write them down.
He thinks that if he dies, public opinion will help with the anti-death penalty.
A reporter from Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, please listen to my podcast series.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I have no idea Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death is enough to make himself an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't believe there's enough evidence to legitimize a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch her die with this perspective.
I can't claim to be really objective.
You can look at the other reporters there for that.
The impression you're going to get from me is that you're going to get the impression from the person who watched a man die who was killed needlessly.
After a wet police chase, he was convinced of the Canning River.
Canning Vale was dry when the police officer convinced him to take him out of the Canning River.
The alleged escape from a police car behind a Perth man ended up in shallow and muddy water trying to convince a police officer to "gently convince him to come back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for trespassing in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he broke into the Canning River and tried to get away from the police.
But he couldn't get far.
"Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine, who stands in the water and says," I'm not going out, come get me. "
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "Good police negotiation."
Deputy Chief Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape."
The champion, Ben Cousins, provides a permanent example of the mind.
In 2006, a Cousins police left his car to avoid alcohol control and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts failed, but he inspired the local community to plan a prank Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claimed that the butler ratted himself out and threatened to let go of the race.
Peter Moody claimed the Racing Victoria butler tried to build a tailor in their stables last year and threatened to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the authorities and the union department and said they were conducting a personal campaign against her to exclude Lady Tatai at the final bait for the race Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the races, and that he found himself in difficult conditions that he couldn't explain when it came back positive for the cobalta.
He said he was biting his tongue for 18 months against the claims of the Spanish, and he didn't want to look "like a beauteous grape."
"I wasn't going to say that, and I closed it for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry and everything happens all of a sudden," Moody said.
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react, and you suffer the consequences of it, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to walk around with my head high and my bosses know that I'm trying to do my best for them.
When they start thinking I didn't do it, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'd think about what I'd do with my license if I did.
Moody once detonated a bomb that accused the Union Department of being in his own barn in a racing.com interview.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- I call it -- and they offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I did in the stables," Moody said in Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a crook.
If that's the case, they all have to return their brides because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
The former president of RVL, Robert Roulston, the new president of RVL, David Moodie and the current director of RVL, knew it at the time, and now they know it.
Is that supposed to make me think you're becoming personal?
RVL has a series of balls, and maybe he wants to make people besides the employees responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people outside think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But where I come from, I don't care about anything, and it makes me sad.
It really hurts me.
I will put pressure on them, and I will burden them with the responsibility of deciding.
I have my family's support and I walk away.
The disappointment of the employee's long-standing cobalt investigation and the next scratch to include Lalim has made him "throw my license across the table."
Moody, who became famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Hawayar, described the winning race day maintenance rule as "ridiculous," saying that it is against the rules to put mud or clay porridge on the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this. "
One of my men accidentally put the mud on his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have bought it yesterday, which he did.
Took him a race day.
Moody may face three months' suspension for using porridge during the race day as a result of an investigation by the executives.
It's a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who crashed and escaped in Cobram has been arrested.
The police arrested the guy who crashed into a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
Bike was removed to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway, due to serious injuries.
The police said the shooter escaped the scene without helping the wounded.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping, and other traffic crimes.
40-year-old Cobramian cyclist remains stable at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responded sharply to his opponents' allegations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described criticism targeting his own team as an effort to create a agenda for NRL's two favorite priorities.
Sydney Rooster coach Trent Robinson said they let the judges wrestle with their own team in the semifinals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett told Storm that following a semi-final match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he called it "a win" for the ragbi league, and that two Oueensland were not "too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team's struggle and said they were focused only on "contact."
Bellamy said it took power from criticism from two leading teachers because it meant they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
This is going on -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year, we've only made a real impact on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously he's been teaching a big team, and he's probably not used to losing it with a little shock for himself.
It's funny how this happened this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "exciting football," reminded Bennett of Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons winning by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He made a topic of comparing his own games on Saturday night to our Friday night game, and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember when St George was criticized for being a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give up his rat ass.
But now they have a team to play football that we can call exciting football and especially young halves with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these kind of players.
In 2010, he put this point, and now everyone wants to play football like this -- not every team has a half like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play like that.
It gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they're a little afraid to play.
Six weeks ago, when they went to the big games, they probably didn't think of us.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm and Roosters have a higher score than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, but I haven't seen it yet, but what was its score?
Our game is 20-18, and in our game, both sides have more scores, but this is exciting football?
Or is it exciting not to cut the attacks, but not to make scorching attacks?
That's my agenda.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here in a future phase.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks won their first final game Tuesday night at AAMI Park, so it's not this weekend.
Serbian man has been released on bail for $200,000 for drug crimes
The man who was admitted to Queensland was arrested on 40 kilograms of cocaine and faced a possible life sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five people who came from South America through Vanuatu and came from the Shalay yacht in Coomera in August, followed by the federal police who followed the drugs last month.
Maksimovic was seen at a meeting with his accomplices throughout the morning in the marina, and then met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of commercial cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to have all the drugs and that he could be in the cafe for an innocent cause.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of escape.
They have open connections to Serbia.
He travels often to Serbia, "he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in the public trial.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to bail him out.
"After reading both people's sworn statements, it is clear that the $200,000 bail price is a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But he warned me it wasn't enough alone to keep him from going on trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for both Australia and Serbia's passports and every day going to the police station and following the curfew between 6: 00 and 6: 00 in the evening.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send images.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child abuse visuals.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was asleep, opened a session in an online message service, providing her with a series of inappropriate children sent by another user.
She woke up later and realized she didn't have a phone and found her phone in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before he warned her mother.
The police took care of it and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers found at the address, and discovered "web searches" about it, using terms for finding inappropriate children.
Hogg later claimed that the reason he did this to the officers was to run the "pedophiles on the Internet" and "act like a cop and scare them."
"This is an addiction -- an addict that scares people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but he said he did it to scare the pedophiles into acting like a police officer.
He was asked about meetings with the unknown person who sent the pictures, who asked him to send more pictures than they did.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick ideas and wanted to watch rape and murder.
"When she found the messages on her phone, she called her mother screaming and shaking and crying.
Anne saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and came after the charges.
She was interviewed, and she said she was using computers and PlayStation to look younger than the defendant was.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lived in Ward Road, Dundee, was convicted of violating bail on 25 January this year and not attending the court on 24 March this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim said that Hogg should not be included in the category of sexual crimes because it may be discussed that there is no "obvious sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case to October, when the social background report was filed.
Hogg was released on bail on this case, but he was detained for other unusual cases.
There was a record of sexual crimes before the time of the sentence.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made the wrong speech in parliament.
The oldest leader in Africa, Mr. Mugabe, fell down the stairs earlier this year, landing from a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The parliament's opening was tarnished by opposition lawmakers' allegations that they received anonymous death threats if they booted him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his speech to the nation in parliament last month, they swallowed him and kept interrupting him -- he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Democratic Movement for Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received a message on their cell phones to avoid disturbing themselves during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message comes from an invisible number to the journalists, but the title is' Death '," he said.
He says that their immunity to members is valid within parliament and that when they leave parliament, immunity does not work.
The chief spokesman said he was "concerned" about threats against the politicians of the party run by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in order to restructure and reduce costs in institutional services.
The HP will leave two listed companies later this year; the computer and printer will separate their jobs from faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected layoffs will result in around 2.7 billion dollars at the beginning of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These reconstruction activities will provide more competitive and sustainable expense structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company," said Meg Whitman, head of the HP and executive office, who will head the post-separation unit.
"Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than the HP today, and we will have a large and deep portfolio that will help companies move to the new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we are much better off than before to meet the developing needs of our clients throughout the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Corporation's annual income will be over 50 billion dollars and will focus on providing "uncompetitive integrated technology solutions for companies."
His garage in Palo Alto is divided into two companies called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley" and founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to build electric equipment.
The HP is going through a major reorganization to deal with transforming from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The HP, one of the world's largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the final moves in the sector of faith, which firm-oriented companies do better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that Wilshere was injured before the Dinamo Zagreb game and his teammates were having problems.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury was in September and that his treatment was planned, and there was no reason why he shouldn't play during Christmas.
The best scenario already means that Wilshere is going to miss at least four games in England, and given his past history, it seems unclear whether he will join the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing thing about the last problem is that Wilshere had a strong finish of the last season after a separate ankle injury, and then he looked for the old sharpness of the season.
This kind of injury is not a threat to his career, Wenger said.
It's a bone that's not fully healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has no connection to her wrists or previous injuries.
According to a medical perspective, that may be true, but as Wenger will admit, there is a danger that a player who returns in the middle of the season will be injured further.
There's also an unsettling pattern.
According to the research conducted by the Premier Wounds Ltd, Wilshere had 23 different diseases recorded since the beginning of six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league game.
In the big picture, Arsenal has been one of the two First League teams who lost most of the time due to injury since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes that the record for injury last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes you have an open period of injury when you return from injury, a process you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope his body is stable, I trust that, and I believe he will do what he deserves.
He has the Tottenham Hotspur games that he will play in front of Arsenal, which will begin the fight against the Champions League on Wednesday night in front of Zagreb, and will play next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing the team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, which makes sense that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play.
Wenger can start with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott and Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give the players the breath they need," Wenger said.
The Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, although Arsenal is one of the most feared stadiums in Europe, is one of the open sideburns of the F Group.
Dinamo won't be defeated for 41 games after producing his own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree earthquake based on the Richter scale.
This is the 10th concussion in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal received a lesson last season from the defeat against Monaco in the Champions League, and continues to motivate the club with its remote goal to bring its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," says Wenger.
It's never been like this in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have enough experience to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not delusional.
Friendly Fest: The comedy program that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar portraits in programs is remarkable, especially at a time when men need more to open and suicide rates among young men are at the top of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of male deaths between 20 and 45 years old; and compared to women, it was three times more than men.
In order to draw attention to this problem, the Dismal Anti-Life Campaign (CALM) has declared 2015 a male year and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There is friendship at the center of the struggle to accomplish this difficult task.
An investigation between the high school student who showed over 2,000 depressed symptoms showed that if the person suffering from this distress had a high number of "healthy mode" friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
In the same way, a circle of mentally healthy friends for those who are not depressed downloads mental difficulties that can arise.
But of course, friendship has to be accessible first.
In this era of social media heavy communication, the focus of style rather than content makes it more priority to respond immediately instead of meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people, even though it's really all about isolation.
The concepts that artificial successful psychologists call external-driven values are under the sovereignty of money, image, social status; the internal values that have deeper impact on our mental health -- our internal longing for personal development and friendship -- are going to be wasted.
As a billionaire video player recently explained, money does not buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned this focal point upside down.
The characters were not defined by their work, but by their personalities, and they made that happen with their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler often hugged, watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross' contact with Rachel was all coming from the knowledge that even if they were in the background to fully explain their feelings, they could actually relate to them.
What a benevolent employee tells me is, "I've seen how the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference when listening to depressed and suicidal people."
Most men who contact us can't talk to their friends.
A feeling like "get along" is very powerful, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness. "
One of the programs I can think of when I'm offering long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He emphasized the small moments of his boyfriend.
In my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they're in trouble, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the scenes are redesigned to celebrate?
Or better yet, if you see anyone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You have no idea how much your friendship will make a difference.

Di Maria made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö with her goal
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal in Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the Swedish team to beat PSG's opponent with a goal to Malmö at the beginning of the Champions League on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
In the match with Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain began the fight against the Champions League on Tuesday with an extremely comfortable and clear victory against Malmö at Parc des Princesses.
Di Maria became the PSG player who led the French champion to the Champions League before it was four minutes ago, but they failed to assess the second goal that Cavani had thrown in the head in the 61st minute.
In Group A, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not just to get out of the elimination groups, but also to improve their quarter final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played when they scored was not the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahim spent a lot of positions around the penal field, and he was taken aside later against the team of his country where he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League, but it's not easy to win 2-0 for our competitors, and even though there are some things we need to improve during the season, it's a good start," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and win, even though I didn't give up a goal or two more.
After the injury, Ibrahim returned to Paris with one of the three players played with Bordeaux in the 1st League at the end of the week, but stayed in Di Maria's shadow at the fourth minute.
When the Argentinean wing player was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as an actor who would bring PSG up to a higher level in Europe, and when Marco Veratti ran behind the Malmö defense in his pass and sent Johan Witand into the remote corner, he showed that those who thought that was not wrong.
However, everyone was disappointed waiting for the PSG to win a great victory.
Malmö, who ruled out Celtic on the play off, had a five-man defense and two players deep in the middle field, a heavy opponent.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic launched very little attacks, except for the shot that tore off the pole of Kevin Trapp's protected mansion.
On the other hand, PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and unproductive hits, and in the first half, Ibrahim failed to make the final move in at least five attacks, and when the second half started, he failed to keep up with Cavani's game.
However, when he came to organize his colleagues, he showed that he was more adept, and in the 52nd minute, he was the one who gave him the pass of the falsolu hit Di Maria sent to Witand's castle.
After the second goal was full of an hour of Cavani, the Uruguayan player noted Maxwell's sixth goal in the season with the head of the left wing after Abraham's hand.
Malmö had run out of ideas to go back to the game, and after the unintended goal of Ezequiel Lavizzi, Wiland saved David Luiz's shot in an empty position, and did not allow the score to change.
Later, Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class superior to his team, Norwegian said: "Our final Champions Championship match was last year in December."
Since then, we played ball at the Swedish League, not only the same level as him.
The teams in the elimination aren't enough.
A hat goes off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore has acquired $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore received a coup on the falling price and made $2.5 billion in selling his shares on Wednesday in the plan to divide their debt.
Glencore, listed in London, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to pay his own debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of market value this year, was seriously affected by the prices of goods that fell due to China's economic slowdown on demand and causing confusion in markets.
The rights problem led to Glencore's stock prices rising early Wednesday morning at the London Stock Exchange.
The shares opened 0.69 per cent higher in the FTSE 100 index and increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock plan, which was part of the plan to reduce $30 billion in debt by a third.
The company sold its new shares for 125 cents per share, and that number was 2.4 per cent off Tuesday's closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares equivalent to 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth have roughly cut iron ore prices in half; coal, copper and other goods have fallen between 20% and 40%.
The White House has confirmed Xi Jinping's Washington visit
The White House confirmed Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement said that the first official visit to Washington by Xi would take place on September 25th, and that Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November, had a return visit.
After the bilateral talks of the two presidents, the President and First Lady Michelle Obama will have dinner with Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
It also stressed that "President Xi's visit would extend US-China co-operation on two countries' relations as well as regional and global issues, and allow President Obama and President Xi to take constructive care of the issues that are disputed."
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop by Seattle before Washington and meet with some US technology leaders, and then move to New York City to join the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to discuss Washington's concerns about allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities and some controversial issues involving China's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes the diversity in the film production seem insignificant.
Matt Damon opposed African-American film producer Effie Brown, saying it wasn't necessary to be behind the camera during a variety discussion.
On Sunday night at HBO, Project Greenlight emphasised that Brown needed alternative views on the black main character in the selected scenario.
Damon claims that when we talk about diversity, you do it not on the cast of the show, but in the cast of the film.
Shocking Brown reacted with comments from the Martian film actor, saying, "Oh, wow, okay."
To discuss the finalists of Damon and Brown, co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers were brought together.
Brown first said, "I wanted to make people think about how to treat the character of harmony, no matter who the director is."
The only black character is a whore shot by a white wire.
The publisher of the beloved White People insisted on managing the film, the finalists asked for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio. Damon said their assignment could end the way we didn't want them to. "
After the debate was published, there was a social media dissatisfaction against Damon's comments.
"Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain his diversity about this person as painful," Twitter user MrPooni said.
After Tweet was sent, he received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 pounds.
Damon's comments came when the right racial expression in the media was in the front row of social debates.
In 2014, after being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Life movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials to stop discriminating against colored people throughout the country.
In February, singer Prince spoke highly of the movement while promoting Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
He said the albums are still important.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the recent Black Life Movement have issued a statement in response to the question whether Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important person at Fox News, should be considered a group of hate groups.
The leaders said the Black Life is a group of love networks.
Damon was recently announced on the list of exhibitions artists, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's unclear whether he accepted the invitation or met with the Pope yet.
'American Ninja Warrior 'crowned its first champion
Professional rock climber and commie Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night and receive a $1 million reward.
This competition, which entered season 7, had never seen a contestant who could complete all the stages in the obstacle park.
At the season final, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay on their final tour.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first to complete this part in his time, and thus succeeded in becoming the first athlete to complete the hard fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won by finishing it three seconds before him.
After this difficult victory, Caldiero spoke to E News in shock of winning a million-dollar grand prize.
Isaac told E about a huge amount of money for his salary, and he said, "I think it's great to even think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or lived with it."
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine how... the future is unknown.
Produced by Kent Weed de The Hollywood Report, he met with the final, and even though Britten was the first contestant to finish the part, he explained why there would be no reward.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
"Anyone who finishes more than one wins the award that makes it the fastest," Weed said.
Even though money was a great reward and it changed lives, he won a big bonus.
I don't think he has a bad idea about that.
She's so happy to do what she did.
He got tons of compliments from his fans.
He's a great guy and a family man.
A hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If anyone's going to beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if his roles had changed.
The American Ninja Warrior has renewed the contract for the eighth season, and the shoot will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers just beat Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season didn't go very well for the Detroit Tigers.
Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now the last of the United States Central League.
The Tigers who reduced his game to corruption were able to beat Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field by making a perfect game on Tuesday.
The Twins have lost the chance to rise to the American Second League Wild-Card by crossing the half-point gap between Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even for one night, the situation was to return to a good game that wasn't seen for most of the second half of the season.
"Victory is all fun, no matter what," according to Tiger's manager, Brad Ausmus.
Tigers' artillery, Alfredo Simon, was able to score a number in the sixth and ninth rounds by showing early offensive support with Detroit scoring three times in the first two strikes.
Simon (13-9) scored six 3 / 1 hits, three of them running.
That was only the third quality start in the last nine tours.
"I just want to close the year strong," Simon said.
It's hard to waste every game for the backup, so I wanted to get deep in the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tiger's elected shooter, made three hits, and the two of them ran, which was the first RBl he won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night on this side of the four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He shook the bat tight," said Auschwitz.
He looked good (in the batting practice), which was clearly better at BP than he was in the game.
At the end of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance to get back in the game.
Midfield player Byron Buxton started the batting sequence by making a couple on the left-field line.
Right-field player Aaron Hicks only got a slow shot, and Simon caught Briandozier the second goalkeeper swinging for BlaineHardy.
Mauer, the only player who could resist the shooter, Drew VerHagen, the two-right-wing player in the run, has moved on with courage.
With a pair of runners in the second tie run, VerHagen managed to pull third baseman Trevor Plauffe into a double game.
Plouffe hit the DP for the 27th time this season.
Detroit went past Mauer RBI after trying to guarantee ninth place, and he made contact with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon by doing 5-4.
However, he was captured by Sano in three launches for the right fifty-five rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early exit of Phil Hughes who lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two strikes against experienced right-handed players who have been away from the field for more than a month because of the back burn.
"Frankly, that's not the game I wanted to play," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable on the sequel, and I managed to make some pretty good shots in the third round."
The first time he made a successful shot, Husches picked up second baseman Ian Kinsler.
He left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the game, with his right-hand field player J.D. Martinez out twice.
Victor Martinez competed with runners to pass the 0-21 tape in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos watched the right with one shot, won another run, but Victor Martinez got kicked out while Victor Martinez wanted to make the third, so the threats ended.
The Tigers added to the second, a couple from the catcher James McCann and two-thirds of the situation by winning a couple of outskirts from the middle-space player Anthony Goose.
The Twin manager, Paul Molitor, said, "That was a big hit."
He didn't hit it very well, but he threw it in the right place.
The shooter Hughes scored three shots that didn't score until he was replaced by the right-handed savior A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs and four inaccurate hits in six strikes.
The Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of the game due to the pain on his shoulder that he used to throw.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries since mid-August, has been scheduled to begin work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, LHP will begin against the Twin with Daniel Norris DL.

He hasn't played since August 20th due to the pain on the right.
The Tigers and the Twin will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will fight Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group responsible for managing reforms that the economy should be more open to speed up growth.
"China must develop policy of opening by specializing in foreign investment," the president said at the 16 Centre Forward Group meeting to strengthen General Reforms.
Xi said it would create a new area for economic growth by bringing new reforms to life and energy while encouraging the opening.
The leader group adopted a series of proposals such as the negative list that regulates market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the institutions (SOE) that the state owns to include private capital and review the recording system of the settlements.
According to the statement, a negative list will be made that defines the banned sector and business branches for investment.
The system will be tested and developed by testing programs.
This is an important move, because it will give the market a larger role in collecting resources and make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen their control over companies and allow companies to run their own business.
It also said that China will examine new anti-border economic co-operation models in border areas and new mechanisms will come in to encourage regional growth.
More areas will be opened to private investment to open sectors controlled by the state.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and will provide them with better services by protecting the interests of foreign funding companies," he said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to take permanent settlements or "green card" by optizing and putting application processes on a road.
It was also discussed in the meeting that the legal rights to practice were guaranteed and the development of professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
Miniature bag now very fashion-time newspaper Friday Eki
In the fashion world, roads turn around and come to the bags.
Recently, the current has been the miniaturized ones...
It's possible to say that small bags attached to the elders are also being noticed.
They say everything's small and beautiful.
I guess that's the point of view for the bags, too.
Almost when they couldn't get enough to move the streets with bags in their luggage, the wind started blowing in the opposite direction, and the bags inclined to shrink.
They already had small bags, but this time they came to us with the smaller arms bags.
These tiny bags can only fit your phone, credit card and key.
The current started with Céline and Hermès, it spread with Prada.
It also affected the new models, when the bag fascination became miniature curiosity.
Loewe presented his fun bags with two sizes this season.
Panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags are the most elephant-looking ones.
The mini-sizes of the large bags that luxury brands offer with phenomenon names seem to attract the most red carpet celebrities.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag, which Jane Birkin has been offered, is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to be mentioned in a bag with a press release, but that's how it's in the memory now.
Fashion weeks allowed the mini-bag flow to become mass.
And in the podium, the mini bags come forward.
You can't possibly put them on your arm because they're pretty tiny.
They can be used with long hangers, cross-referenced.
But in the podium, we saw those long hangers wrapped around the wrists of models.
The Fendi is one of those who move the mini-bag to a point.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in the mini bag, but can't give up on them.
Big bags, friendly mini bags.
How?
By turning the mini bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to the big ones.
This presentation in the podium has been rapidly compensated on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in the skin
Turkey will compete with world brands on my reputation.
This experience in production is now enriched by design.
Laft is one of them.
We see black models that used to be a couple of them now take their place on shelves every season.
During the season when black people went this high, the bodies found their best friend.
Skin fragments and leather detailed designs come forward as a rebel friend of the subjects.
In general, the zipped short models called "motorbike" are on the agenda.
As the strong air of the skin completes the black parts again, the chipped long blues, the sparkly sweats provide a sporty appearance.
I used to be a teenager and he wanted to get lost in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Now the young want to carry on a piece that gives you as much attention to elegance as it is comfortable.
In that way, it's possible to say that with the collections and complementary pieces of the Laft, you understand the target mass correctly.
Small for Banksy, big step for "global."
The world premiere of the collection of "The Art of Banksy," which brought together the works of mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which was the product of the artist's 15-year work and the first exhibition of 85 original artifacts, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy Building.
The first exhibition of mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened in Global Karaköy (Rihtum Street) the other day.
The world-famous artist who hid his identity and used the title, of course, was not at the opening.
And we don't know if he's in Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazaridas, the curator of the exhibition, Bansky doesn't even know about this exhibition.
There's no reason for him to be allowed.
Because Bansky and Lazaridas, an old friend, left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibitions were collected from the collectors, and some of Lazaridas.
But Bansky followers have issues to worry about.
What would Banksy think of the "The Art of Banksy" exhibition where 85 works were put together?
How would he afford to enter the exhibition with a ticket ($35)? What would he say if he saw the small store at the end of the 800-square-meter gallery field?
The Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, Rose Now, would it make a sound that her work, which makes attention to the world's injuries, was printed in rags, wallets, necklaces?
It's a disappointment to Banksy followers to make such a consumer product of an anarchist soul who hides his identity.
It's not Banksy's style.
But you guys still get the limited numbers before they run out of tickets!
For Banksy, the big exhibition for the small globalized world can be seen until the month of "The Art of Banksy."
They are despicable and unjust.
If you leave, they'll dig a ditch.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted to academics who signed the declaration.
"They are cruel, they are despicable."
Indeed, those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, "They committed the same crime because they were with those who were slain."
"In this act in Sultanahmet Square, which smells of history and civilization, I also shared our regrets with the German President and the German Chancellor for the deaths of 10 German friends in a region like this.
I would like to convey my condolences to all the German people from here to the families of those who died first. "
"Our struggle for terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
"I strongly condemn and condemn academics who stand up against all these acts of terror and publish a black declaration and sign under those massacres," Erdogan said.
The fact that our nation understands who is far more closely, the professor in front of you, the doctorate, doesn't make anyone feel better.
These are dark people.
These are the wrongdoers, and they are the lowest.
They committed the same crime because they were with the massacres.
Now, in the event of Çıar, where will those cubs put the 3-year-old Mülüde, who is a martyr with his father?
How do they fit into their conscience to be next to his killers?
I call on all judicial authorities, universities' Senate, due to these actions against our constitution and our laws.
Yesterday, I said the steps needed to be taken must be taken quickly.
And whatever they're going to do, they should go out there.
Let those who want to make politics do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, let them dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm being so clear and clear.

Celine Dion lost her wife
René Angélil, wife of Canadian singer Celine Dion, has lost her life.
Angélil discovered Dion's talent when he was 12 and married in Montreal in 1994.
After being diagnosed with cancer in 1999 with Angélil, Celine Dion took a break from her career.
'I found 26 people looking for two wrestlers. '
Mete Customs's second documentary is "Young Pehlivan," 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February) became the first Turkish documentary selected for "Generation Lplus."
Customs, originally from Edirneli, but a production company in Holland, told me why and how he took the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans" will compete in the "Generation Kplus" of the Berlin Film Festival, telling the story of six boarding students who are aiming to be world champion in wrestling.
The first Turkish documentary selected for this episode is Young Pehlivans, one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear Award.
Born and raised Dutch, but originally a Edelnelian director, Mete Customs.
In Turkey, where he came on summer holidays as a kid, he listened to his grandfather's fat wrestling stories and watched the competition.
"There are only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our horse sports is unfortunately unknown." He wants to meet with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project remains inconclusive, but one day the magazine news he reads on the plane opens the door to another project to Customs.
'We stayed at the sugar factory. '
The 10-11-year-old wrestler, Mete Customs, who tracks the summer that mentions two little brothers, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The father of the children won't let the documentary be filmed.
"I've been thinking about what I can do all day.
Because support from the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn. "
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasia where the kids were going to meet.
I thought about going there.
When I was looking for two kids, I ran into 26 kids who were into wrestling at school.
We started shooting in a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory dorm."
The biggest challenge the documentary in three weeks to the director was language.
"I didn't know what to face when I was shooting."
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
Young Pehlivans focus on the story of six of 26 child wrestlers.
Haran, who was raised by his grandfather and suffered weight problems, couldn't attend training because he broke his arm, ambitious but health problems, Betullah, the lovely child of the school, Umit, the youngest champion, Ahmet and the band...
"I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot in practice for the first week and a half.
What I wanted was for the kids to pretend they didn't have a camera.
"Fortunately, they got used to it quickly."
It was a surprise to be elected to Berlin.
"We had our preparations, but it was a surprise that we were chosen to Berlin," Mete Customs said, saying he did not expect the young Pehlivan to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival.
The young Pehlivan are not a sports documentary, but a production that tells the children their struggles and transmits them from their lives.
"I wanted to bring up stories about children with family problems who could deal with their identity efforts and problems," he said.
Support for academics from the art world
Following the declaration of "Academics for Peace Initiative," the storm was launched yesterday to investigate the academics and to take them into custody, while there are also reports of immediate support.
The first support came from literature, including many famous names.
The other day, filmmakers announced their support yesterday.
"We stand next to this honorable meeting of academics who call for peace as artists working in theatre and stage-show arts, and we declare that we are on the side of freedom of expression, equality, right of life and unconditional peace."
"With our conscience and with all our hearts, we give our voice to the call for negotiation and peace of academics."
Among them are more than 400 filmmakers, including Deniz Türkali, Attila Özdekoğlu, Nadir Sarığbek, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Honu, Jade Masioğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karatel, "We are with free thought and art.
But if there is no ', but without', 'we shall not be partners in this crime!'
"We are with the Initiative of Academics for Peace," he supported the academics.
"We are with academics who have become the target of the lync campaign," the Film Writers Association (SIYAD) said.
The Initiative for Academics for Peace issued a statement titled "We are not partners in this crime," calling for peace and negotiations with the government in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January.
Metne also signed up for 1128 academics in 89 universities, including their theories and books, including noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar.
President Erdogan and Prime Minister Davutoglu strongly criticised the academics' statement as "support for terrorism," calling for "institutions" to do the need for Erdogan. "
Following this call, some universities launched a formal investigation while putting an end to the academics' work.
Yesterday many academics were taken into custody.
I'm a fan, please help me!
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren nose, Justin's hair...
Trying to look like celebrities is considered normal until one point, but at the point when it starts to completely affect life, it's seen as psychological disorder.
'Celebrity business syndrome ', aka' worship of fame 'is a new topic that has already become an academic topic in the world, and we have a new conversation.
Running to the salon with the ladies' famous photos could be normal until somewhere.
But don't forget about the 'Hürrem Sultan' year where all the teenagers wander around with Irish red hair.
It's already been reported that the Beren nose was the head of the plastic operations that we left behind in 2015.
Gentlemen, it's not that different on the front.
Dressing like a Polat Alemdar for a period was an acidic.
And now, on the contrary, a wind blows away.
Justin Bieber's copy is full of young men.
So much information that we've been quoted with has been read on the Internet a thousand times: "When you first go to the barber, cut the sides of your hair on the side of your ear and around your head."
Only the ones will be short.
After the cutting process is over, you must shape your hair with light water.
When the modeling process is over, stabilize your hair with spray help.
"To get the hair, Justin has to shape it while it's damp."
All of this has already become an academic issue in the world, and we think about the newly-spoken 'Celebrity business syndrome', aka 'worship of fame' syndrome.
Celebrity fans look like a ball of love to us.
Artists brag about the number of fans, how much it affects them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simple.
Especially when teenagers decide what to eat, what to drink, what to listen to, what to wear, according to celebrities.
Excessive commitment to names presented as unreachable, role models described as mental disorder.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Iron acknowledges that Turkey is behind in its work in this area.
But he doesn't miss that families are slowly conscious: "One of the main issues of psychology is that man is reconciled with himself, that he finds peace within his own identity."
At first, it wasn't too serious for children to fill their rooms with posters, to dress up as one.
This is changing now.
The parent feels the need to interfere with the situation.
"Passion to someone is a sign that something has gone wrong in the young man's life."
The fans who ride the emotional speed train
The attention to celebrities is safe unless it's too extreme.
He offers attention to symptoms such as not wanting to marry, being jealous of his wife, choosing his clothing belt, Iron.
We're talking about famous people named after him.
It's normal to wonder about them, to be involved in their lives, to a place like this.
But when the expert psychologist says, "When there are no names in the family or around to represent the child at the point of good behavior, the gap is definitely filling."
There are no good examples all the time.
"And he's copying the negatives, too, kid."
When we consult them on how to approach the Sumerian Iron begins by reminding them that fame is more adolescent.
Given the fact that teenagers may be insecure, the problem is getting more comfortable.
On the other hand, when we complain about the limitations of their families, we're dealing with young people waiting for support and compassion: "We have to consider their emotional landing exits."
New research suggests that they are having difficulty with the changes in their brains.
"A young man who rides an emotional speed train should also be treated with passion, soft approach."
It's possible to change behavior.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Iron reminds me of parental duties to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Know her emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you get involved.
Never let it suppress your feelings.
Tell him you respect his admiration to encourage independence.
Instead of cutting it down, show him a good example, argue with him on names that will be role models.
Try to figure out where celebrities are in our everyday lives together.
It will work to read books that tell the true world of celebrities together.
Make sure you turn your communication into an adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same ways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity to change, accept them as they are.
Make sure you get expert support on the fantasy.
And he who is angry and envious admires
The basis of fame worship syndrome requires someone else to hope and get help.
Unavoidable love, actually, is a cry for help.
But unfortunately, that's not how it's perceived.
Besides, it's so common that there's no way to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu noted that there are certain names in every country that occupy television.
The syndrome is more of a connection to these celebrities: "They are extraordinary."
The general majority does not have their means.
Those who have it don't live by pretending to be them.
Either they don't embrace it or they don't dare.
"But he continues to watch with anger that can't live like them, even if it's not necessary."
There's no difference to the people who tickle or get angry.
They both have a deep fascination.
They make no trouble making money, they're on the agenda of the magazine.
Knowing that is enough to increase the mortality.
Another advice by expert psychologist Sümeyya Iron is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
The subject of artificial life should not be missed.
This is where the support of the environment comes in for the person who's passionate about fame.
However, the person insists on admitting that he is a fan and that he has problems like his own.

Must I have gallbladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Özbek answers questions in the corner of the Square Gazette.
There's rock in my gallbladder, and every morning, I wake up, and after the food, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with a stomach ache.
Could that be keeping me from losing weight?
I'm starting to use your alkaline right now, but I don't want to eat any less, I don't get any weight.
Ever since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
CEVAP: The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
And these abdominal pain complaints that are growing right after dinner are a sign that when you eat, the gallbladder is cramped and the inflammatory bile is poured into the intestines.
The intestines that are disturbed by the inflammatory bile are rapidly trying to throw out this phase.
That's why you often go to the bathroom.
And because you go to the bathroom often, what you eat gets thrown out without digesting, and it's slow to lose weight.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a gastro enterologist and the situation I'm telling you is detected, you can use antibiotics to get rid of it.
But eventually, you might have to have gallbladder surgery.
The alkaline probiotic may reduce your complaints a little bit, but it's impenetrable.
Whatever happens, I suggest you keep using the alkaline probiotic.
Because the biggest helper for you to weaken is this probiotic dust.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Teacher, when I'm stressed and angry, I feed myself and lose weight.
How can I handle this?
CEVAP: Overeating means that energy needs can't be fully met.
It could be because you ate less or because you skipped lunch in the morning.
And another reason why you can't digest the food you eat.
For that, your digestive system has to work well.
If you don't have an ulcer, a reflux, or something like that, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic drug.
You'll see a lot of help.
I can't get any weight, the doctors don't know why.
You have information on your corner that usually means to weaken.
It all makes sense to me, too, but my situation is a little different.
I can't get any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
Doctors say nothing.
CEVAP: Our techniques are not only to weaken but to restore the physiological work of the body to ideal measurements.
Fat and weak are the same kind of discomfort.
Being able to lose weight in fat and not gain weight in weakness is treated with the same technique.
And you're even weaker when you eat sweet and dumplings.
I guess you've figured that out by now.
It's possible for you to be warned by carbofism and gain weight with healthy nutrition.
So you've been weakened from your ideal body.
And our other patients got fat away from their ideal bodies.
You will gain weight and reach your ideal body, and they will gain weight.
If the system goes away, you lose weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

The boy who feels worthless is stuck in hate.
There are certain feelings in the human sense world that are born.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, anxiety...
But feelings like hatred, hatred, revenge, children are born with time and some misbehavior.
Every person needs to be an individual, including childhood.
So the parent or the social community would like to respect their decisions, to be asked about his own interests, and to feel worthy.
These are the basis for a healthy personality.
For example, the behavior of making decisions about the child's interests (what to wear, what to wear), the fact that the child doesn't care what he wants to do, and the fact that the child's rights are directed instead (the child who wants to go to football class) means not to respect the child's personality.
The defense mechanism reveals anger and hatred to protect him because the child who is not respected for his being and his being has lost his freedom of being himself.
"Because anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance," said the psychologist Hilal Arslan, who said, saying that he hated what was done to him, that he was trying to tell him that he was valuable to himself and to his environment.
"Hate here means' I'm in ',' which serves the purpose of protecting the child's respect for itself," said the expert psychologist, who said that it was a positive improvement in his personality development.
"If the child is allowed to be an individual, hate will disappear," he says.
The child tries to protect his own self by defying from anger and hatred
At the age of young, both body and soul, the parents of children in the most vulnerable times, said that the abuse of verbal and emotional violence by their environment could lead to negative feelings in the child, Arslan said, adding that his presence in neglect and child would make him feel invisible and invisible.
"It may be that sometimes it may be that their needs are not met in an emotional sense (not to rub your hair, kiss your hair, kiss your school or other needs), and sometimes their physical needs (eating, drinking, housing, school needs, etc.) are not met," Arslan said.
Such is the means of raising a door for anger.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are acts of humiliation, insult, contempt, scolding, unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling worthless, screaming.
These behaviors touch deep because they're about the boy's personality.
"The boy either loses his self-esteem by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is unworthy of being loved and inadequate, or he tries to protect himself from anger and hatred."
His teacher gave Boyko to Beşiktaş!
Dnipro, who Besiktaş wants to buy two football players, is preparing for the second half at Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevych spoke to the publisher agency on the 27-year-old Denys Boyko, on the list of black-whites.
"If the two clubs agree, Boyko will go to Besiktaş and make him champion," Markevych praised the national file guard.
President Fikret said Stuttgart of Bundesliga was also interested in his 64-year-old trainer, who was also involved in the situation of the 1990-year-old Brazilian Stoper Douglas Silva Bacler, whose institutions planned to transfer it.
Meanwhile, details of the official offer from River Plates came to the Argentinean player Jose Sosa.
