28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think there was anyone who might want to hurt him, and he said, "Finally, things were going well for him."
The San Francisco Forensic Institute announced that the body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning belonged to 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department reported that the cause of death was determined to be a murder and that research continued.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the ABC station in San Francisco KGO that Frank, who had previously worked as a kitchen chief in Boston, had been working as the head of the kitchen section of San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters official said that this death "shocked them and that they were deeply sorry."
"We are a small team working here like a tight family, and he will be very missed," the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, we would like to inform Frank's family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was initially staying at the hostel and said, "Things were finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said to KGO, "He hired an apartment and went out with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think there was anyone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was to make us a plate for all the time, to cook for us, "Louis Galicia said.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother used to adapt to everything.
He said, "When everything else in the world went wrong, it was this unprocessed diamond that shines brightly every day."
The people with information have been asked to call the SFPD Ihbar Line from phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: new job slows
Representatives of the assistant doctors have asked their unions to allow them to slow down business in connection with the dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) called on the general council (JDC) to support more business slowdown action from the beginning of September.
The ministers failed to satisfy concerns about the contract, JDC said.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a Twitter article Thursday night, JDC head Ellen McCourt said the government remains "insistent" about the problems that led to the rejection of the contract.
"In light of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for a re-launch of formal negotiations on concerns," he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has made an official request for the BMA board to allow a programme to boost the slow-down from the start of September.
The conflict led to six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the assistant doctor at BMA, resigned following the vote to reject the terms proposed by BMA.
During meetings before 54,000 residents and medical students voted, BMA told members it was a good deal to accept.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a valid way for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of incompatible people?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce that the eight-month war with words and economic sanctions has been officially terminated.
However, while Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart at St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara was the one who wanted this compromise the most.
Shake hands, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was very weak, and his limited standards could not be said to spread any heat against him.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned "good friend" Mr. Putin; five times according to a report.
I'm surprised at the number.
He also pledged that relations with Russia will not only return to pre-crisis levels, but will reach much higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, it was said that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
However, the cold impression of Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the Russian war plane on the Syrian border.
Then Russia's reaction was filled with rage.
Mr. Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back with a hard exit.
The resentment was much bigger, and the other side was thought to be friends.
Trust is going to be really hard to rebuild, maybe impossible.
Since November, the Russian people have also changed their minds.
The media under state control has targeted Ankara for months, staggering and aggressively.
Suddenly, the Turks blamed everything.
The most serious of them were accusations that Mr. Erdogan's family has gained profit from illegal oil trade in areas under which the so-called Islamic State is under control in Syria.
He totally rejected it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia can see it as some kind of victory.
The benefits of the call for a truce for Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and almost caused him to fall.
The Greek terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him quite well.
Also, economic reasons are effective.
Russia's sanctions hit hard, especially with a ban on special flights carrying a few million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal areas every year.
This number is down by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies are certainly relieved that the flights will continue.
They depend on the end of the season density in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted that Turkish agricultural products imports will be allowed to regenerate and decrease in fruit and vegetables.
To quote a newspaper in Vedemosti, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
However, the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it does not find the response to the coup attempt adequate.
As long as he has been angered by the progress of negotiations on joining the United States, Mr. Putin is involved in Turkey's lack of ties with the West and the cold between them.
The Russian leader appears to have received sympathy from Ankara due to a call to support elected officials following the coup attempt.
To remember, it was an inevitable stance for Moscow, who had a radical fear of changing the regime.
This summit, held at this dashing palace on the side of the sea, represents a "uniquely impaired alliance" by Russia and Turkey, explained to me by an analyst: the two countries that the West rejected and behaved badly combine forces.
However, despite this display of reconciliation, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important things about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, even though Moscow considers it a mediator.
After nearly three hours of first talks, it also supports the two presidents saying that it has not been discussed at the press conference.
The President of Turkey has clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, while Mr. Putin has chosen to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in Syria.
However, it is certainly a good development, when the two leaders at least start talking, given the potential for absolute disaster, which has been caused by Turkey's shooting and dropping of the Russian fighter for months.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the head of the bank board, the RBS brand will be placed in the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is related to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, it was almost sinking, so you had to back off and give up.
During that time, brand strategy experts used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This has been supported by millions of pounds for sponsorship from the Six Nations ragbi to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now it has been decided that it would be right for more national brands to step forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but there will be no new beginnings.
All references to the RBS will be changed to NatWest, except for the central and stock exchange in England and Wales.
For clients in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are smaller brands for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Militia Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
"Since we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be the brand where our employees are employed," the BBC told Scotland.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we have local targets, not global anymore.
Each one of these brands will come forward in a slightly different way in its community, and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands.
RBS announced that he would not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championships and that he was promoting different brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to get a sense of brands' bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?" he said.
Three years ago, if we had stated that we would be a great bank for our clients and present these brands, I would have found that offensive.
But I think you'll see a lot of changes in our work and focusing on the needs of customers, not ourselves.
We can re-activate these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dittori won the 3000th victory with Prediction in Newmarket.
With his double success in Newmarket, he exploded champagne after his 3000th victory.
Jokey Frankie Dittori won his 3000th victory in England in Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, John Gosden trained Predilation to win the second victory of the night, reaching this milestone.
Forty-five-year-old Italian, sixth jockey to this milestone in an obstacle run.
He follows the tracks of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special situation."
I'm so touched that my parents are here.
I'm really glad this is in Newmarket where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot -- it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel lighter and relaxed.
Bettori accepted the cheers by bringing Predilation after victory
In the obstacle run, two jocks reached this milestone: champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20 times champion and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4300 victories in his career full of records.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby race nine times, has 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it's not surprising that only a few people get to a milestone before him.
He's a man of style and strength, but he has a tactical mentality that allows him to outweigh others in the scale.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way, and with his excitement and charisma, he's been drawing people into this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if it wasn't just a jockey competing on weekends and big races, he might have won his 6000th victory.
To be serious, Frankie spent most of his 30 years in the United Kingdom competing with victories, which is great to see.
He's a very exciting character, and that's a very good feature for British races, but beyond that, he's an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dittori celebrated this milestone by jumping off a horse with a symbol.
From the races he ended up jumping off the horse to the landing, Frankie Dittori has been a symbol of British impenetrable runs for 20 years.
It was a road full of ups and downs.
In 1996, he won many great races, including his famous' Great Seven 'victory in Ascot, but survived a plane crash and was banned from obeying the drug ban.
Three years ago, during the return of this six-month suspension process, however difficult, he showed that he had a strong character to justify and return to the best of his suspects.
And it can continue for a while; he said he wanted to keep racing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin has relieved his personal pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his personal pen, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov was part of the close circle that Mr. Putin trusted.
63-year-old has now been appointed special representative for environmental and transportation problems.
A statement from Kremlin said that Mr. Putin "decided to put an end to Ivanov's Russian administration mission," but no reason was given.
This position has been assigned to Mr. Ivanov, Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is an old diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 1972, graduated from the International Relations of the renowned Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo embassy.
Later he was interested in presidential protocol and government personnel; that's how the statements on the Kremlin website are (Russian).
And he said to Mr. Putin after his duty: "Thank you for trusting me."
I believe the administration's most important mission is to support your activities as head of the state in order to oversee law enforcement and implementation of instructions.
Mr. Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that he asked Mr. Ivanov to resign and recommended Mr. Vaino to replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that amazes Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies for a long time, and Soviet security forces such as himself served the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as a special pen.
At a meeting with President Putin and published on state television, they both said the special pen was dismissed on their own will.
However, despite the smiling images given to the cameras, few people here are convinced of it, especially at this time when parliamentary elections are approaching.
So is this some kind of conflict of power?
No one knows that yet.
However, the official statement that a person who could become president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy has been met with grave doubts.
According to the quote on the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov made promises to Mr. Putin: "It is true that in the early 2012, I want you to trust me for four years for this difficult - or even problematic mission that you might call a problem.
Well, it looks like I served as a presidential special for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took this position in December 2011.
Previously on Vice Prime Minister and Defense Ministry duties.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin became the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), replacing the KGB, while Mr. Ivanov gave him custody.
When Mr. Putin went into power, he made Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
Since Mr. Putin's third term as president was against the constitution, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this mission has been transferred to Putin's next-of-kin Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became prime minister three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.

Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who were the producer of the show, announced that he was fired in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday before the declaration of termination.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues on the set.
In a statement, he said, "I'm sorry that such a thing has happened."
In addition to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, Gibson's character will be released from a programme following a group of FBI agents and will soon be given detailed information on a date.
Previously on Dharma & Greg, the 54-year-old actor has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement published on Friday, "I love Criminal Minds, and for the past 12 years, I worked with him to give him my heart and soul."
I'd like to stay to the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and most importantly the best supporters a program can have.
The programme is expected to return to the screens on September 28th for the 12th season.
The mystery of fish in the Banff garden
A man who lived in the Banff area applied for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish might be sandfish carried by a sea hose.
Bain, who lived 500 metres from the sea, released the footage in Periscope, hoping that someone would shed light on the emergence of two inches long fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The 1.35 billion-pound project must be completed by May 2017
The engineers combined the north and the viodic of the Queensferry Gate, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four shutdown between the "tablet fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge's cut from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The 1.35 billion-pound project must be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown was one of the first people to visit the facilities today and walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Pass.
We are all witnessing epic engineering with this project that uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build only this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that covers the gap between the Viyaduk and the bridge battalion, this is a delicate study that requires extremely sensitive tolerance for harmony.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge repair is located, which means that the concrete release of the first section of the tablet will be held today in Rosyth, which means that all of the tablet will be ready to be lifted over the bridge.
"In all bridge projects, the first shutdown is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents pioneering construction engineering.
After the final highway repair was placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north side or the black side.
It was carried out by your northern transmission being pulled up about 700 millimeters south.
It was a very big but very delicate procedure.
The reason it was big was because it was 222 meters long, almost 6,000 tons of weight, and it had to be pulled at about 3%.
The reason he was sensitive was because the team had very low tolerance values to match, only a few millimeters on both sides.
Luckily, everything went well.
Moelfrre Bay rescue team: Three men are lucky to be alive.
Three men are lucky to survive after falling off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfrre RNLI lifeboat station alerted the British summer clock at 13: 20 p.m. on Friday after the terrorist saw the case in Moelfrre Bay.
Three men were trying to swim to a safe area while their boats were on their way.
"We saw the boat circling them, and we were worried."
"Fortunately, until we were on their way to them, he went away with strong winds."
While two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man of 60 was found holding on to a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken to the lifeboat on their way to shore and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and never been hurt.
There was an emergency stop cable on the boat engine, but it must have been severed somehow from the person who used the boat when the boat was a lab.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A valuable kind of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's amazing how the world has changed.
The fact that young and children don't go out to play anymore, that they prefer to spend their free time staring at the screens, is that most people have been upset over the past ten years.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move off the couch.
The time spent looking at the screens was limited to television, and over time it spread to video games and finally to smart phones.
So it's really great to see that moving in technology and open air isn't the elements that exclude each other.
Of course, in the '90s, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, who was originally created for video games (later turned into cartoons, game cards and other side products), based on characters.
Like many elements of popular culture, this new game was a huge mess when it was presented in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, due to intense interest in overloading servers, the presentation was postponed in other countries.
Over the days, he reached more users than Pokémon Go Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players take their smartphones and go looking for Pokémon, followed by GPS, and take pictures of what they find '(taking screen images on the phone)' or 'catch them'.
He joined this madness by leaving the couch for a generation of young people to play the game.
In the United States, "average" has made a significant increase in the number of steps a person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, said that the ratio of the person who followed the Washington Post within two days after its presentation was increased from 45 per day to 53 per cent per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go; it only sees raw data at the level of exercise.
Most public health campaigns, which encourage people to "take 30 minutes off the couch" and "every day active," have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and they appear to be miserable.
But still, no matter how much the importance of exercise is emphasized.
The possibility of cancer or depression decreases by people who exercise regularly.
It helps with exercises, weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and has a list of long advantages that can't be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
So three basic elements of health are met: action, fresh air and entertainment with sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are some faceless gamblers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone could hit the door as they walk.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation has been presented.
Even though smart phone applications like Fitbit followed our move, he didn't give us any reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of innovation will pass, and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, many games will be produced that help people who go hunting through applications and virtual reality through interactions in the real world to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Boles received the gold medal in her gymnastics review.
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Boles is immune to all this.
It's dynamic in jumping.
It's comfortable with the balance device.
Surprising with the floor.
At first, it's pure perfection.
And now he's an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast completed the overall assessment on Thursday, showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
He was over 62,198 points, silver medals, and his friend, Aly Raisman, and the Russian bronze medal holder Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Boles of the United States performed on Thursday at the women's artistic gymnastics review final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles became the fourth and generally fifth American woman to receive the general assessment award, and announced his name as the best of all time and perhaps the best of all generations.
When the last total was released, he was overwhelmed with tears, and his long journey to get to this moment was over.
This success led to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who could be seen once in every generation that led to new levels:
Biles spent the last three years as one of the most successful in this sport with 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, and one of the most dramatic routines that led him to call himself "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test in Brazil was waiting for him; this competition was more between himself and the burden of great expectations than between Boles and other people in the field.
He would have been disappointed to return to the family house in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, who received gold and silver medals in a general review of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, Thursday, Aği.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a exclamation mark at her farewell party.
Boles insists that he never looked forward to this long run towards the summit, but that's not entirely true.
The part of the ground exercise also includes the symbolic transition of the routine with Latin music that will fit the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandmother and grandfather when she was a child and was discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman was coaching.
He hasn't lost any of the general evaluations since the summer of 2013; this is a winning series that should continue as long as Boles wants.
Even though Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, it was temporary.
The balance tools and ground exercises that Boles took on the world championship have not been done yet.
He went forward with 15,433 points in the balance device and he crowned it with 15,933 points in the ground exercise.
Raisman held her gently while waiting for the final score, and as Biles once wrote in a scrapbook, tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch of four years before he lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans called "nine."
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after a return that seemed suspicious.
For 19-year-old Boles, the multi-shared tweet he made earlier this week is now a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the serial killer case were shot listening to music in the car.
In Phoenix's first serial killer case for ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the car talking and listening to music, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway on June 12th.
The report says that the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car, shooting eight rounds with a pistol and driving away with another vehicle.
Police say these three murders didn't appear to be a robbery because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that the armed attack led researchers to investigate whether it was related to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, seven people died and two people were injured in nine attacks in the neighborhoods where the Spanish origin lived.
At the beginning of this month, Howard explained to CBS businessman KPHO, "This happened in the residential area in front of a house."
The suspect used a brown Nissan, a black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln in a model in the late 1990s.
The researchers refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that they were committed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was admitted to the hospital due to injuries, and then he died.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told the police it wasn't unusual for these people to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
Investigators found bullet casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat and detected bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microscopic patient: "She's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike their peers, Edmund has a microscopic disorder; this is a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
That's not what I wanted.
Of course it's not true, of course you want it. "
He and his wife Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or even survive.
Some doctors went too far to ask him to be admitted to a nursing home.
Picciuto said, "My first reaction was to tell you that I don't think people do it anymore."
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still can't talk.
However, he slowly reaches certain turning points.
He can walk with help and ride a bike.
Besides, he likes to play games and sing with two brothers.
Elizabeth shows Edmund's sign language to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But as we know, it's not sign language, it says Edmund made up his own signs.
The microsepsia can come out due to a series of different circumstances; there may be a genetic condition like Edmund, and during pregnancy, it can be caused by infections caused by measles and viruses such as Zika.
The symptoms and the pattern of the disease can be very different.
It's too early to tell how the lives of the people with the Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's it gonna be?
And he still doesn't know that.
In fact, I haven't asked you a question about the nature of the disease in a long time since I didn't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto is able to offer promising advice for the mothers of babies who have a natural apology due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and water raids in Louisiana, Mississippi have mobilized rescue teams
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday with more rain expected by Saturday.
National Weather Services said there was a surge in countless rivers in the northeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi, causing widespread flooding after heavy rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and that support for the affected neighborhoods is on the way.
Deputy spokesman Mike Steele, the governor's Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Prep, said there were demands for high water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele stated that only for Tangipaha neighborhood, there were tons of trenches.
By Saturday, most of southern Louisiana will have a water raid.
Weather services said it could fall from three to five inches to one place.
In southern Alabama, since it continued to rain in the Mobile region, there was a water raid on Saturday.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the week in the Comite River and the Amite River near the Baton Rouge in Louisiana, near Denham Springs.
Estimated Alek Krautmann said both rivers could leave many houses underwater in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the water raid in Ascension Neighborhood is a threat to the flow of rivers full to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached the level at 9: 00 a.m.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from the flooding of Amite and Wilkinson accidents in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were among the rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from the Beaver Creek, which is normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly through the night.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
He was coming all the way to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this is the highest level he's seen in the creek for 48 years.
Hansford said he and his family members were disabled and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he saved all three of the emergency workers with a large military truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
As the heavy rains continued, Krautmann said the flooding was "spreading rapidly" and authorities were thinking of issuing an eviction order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported that it rained 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the floor has been highly saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said that the streets under heavy rain and flood have the need to save the residents of Tangipaha neighborhood and vacate schools in five schools.
CBS business WWL said a woman in Tangipaha said that the city council member was under 200 houses' flooding.
The residents have been evacuated to two churches, but these are now under attack.
Neighborhood Manager Robby Miller said authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising water.
The shelters have been opened for the people who were evacuated in Amite and Hammond.
He said, "When the water starts to retreat, they will be allowed home."
Nearly two dozen streets have been closed in Hammond, Tangipaha neighborhood, due to rising water, and the trenches have been offered to be taken by residents trying to keep water from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum, city administrator.
Looks like it's going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison accident emergency manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continued stable on the Gulf Coast.
On Tuesday, a number of houses were reported flooding, but he said there was no report for Friday in that direction.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in this area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water in places I've never seen before," and added, and there's still rain. "
"Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, whose body was riddled with bullets, survived the Philadelphia attack.
Police have announced that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is the second time a 6-year-old boy was shot in the city this week.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown for Philadelphia by her grandmother and grandfather.
Her grandmother and grandfather Brown said there were multiple gunshot wounds in the body, including the pubic region, legs, arms and abdomen, but she was conscious when she was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Melendez explained to the station, "She suffered too much, her tiny torso was pierced with bullets."
I can't believe it.
The boy was listed as a critical patient at the hospital and passed through some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was going to start first class at local elementary school.
Brown was among the four who were shot in the Germantown area.
Two of them were 29, one of them was shot at by two 32-year-old men.
CBS Philadelphia expressed that one of the 29-year-old men is critical, and the other two victims are stable.
The station reported that the child was found in the front seat of a car with one of the 29-year-old men whose condition was critical.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether or not one of the wounded was aggressive.
Detectives said more than one armed assailant may have shot each other in CBS Philadelphia.
The crime scene was full of shell casings of different assault weapons.
Looks like there's definitely been a long-term conflict.
There were casings on both sides of the street and the sidewalk.
This shows that there are more than one armed assailant and they are both active, "Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
More than one house and vehicles have been damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police have been reported to have reviewed the security cameras.
Another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm with an accident bullet playing outside her house in West Oak district on Tuesday.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
The reason we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
That's what I call the Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team this year, and it has more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been more dominant.
Second: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Boles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspire many different ethnic girls.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing a similar view of America.
It also amplifies the presence of black and Latino women at the top of this sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
That's strong.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America supported her.
Now the whole world will be able to witness the extraordinary performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are now three World Championships, and their unexpected but ingenious gymnastics routine.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win a gold medal in women's general assessment.
And his teammate, Aly Raisman, won a silver medal.
We're witnessing the best times of this sport, but that's not what it looks like in sports courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to be part of the Olympic teams.
The reason they're the last five is because only four gymnasts will be on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and it's the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in fact, gymnastics is a very expensive sport and gymnasts who work in private gymnastics clubs, which are primarily paid by parents, education, travel, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families), and supported by many other costs.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support these businesses.
These clubs require a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts and gymnasts.
Maggie Haney, coach of Simone Boles' trainer Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez, has been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not allow communities to be more affordable and accessible gymnastics education.
I built my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my institutions, over 15,000 youth (first black and Hispanic) in Harlem, we offered free and low cost gymnastics training and coach both national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to provide quality gymnastics training for young people who deserve to learn this wonderful Olympic sport and take advantage of it.
gymnastics develops the body's strength, flexibility and coordination and provides mental hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination provides long-term advantages for health, school and success.
It will be inspired by this team that will lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
It's very important to girls to participate in sports activities.
We're going through some really exciting times.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, as an Olympic team, for showing up the "Girls' Force" and motivating a lot of young girls with different background to become healthy, strong, successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strike.
The ministers were hoping that the dispute would be over after the agreement was reached with the British Medical Association officials, but the 37,000 residents who attended the vote voted to reject 58 per cent.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced NHS's plan to implement a contract-related sanctions, expressing that "no one has property" and that further delays would harm personnel and patients.
The first assistant doctor group has been transferred to a new contract with changes in working practices at night and weekends to improve maintenance except for normal hours.
"The assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially because they think it will trigger the current workforce crisis and an equal attitude for all doctors is not accepted," said Dr. Ellen McCourt, head of the BMA's assistant doctors committee last night.
The first group of doctors has to make progress in the eight weeks remaining process, and time is almost over.
BMA's efforts to resolve the conflict by talking to each other were met with the government's reluctance to interact and in some cases deafening silence.
This is an improvement, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that his door would always be open last month.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act quickly, remove the sanctions and listen to assistant doctors' concerns."
Assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to increase business slowdown actions if he does not do so.
At the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, nurses and advisors had to replace the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the conflict would end after the agreement was reached with the British Medical Union officials.
BMA wants to improve the weekend fees for the 54,000 residents on the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director of the NHS Employees, urged assistant doctors not to perform any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said, "The strike does not solve anything, but by creating pressure on the currently busy team and services, it causes concern, discomfort and distress for patients, caretakers and families."
For the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Asians' Committee, and along with the Ministry of Health and other officials, we are positively close to their concerns about the Observatory Mission and the Position of the Report.
The continued positive communication, such as distribution, education flexibility, education costs, education costs, education costs for those who break their careers -- such as a mutual understanding of curriculum, educational consent and intergender wage difference in medicine -- was a sign of how serious it was to be carried out by the British Ministry of Medicine and the Ministry of Health -- in accordance with the agreements reached by November, February and May.
The drug that can eliminate the risk of a heart attack at £2 a day.
Thousands of heart attack patients will be able to take advantage of two pounds a day after authorities suggest that they be given more people for a long time.
The ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, decreases the risk of recurring crisis for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following the heart attack, reducing the risk of paralysis or any other crisis.
The NHS observer, NICE, suggested that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people in England have a heart attack every year, and one fourth of them has another crisis or stroke.
Heart attacks and paralysis are because fat materials accumulate and create records on the arterial walls.
If your record is shattered, it could cause a heart attack by blocking blood from the blood clot and going to the heart.
And if the clot goes out of place, it's paralyzed if it moves through the blood flow and prevents the blood flow to the brain.
Anyone who's had a crisis before is at a higher risk of having another crisis.
The Ticagrelor, created by the United Kingdom company AstraZeneca by Brilique, decreases the risk by reducing the probability of clotting.
Today's NICE manual draft suggests that people should be given 90 milligrams of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 milligrams per day with aspirin for three years.
"Although effective secondary prevention treatments exist, a quarter of those who have heart attack or stroke are often devastating," Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology assessment centre, said.
Fear of repetition can have a rather negative effect on the quality of one's life.
The evidence shows that the use of the ticagrelore with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of heart attack and paralysis in people who have had a heart attack before.
With the provisional proposal of Ticagrelore, we are pleased to increase the treatment options presented to thousands of people waiting to take advantage of it.
More than three years of information about the influence and security of Ticagrelore -- since it is limited to the risk of bleeding -- the manual draft does not offer treatment after this period.
PC culture has increased voting corruption in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlet mayor Luttur Rahman was relieved last year for corruption following the government report.
As the devastating government report presented today, political integrity culture has caused widespread voting corruption in Muslim communities to be ignored.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles scolded police, election observers and municipal court for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "extreme sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
The former community secretary and today's anti-corruption Czar said that voters should be digested for religious reasons so bad that police should be allowed to draw lanes outside the voting cabins to protect the frightened voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they voted.
In the current situation, the voter's name and address is enough.
The report suggests permanent ink to the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said the informants need to be protected in a better way.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and the decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to provide protection against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from corruption and financial fraud culture, which is holding hands with it," he said.
The report was prepared by Downing Street following Tower Hamlet's vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that following recent corruption and illegal practices, Mayor Lutfur Rahman would be relieved of his duty.
The court has determined that the Rahman has abused the religious feelings of the Muslim community "shameless," and has silenced the critics for racism and Islamophobia.
The Rahman "carried out his campaign based on the basis that the faithful Muslims voted for him was a religious duty."
By 300, the game was suspicious, or the use of fake identity, which was the result of voting like someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He warned specifically about corruption in using mail -- where the Muslim community allegedly imposed pressure on the old individuals to vote on their own island.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions to organise the voting system, including the fact that they have an identity with them to prove who they are.
"Some ethnic minority communities have been given pressure to vote in particular for the will of the elderly in Pakistan and Bangladesh, especially women and young people.
"There were concerns that state institutions ignored this kind of behavior due to extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion due to political integrity."
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals to regulate the system, including preventing political activists from processing the mail and voting papers for "gathering votes."
The report, examined by Theresa May, also calls for tightening record controls to prevent the election log from being used for immigration and social aid corruption.
Given the option for voters to show identity before voting.
After voting to prevent any person from voting twice, permanent ink to the fingers.
The systematic control of the subject's nationality to determine the right to vote.
Three-year restrictions on requests for automatic mail vote use.
The ban for political campaign officials and activists to process the envelopes of votes sent by completed mail and sent by mail.
Police are authorized to draw lanes around voting cabins.
The amendment of the law to facilitate the charge of scaring people under the 1983 People's Representative Act.
It's illegal to take pictures in voting cabins.
In voting cabins (other than Wales), it is only a requirement to speak English.
The strengthening of the training of personnel for the sanctions of the rules that allow voters to enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric brutally criticised the Police Department, saying that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlet case were "interesting."
"The election court has decided that there is no place for the Lutfur Rahman and his representative to blame for the recent corruption and illegal activities," he said.
With a number of reasons, he was found guilty of criminal evidence -- beyond reasonable doubt.
He also criticised the "box-pointing controls" that are not effective in the municipal court's election registries.
"Tower Hamlet's court order last year was a warning alarm.
Although our nation has the pride of creating the mother of parliament, the spread of anxiety and secret election corruption and rejection by some institutions could cause this good reputation to be damaged.
To be crazy for Kate's bike type and other famous characters of the Rio Olympic Players.
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went crazy for the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressive to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete who has noticed the resemblance to celebrities this summer while fighting for the gold medal; at least that's what social media thinks.
So, in honor of all the famous faces we've seen on the Rio Games and on our screens, FEMALL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than they do.
Hunter and Wolf: US Archer Team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Kate's similar bike track, a lot of people online showed that an archer could be as similar to Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the United States Men's Archers Team, shook Twitter after his pictures of the movie Money Hunter's Star appeared to be similar to his star.
And the archer admitted that he had been told that he looked like Leo since he was a child, realizing this madness in social media.
Brady told the Huffington Post: 'I don't think there's much resemblance except for hair and beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I guess that's a compliment. '
There is another resemblance to one of the most popular comparisons in London 2012, which will undoubtedly attract more attention this year: the incredible resemblance of British long-jump athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, meaningful eyes, was described as one and only like the American artist of Cuba, Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been described as the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user says that Nathan's Startup is an athletic version of the star.
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared to each other for a long time because of their thick eyebrows and lips.
The Russian team's silver-medal swimmer, the actress Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze skin and blonde hair as Nathan Adrian of the United States team, says he resembles the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.
Tough women: football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes.
Not alone: a Twitter user is very pleased that other people will notice that resemblance.
A theory that remains in the air: this user thinks that the fact that this couple looks similar could be a reason.
A Twitter user moved his happiness to this site about "the rest of the Internet thinking Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are twins."
In fact, the American football star and actress playing at Dexter have similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost the same smile as another gold medal gymnast, Gabby Douglas and Gabrielle Union, the star of the Youth Fire film.
CBC Olympic announcer apologized for the comment that the Chinese swimmer died like a pig.
The analysis of Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in the 4x200 m free race has enraged the people watching CBC's live Olympic broadcast Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize for the comments of one of his sponsors, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, who has been wiped out like a bad smell, and died like a pig in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought the mic was closed when women started explaining their own ideas at the 4x200 m free flag final.
It was heard that MacDonald, including CBC to add color to the spicer team, has made these words: 'The little 14-year-old Chinese have screwed up hard, baby.'
He was too excited, he went like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the flag race for 1: 57.79, allowing Canadian Taylor Rack to close the difference between China and China by 1.61 seconds behind.
Canadian viewers quickly moved after being shocked by the use of tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane just tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer say that the 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?"
Idiot didn't realize you were still on the air. '
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as the 4x 200 m Free Flag Race: '14-year-old Chinese heavily screwed up, baby.'
On Twitter, criticism of Byron MacDonald was published pretty hard and fast, and many of them reported him.
When Twitter users heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was, they couldn't help themselves.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow # ByrMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all look racist.
Shortly after, Scott Russel, who continued the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment: 'We apologize for the comment on the swim race.'
These were really unfortunate words, and we're sorry that something like this happened. '
CBC had to apologize at least 90 times more than anyone who tweeted in response to comment.
Another reporter, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued this apology to over 90 Twitter users, who reported complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network has issued a statement with a quick apology.
We'd like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been released.
Last night, on the air, we apologized quickly to our viewers, our social media followers.
We'd like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were highly inappropriate and unfortunate words, and Byron is very upset by what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and attempted to defend these words by saying he didn't want to commit a personal attack.
He said on CBC's Olympic broadcast, "I'd like to apologize for a comment I made last night following the women's flag race."
'I wasn't referring to the swimmer's personality, but his performance. '
'I don't need to say much, I didn't mean any disrespect, and I'm so sorry. '
Primark client barfed anger at the woman who desperately tried underwear in the middle of the store.
Clients didn't know what a woman would do when she took off her clothes to try panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she looked at what it looked like to herself, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
He kept looking, and then he tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried panties before she put them back on the shelf was the Primark store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
At the time, two children in the store's mother Jenny Davidson said that after she tried the mystery woman's underwear, she was "redressed and left the store without taking anything."
He said, "People couldn't believe his eyes."
He stood in the middle of the store and took a pair of panties out of the window, put them on by taking off his pantyhose and pants.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, he was standing in the middle with all his disrespect. '
'Everyone was looking at her when she took off the panties and it turns out she didn't like the panties because she put them back on the shelf. '
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he redressed and left the store.
'Those who followed him didn't seem to care, and he didn't think of the person who would buy the panties he tried on. '
Mrs. Davidson (33), who lives in the town of Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone else is going to take an uncleaned pantyhose and go home."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think that after she left, the staff picked up the clothes and took them off the market, which is a good situation.'
'When I went home with a new pair of panties, it would be really bad to think that someone else was wearing them and coming to me without washing them. '
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).'
The relevant product has been removed from the sale.
How can you protect yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga?
The outside world is extremely dangerous, but this video that Dailymail.com presented could help you be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, the chief master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation to learn how to deal with armed robbers nearby.
This video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber, whether it's coming from the front or behind.
Mizrachi says when you're approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around and see the attacker and empty the line of fire.
Then you hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder, and you punch it in the face with your empty elbow.
And then when you put your knees on their groin, the pain of the attacker will double and at this stage you will take the gun away from him, and the gun will turn towards him, and you will hit him in the face with the barrel of the gun that will stay above him.
And when the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is applied; you pull your body out of the line of fire and grab the gun and turn it into a way that the assailant can't shoot.
At the same time, you put your weight on the gun, punch the attacker through the chest area, turn the gun away from him and point the gun at him.
Does that sound tricky?
Take a look at the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright put his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
The British traveler took a serious test of immune system and gag reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting parts.
The server and travel writer Ian Wright (51) of Suffolk (51) put his tongue on a Euro bill to prove the power of the immune system, a Piccadily Circus banister, the siphon button of a train toilet and a pay phone in Russia.
Before licking each object, he used a liminometer to show himself and us what kind of business he was involved in.
However, the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which will be transformed into a film, gave some surprising results.
Although the idea of licking a siphon button on a train that was used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical experts regarding increased stomach bacteria and health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked made an impression except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to travel the world and eat strange and wonderful things and test his stomach's stamina.
From the general shabbins at train stations to toilet siphon buttons, this mission in a wide range has certainly tested the immune system.
"I haven't been very careful about my health since I was a child, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth from dust to worm and mud water."
And during the film, he proved the cause of that reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The reptile sample showed a luminometer count over 4,000 units.
To compare, this number has to be below 60 in newly washed hands.
However, in the newly washed hands, there was a Russian public bathroom, which he refused to lick when the luminometer count was over 4,000 units.
Mr. Wright and Fin dairy manufacturer Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.
He said in the film, "This is close to being one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I can't lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with valio gefilius, including lactic acid bacteria, as well as the C and D vitamins that helped strengthen the stomach bacteria and immune system.
"We really wanted to present something new to consumers.
Something that's impressive to watch and also explain the benefits of the probiotic.
We finally had a lot of crazy brainstorms where the idea of "Come on, let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon.
We just wanted to put the products in a much larger context instead of talking about products; daily good and bad bacteria around us, the importance of stomach health and the connection to the immune system.
The interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to give consumers more interesting information about this situation.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
"Let me tell you, if Ian had licked some of the things I wanted him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Naturally, it was easy for Ian to lick things, but some of them were pretty hard.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty licking acts. '
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health and 58 per cent said they were using products with lactic acid bacteria at least intermittent.
The Maganda family destroyed the Cornwall social residence prior to evacuation
A family of Maganda left 50,000 pounds of damage in the social housing where they were evacuated for scaring their neighbors.
After a number of complaints against Tanya Skeldon and her wife Shaun Trebilcock, Saltash was expelled from the residence in Cornwall.
When they were forced out of the property, the housing community officials were shocked to see that the property was irreparable.
There were big holes in the walls, floorboards torn out, garbage scattered on the floor and graffiti on the walls.
The family has now been removed from the residence and is believed to have benefited from special accommodation options.
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy said she was afraid the situation would be unavoidable.
He said, "This is really a nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
He has a lot to attend to, because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and they have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived in intermittent property, and according to the police, the family adopted a lot of scary behavior including fighting on the street with a baseball bat, scaring the residents, drug use, drug sales and excessive yelling, arguing and blasphemy.
In June, an anti-social behavior decision was made for Skeldon (47), whose name was Skeldon (47) in the Kira contract.
In many rooms of the house that was supposed to be destroyed, old garbage was found.
The floorboards of the property that was sold in the past were removed.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and that the police were often searched.
Cornwall Housing forced him and his wife off the property this week after giving them 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The evacuation was welcomed by the relaxed neighbors who said their lives had turned into nightmares.
One person said, "No one cared."
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep. '
We woke up because it was so quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and it's gonna be great now.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighbor of Cornwall Housing, said the family did not co-operate with the local administration.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called to the police.
There was trash and old toys on the side of the social housing covered with plants.
He added: 'It's really embarrassing that the tenant didn't take any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing applied to.
It was a very difficult case because behavior was extreme and their actions were scary enough for neighbors not to testify.
I admire the efforts of my team, Devon and Cornwall police forces, and members of the community, who have bravely come forward to inform us.
I hope this development will be understood as a message that the neighbors will be relieved and that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation.
The housing staff will have to clean up the garbage piles surrounding the house.
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis, fields, private items and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after admitting guilty of possession of Class B drugs on intent to sell.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her wife are now in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the house had graffiti on its walls.
Police say they will work to evacuate tenants who violated rent rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police Force said the evacuation is also a warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
He said, "This is a message for those who think that they can act as they please, and that their conduct will be annulled."
Devon and Cornwall Police Force, who will continue to work with their partners to protect the community, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified by a low-flying military plane crossing the beach.
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal, suffered the shock of their lives.
Portugal's Air Force P-3C Orion has flown extremely low
The Air Force expressed that it was a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when tourists start to panic when they walk over a beach full of jet-flying jets.
Dramatic images show military aircraft approaching almost at the level of contact to those sunbathing on sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Passioners stood up because they were clearly concerned about the noise caused by jet engines before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationists who shared the dramatic close-up video in social media, said, "He really went down two times and seemed to be about to crash at some point."
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
In Aveiro, tourists on the beach were horrified when the plane out of the darkness began to fly at a very low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the beach and that it was the only way to control them, so he had to go that low.
Due to the smoke coming from the nearby power fire, the jet flew lower than usual, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, the hard fires that were to be extinguished destroyed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air forces said today that the pilot should fly low due to conditions that make it difficult for him to see (intense fog and smoke caused by fire that can't be extinguished).
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
The London girl student, who joined ISIS, was killed in Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British girls who left London last year to join ISIS, has been reported dead in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said his family received information a few weeks ago about his death in Rakka, Syria.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he died in a Russian air strike in the Rakka region where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died planning to flee the country that was damaged by war and return to Britain.
"We hope that this will emphasize that it is really risky to go to war zones as a tombstone and a will for others, and that people will discourage to make that choice."
In February 2015, two female students from Sultana and East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told to marry an ISIS warrior in Syria and become a widow within months.
Reid said if Clinton is elected, he will not give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid said he believed that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if elected president.
The Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Most of the Senate leader Mitch McConnell said the new president would choose the replacement of former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and "they have reason to do so."
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he did not speak directly to Clinton and speculated whether he would nominate Garland.
He praised Garland and expressed that Clinton's team did not want to "ruin the situation" by making a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were the "minions" and "supporters" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for duty.
Treats said he was on the side of a naked calendar for women as well as for men.
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish an inspired calendar from Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of famous and naked people, they're working to find new generation of models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairies calendar.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, expressed earlier this year that this magazine was different from the old Playboys, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes the calendar is like this.
"We have to go back to exhibiting classic nudity, which is unfashionable, so that women like men can look at these images as a source of inspiration to women's bodies," Shaw said in a press release on the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or participate in open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: Who really buys records?
Middle-aged lonely men love vinyl.
Let us tell you that this is based on real data before we go to the commentary department to make great insults under our will.
According to Yougov, the return of records, which are very mentioned, is a result of middle age nostalgia, not the generation of Y that is after the innovation created by a physical object.
Those who recently bought vinyl albums are mostly between the age of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18 to 24 is the lowest possibility.
This is also not only caused by the accumulation of curiosity; it's an emotional importance; older vinyl buyers are often attracted to keeping their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
And the results of Yougov are correct?
If this blog had been broadcast on TV, the camera would have watched on a crowded street in Soho, walking in a modest gray suit, performing many jests before stopping and opening my hands and saying, "Then let's take a look."
Well, let's take a look.
While the centre of Soho is slowly losing its magic and unusual air, there are still several specialised record stores filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases.
I'd probably want him to stop by the camera for the next part; I'd be standing close to some of these stores, trying to get some information about their age and emotional status through observation.
Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, possibly a woman in her 20s), spends the afternoon in London to fill up a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I guess I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records (e-mail me the picture above, not following him home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is partly the result of expendable income; he can now buy records that he can't afford, and buy back what he sold in his young, broke time.
"Most of the stuff I bought in the late '60s were early' 70s, and I was only 11 or 12 years old, and I was too young to buy it," he said.
"I don't smoke, I don't drink much alcohol.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25), who works at Sister Ray, thinks most of the clients he meets fit the Yougov profile.
But he also realized that there was a new wave that was affected by the media's exaggerated ads, and that the people who heard this model coming back needed to buy back old records.
In my interviews, I realized that in 1998 or 1999, people were disbanding their collections.
The clients who sold their vinyl to buy CDs at first are now selling their CDs to get the records back, "he said.
This could explain the rise of individuals at a certain age that reanimate the vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, record stores offer a relaxing community of similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older clients were particularly offended by the uncontacted payment system.
Some vinyl attackers may want to seek refuge in the stability of the familiar record covers, which have been overwhelmed by digital worlds and rereminded of the memories of calm youth.
Wez says, "Sometimes it's because you fill a void or see material objects as some kind of comfort."
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think most people have it.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
A colleague who jumps out of a pile of records says, "We're like social workers."
A poll in April revealed that 50% of the vinyl albums received last month did not listen to the album yet.
The survey also found that 41% of them had a record player that they never used, and 7% of them bought vinyl even though they didn't have records.
At this point in the news, I would probably have shown a very concerned appearance while I was studying a series of bossa nova foods.
The "reward" aspect of this comeback is also noticed by Jonny (42) who works at the Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came to me recently and said," I don't have any records, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf. "
Although it does not represent a large percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have records."
These are not old people, young men, who are at the end of their decade, who are new to it.
Now, when I get to Fopp, which has reserved almost a whole floor for the vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is a little less religious than the stores mentioned above (the last part of Wild Beast) and rather than the soothing jazz, it's good to see the diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to solve psychological trauma that bothers them by standing next to one for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes and looking at the records on the sale.
Instead of spending it, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't get much, so he doesn't have a choice to collect records.
Very expensive.
It's easier to listen to music from the computer or other ways, but the beauty of the vinyl moves away like a loving person.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really nothing like that.
My last stop is a store where they say it inspires the new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outitters.
I'm watching a bunch of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter argue about buying a Crosley record.
On the left, there's a stairwell full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac, which is a mixture of modern and classic records for an average collection.
No one's looking; maybe it's just decoration, and some of them are too high to touch.
It's a completely artistic vinyl.
But curiosity about these items could mean that the industry will make more money and send less customers into the depths of Soho; there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time than most would spend more money on luxury items like vinyl.
However, my findings show that the results of the Yougov are at least true in the Soho record stores; they do not account for the female collectors and vinyl attitudes found in multiple records, record stores, or online forums.
These people are probably working pretty hard at school or offices.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday nights in a record store on Berwick Street, studying records and avoiding the looks of a 30-year-old television server looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don't know anything.
Greenland shark, the longest-lived animal in the world - video news
Scientists have announced that Greenland shark is one of the longest vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who works on sharks, said the record belonged to a five-metre-long female, who was thought to be between 272 and 512 years old.
The French court rejected an offer to destroy stores at Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to destroy dozens of compiled shops and restaurants at the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At this week's trial, Calais officials argued that the state should destroy a total of 72-degree tents, which the people in the camp sold from cigarette to energy drinks, or sold from tea (40p) for 50 cents or a few euros for basic food.
Calais Governorship argued that these places should be demolished because they created an unpaid parallel economy and risk fire and hygiene.
The benevolent groups, the court said that shops and restaurants are vital, that free food offered by state-sponsored institutions and other groups is not enough for the increasing population in the camp.
They argued that the compiling stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for the needy.
A court in Lille said there is no legal basis for deportation of people who run the 72-degree grading store, but the concerns of the governor of Calais are "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have taken a much bigger role than just feeding people who live under "extremely dangerous conditions."
These areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers, he said.
For Jungle Children, one of the places in danger of collapse, the Book Cafe offers 200 meals a day, gives English and French lessons and advisors here to hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this cafe for children.
In a letter sent to the Guardian, the closing process was "a disaster for these children, who are only eight years old."
The two charities, Help Refugee and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted on Friday that after increasing arrival during the summer, the population at Jungle camp (above 9,000) had emerged (above the highest number so far).

The dramatic progress in the Rugby 7th Championship of Great Britain ended on Thursday after the 43-7 defeat at the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji taught skill in the concept, rust, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to receive the gold medal, which is the first Olympic medal in every color.
After the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a non-bad consolation prize and could now be proud of their efforts at the Olympic 7th opening tournament where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African team, which they beat by 7-5 in the semi-final, could have found them in the final.
But still, a Fiji, who was so fit, could defeat a team of 15.
Although it may not be very believable, perhaps the Great Britain will find comfort in thinking that at least one Britannia will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight miles ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this disaster is painful, progress has been truly surprising.
Fiji made a fascinating start, and the players kind of bounced over the great Britain's attempts to take the ball.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and when the World Series champions took off from the corner, Osea Kolinisao stepped forward 5-0.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai crossed the right wing with another number.
The game was 12-0, and the Great Britain had barely touched the ball yet.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third, like a mountain, but it was only to delay Fiji's number.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
With only one minute left to finish the first half, Nakarawa made another number in the first place.
Then Vatemo Ravouvou flew through some difficult British interventions to the line for numbers.
The score between this number and the circuit has reached 29-0.
When Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th Championship, the Great Britain seemed to be still trying to learn the basics.
It's more or less like that.
Great Britain has made great changes between the circuit and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good development with the first half, until Josua Tuisova performed with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton did an experiment for Great Britain, and even though he tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7, game fans were in the hands of South Sea Islands, singing, waving and dancing.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from beginning to end.
Maa Viliame has also worshipped the final addition of the game Fiji, which does not need to decorate in the last few minutes.
When the whistle went off, the Figians started celebrating and Great Britain took the way to the dressing room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-final, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a difficult semi-final, and Britain stepped forward with one number.
Kyle Brown put up the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton got ahead with the dizzying foot movements in the second half.
The victory and silver medal were guaranteed by Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was on the first 15 of England.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by their trainer's struggle with cancer and ran to victory in the shovel.
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, and that means something.
After 220 painful breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they gained gold in Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two people pulling the shovels, there were three voices on the boat, while their trainer Robin Williams's voice was echoing on the boat this year, as the first women to reach such a level in England this year.
Their dominance was quite clear; this was the 39th race of their unprecedented series of undefeated.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in the swan elegance, this image does not fully reflect the quality of victory.
Behind each shovel gold medal, there is a battalion of willing hands that provide this difference, and no hand was as effective as its trainer who didn't know if he was going to live long enough to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and left.
I got bladder cancer that could be operated on, and they did it.
If they don't do it, it goes everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
That changes the way you look at life.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was lucky to be able to start treatment in the early 2014 of the season, but such a distraction will be minimal.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and even though they said it was enough for me to take a few steps, I was walking in the garden about six, nine, 15 meters.
That's how it started.
The rowing is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After victory, Williams had a nervous morning with a little more talking than usual to overcome his own concerns.
"I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe that's a little extreme, but it really means a lot," Stanning said, a captain at the Royal Gunnery Union who had gone to Afghanistan before.
It emphasizes what this means to me, and once again how hard Helen and I and Robin work.
I spent three great years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, neither would we, so I'd like to thank her for being the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better trainer to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The two have reached a difficult rhythm that their opponents cannot reach.
Even in the last 500 meters of New Zealand and Danish teams, Stanning and Glover had not run out of power yet.
That's when we got carried away.
Helen called out, "Watch the process, watch the process."
It's really important not to go or not.
We had a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We didn't expect the fireworks to explode today, we just wanted to win the race that we went out with good shovels, which we did.
The two will take a year off before they decide what to do with the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, the wedding of himself and television adventurer Steve Backhall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That was going to be a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
That was so new, and I was so stressed out.
Here, that took about four minutes.
This feels so much better. "

Bulgaria has announced its First Defa inflation Values for eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation in Bulgaria was at 1% in June.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012), but last year, after 0.2% of positive value, it has been the first over zero since October.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI (August 2015 - July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate has been 0.2% since the beginning of the year (December 2015), and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 has been 0.2%.
According to the previous month in July 2016, price growth was observed in the following consumer products groups: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various and services (0.3%).
The shoes and shoes (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1%) have dropped prices.
Alcohol drinks and tobacco moules, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels -- prices in communication and education groups remained at the same level.
Snapchat "Anime" Efecti was criticized as an Asian cartoon
Although Snapchat said it was inspired by animes for this filter, some observers say it was racial insensitivity.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality every day with the lens tool to play with their absurd identities.
If it's a pineapple, you can turn yourself into a dog or a Roy Lichtenstein character.
The lenses are reckless, characteristic-altering tools that create over 30 million selections each day.
Wrong steps are quickly carved into the memory of the clan.
Snapchat lenses faced accusations in the past that applied supported black classification or that white skin tones were presented as a beauty ideal.
Therefore, due to the lens they presented this week, which made users flabby, broken teeth and fat cheeks, some critics criticised that it was an Asian mask that caricaturized the Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring conflicts pointed to a bigger problem with the company's diversity.
News and anger spread with the news of The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and one day, Snapchat announced that he had removed property.
The company said: Mercek was prepared not to caricarize the Asians, but to pay tribute to the anime characters.
But for observers with racial experience, this lens reminds me of the painful stereotypes.
Other people generally refused to compare it to anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, and she wrote a lot of tweets about photographs, said the lens was "painful and uncomfortable" in an e-mail.
"When it comes to comparing the effects of the bad Asian cartoon and the filter, it is difficult to argue.
Which means the filter isn't just an Asian mask, but also a humiliating Asian mask.
Snapchat is not the only company beyond cultural trigger mechanisms.
The American culture appears to be in endless conflict with diversity and inclusion in many areas, from institutions' conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the vast young mass, which Snapchat calls for, more racial diversity than other opponents, may be in a higher sense of sensitivity.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses created a humiliating image for a user, "such actions are much harder not to be noticed as they used to be."
On Thursday, Mrs. Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete Snapchat account and called everyone in that direction.
In his article for Medium and on the phone interview, he said he believed that conflict with race reflects lack of diversity in employment practices in Snapchat.
Miss Zhu, the majority of the company criticized the leadership team of white men and ended his article with a label: # Snapchatislin.
"Since different races are not sufficiently diverse among their staff, they can make decisions like that, or even though they work there and belong to different races, they don't feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to themselves," said Mrs. Zhu, an American of China.
Other observers share their views on this complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not share numbers of diversity between its staff by emphasizing its special company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the racial origins of his staff, but according to a spokesman, the company added a job responsible to focus on populations that had not been represented recently and to increase their efforts in internal integration.
"I wonder if they need more users like us to say it's not true."
The Council of Congress has said that the Military authorities have ruled ISIS Intelligence out
A congressional panel announced on Thursday that US Central Command officials have disrupted intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
A period of report by the Palace's Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Councilor Subcommittee's Republican board heads found that their superiors were "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command Intelligence analysts who said the US forces had changed the assessment of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Fla, which controls the operations of the American army in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders typically draw a positive picture of the United States's efforts to prevent terrorism, and consistently provide more positive results than the analysis of other members of the intelligence community."
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happened in Centcom is unacceptable; our warrior troops are suffering while presenting bad analysis to senior decision makers."
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also gave details of permanent problems in 2014 and 2015, including Central Command's explanation and analysis of America's efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the changes of reports, analysts have been pressured by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic perspective on the threat created by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and DAEF.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than fictitious events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack for Musul to be reinstated could be launched in an early period, as early as April or May 2015.
Musul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of research," said Mike Pompeo, the Republican Representative of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States manipulated the commander's intelligence results to make the threat of ISIS in Iraq seem insignificant.
The Republicans found out that analysts expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State has been manipulated, and then formed a working arm.
As the review continues, Thursday's report will be followed by much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence review conducted by the DOD general inspector.
Democratic members of the Palace Intelligence Committee also published their own findings on Thursday that included some results of the Republican labour arm.
Democratic head of the committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, said, "From 2014 to 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow-minded process of intelligence assessments on the DAEK and the Iraqi Security Forces."
According to Mr. Schiff, the process "delayed the broadcast of the intelligence results" led to a moral disorder among analysts and "has not included enough opposition views."
However, Mr. Schiff and Democrats have said that the White House has not been pressuring the results of the Centcom analysts to "predetermined or political statement."
The preliminary results of the Congress review were announced by Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector's general review was available following complaints filed by Centcom analysts.
High Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, stated that during a period of further examination of the general inspector, the Ministry of Defense will not comment on the congress report.
However, he said that experts may disagree over the interpretation of complex data in some cases and that the intelligence community and the Defence Ministry support healthy dialogue regarding these important national security issues.
Research will wake up an echo beyond the question whether the US bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues (an argument raised by more Defence officials every day).
However, last year's charges have uncovered President Obama's question of how much he can rely on Central Command for the honest assessment of military operations at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics of the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began while Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article that said that President George W. Bush administration had defended a small force in Iraq, despite many analysts' objections, and that he hadn't thought enough about the rest of the occupation in 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the rebellion on Islamic State intelligence.
Officials have concluded that despite the opposition public statements of Mr. Hooker's team last year, air attacks against the refineries owned by the Islamic State have not affected the terrorist group's financial resources in a significant way because they built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, as The Times stated in September, this findings did not go outside the Central Command.
Centcom's former commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year for being seen as an extremely positive assessment of the war by many lawmakers.
General Austin retired in April and replaced him in Central Command, General Joseph L. Voto.
The United States Women's Grass Hockey Team, prepared to meet Britain, won its fourth victory in the rear.
The day after Katie Bam scored three goals in the 6-1 victory against Japan, she scored the first two goals of the United States women's hockey team in Thursday, when Americans defeated India 3-0.
Although five goals in two games seem to require a permanent skill in the mind, Bam (27) said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that the Americans are leading the Olympic tournament 4-0 and share the first line in the group with Britain, which has been undefeated on Thursday after defeating Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will face the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams are entitled to a quarter final, and the match will determine who will finish the six-team games first and who will finish second.
The team that finished the group games first will not face the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, a little longer when the quarter finals begin.
But after Saturday's game, the Americans created a staggering sensation following the last London Olympics where they came from 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa. He was three years old when he first took the lawn hockey stick (his twin sisters were interested in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at 16 and became the youngest player in the team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he couldn't get into the last cast.
And then it came in 2012, when most things didn't work out for him and his teammates.
Next year, an English coach Craig Parnham was recruited and things started to change.
Bam says, "A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change."
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We're totally through transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam received the first count of the first half with a close backstroke.
India has not yet won a victory in the tournament, but the team has managed to maintain the score as 1-0 until the third quarter where Bam took action.
He made a long run to the left of the field, and then he rolled up and threw the ball into the castle and put the Americans in the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first game that Jackie Briggs, the US goalkeeper who allowed a goal in the first three victories, didn't get a goal in the tournament.
His luck has been opened.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now," but it depends on how good this place is on Saturday's game.

Far from the center, there are spores partially ununiversal in the shadow: cool rifle shooting, archery, badminton, tekwondo.
The frog will always be with us, and I hope it will be for a long time.
But personally, I'd like to draw attention to the secret magic of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced in the Sydney Games, the few I've asked in 16 years had not realized it was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes for the competition, he never won a medal in his trampoline, and by 2012, he didn't have a competitor rising to the finals.
In men, the Chinese and the Russians, the women, the Chinese and the Canadians tend to share their rewards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to protect the gold medals they bought in London this year.
However, the trampoline is a bit of an ancient event; it may be because it is partly considered that it is worthy of clown school instead of Olympics in unconscious ears.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the matter.
It has a funny potential (like the cartoon-like tremor of the never-ending leap), but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which basically brings together two sports.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "hand trampoline," which means "tramplin."
In a big trampoline, the champions jump almost 30 feet above the air and ask them to do a series of moves (burkma, Pike and Salto) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to labor, difficulty and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men, 16 women, will fight in Rio.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly forward.
Those who hope to receive medals must go further, further and higher in some cases, until the end point in their search for gold.
They're not just after the finish line or the starting wall, but there's another tough line on TV; the world or the Olympic record.
This ambitious effort is enough to drown a spectator in tears at noble, coveted and even extreme levels.
But that's just what I find slightly exhausting when I watch the Games.
Trambolin allows you to take a break from all this.
Trampoline's moving up.
Their targets are not moving forward.
He jumps up, goes up like an astronaut, goes down and goes back up with no trouble.
Of course, there's no competition or difficulty, but there's no hummed work, no disappearing away in order to get to the bottom of the routine, just a subtle suspension of time and gravity.
The more calm an Olympic race can be, the more calm it is.
Women's rankings and finals will be held Friday afternoon at 1: 00 p.m. Eastern time; men will be back on Saturday at 13: 00.
NBC will release finals in both days from 2: 00 p.m. on the afternoon block.
In the middle of Olympic madness, they offer a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in general.
And if consciousness, according to The Wall Street Journal, is going to increase only by offering male athletes to objectify and objectify, as the United States male gymnasts recently suggested, Mr. Dooley expects new fans.
In Ethiopia, which has long been the United States Allied, "A generation in Protest."
Violence Protests in Ethiopia
Representatives demanding political change in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say several protesters received fatal gunshot wounds in a police conflict.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past ten years, he has been one of the most stable nations in Africa and has become a solid ally to the West with his rapidly growing economy.
However, anti-government protests over the past few months have spread to more areas every day and shaken the country.
Only last week, thousands of people went out on the street asking for basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to that was pretty brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
In recent years or early this year's protest footage, security officials have been flogging young people who have to hold their hands against a wall.
The top-level UN human rights official wants a thorough review right now.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and it will be much harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, director of the International Crisis Group's Somalia Peninsula project director.
After Ethiopia, Nigeria, Africa's population is one of the highest nations and its stability is appreciated by the West.
US military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats in the region, especially Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that are helping so much from the West.
Ethiopia's economy grows dramatically.
The infrastructure has been effectively improved; there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa, capital.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not shown in Ethiopia (human rights groups repeatedly refer to the government's pressure attitude), the domestic opposition was limited, the opposition was effectively silenced.
Most were sent to exile, imprisoned, killed or banished to the farthest corners of the desert.
But this could be about to change.
Seyoum Teshomme, a university professor from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you drown people and offer them no choice but to protest, these events will happen."
Youth is in total protest.
A generation of protests.
There are a lot of complaints from land use to pressures imposed by the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's election of considerable criticism, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by dissidents, and now they can control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border are increasing with Eritre, the sharp and controversial line that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will be rearmed by exploiting this turbulence in recent years.
There are several factors that explain why the painful feelings that have been boiling beneath the surface for years have now been exploding.
First of all, it looks innocent: smart phones.
As cheap smartphones spread and provided internet service, only a few years ago, he began to communicate with large Ethiopian social media.
Even when the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protest times, most people could communicate through Internet proxy servers covering their positions.
A few young Ethiopians said that's how they gathered for protests.
Secondly, the solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, Oromolar and Amhara, has also increased.
The Oromolar and Amhara are not normally allies.
For a long time, Amhara, a Christian, has been exploiting the Oromos, which are mostly Muslim and flat fields, from the mountainous regions of Ethiopia.
But that changes too.
Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromo, said, "We are on our way to co-operate under an umbrella."
The biggest protests were seen in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia has been unjustly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which constitute about 6 per cent of the population and dominates military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unexplained disease in 2012.
It was thought to be a tactical genius who saw that no one could see.
Analysts say he specializes in identifying and neutralizing competitors especially the first signs of unrest.
"The current regime does not have that basic information," said Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected in a relatively uncertain way to replace Mr. Moles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is south.
Analysts say he failed to gain confidence in security services controlled by Tigras.
As a result, there was more blood spilled with more fear.
Ethiopia's last experience in such a mix-up was the protest of thousands of analysts following the government's sloppy election in 2005.
In the measures following this, although less than last month, many protesters have been killed, and this period of confusion has been relatively faster.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their vision infrastructure planning and significant progress in fighting poverty, such as the new suburban train.
But it certainly didn't stop the increase in hatred against the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnicity.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigraans, and Tigrayan hatred also increased in social media.
Analysts say protests leave the United States and other allies in the West in a strange situation.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights on neighbouring Somalia, but it was recently said to be closed.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want this ally torn apart in a fragile region.
Mr. Abdi said, "This one," and added, "it's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump explained Obama's claim to form ISIS as "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to eliminate the last conflict around his campaign on Friday, claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders of the Islamic State terror group."
This statement has brought new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
He also put in a strange position in the process when they tried to explain that that's not what he meant by his deputies who were doing everything he could to defend him.
Mr. Trump insisted on Thursday after he proposed at a rally on Wednesday night that the president and Mrs. Clinton really implied that she had founded ISIS.
However, on Friday morning on the Twitter post, Mr. Trump said he only made a sarcastic statement.
His message showed that in a series of interviews, Mr. Trump stepped back completely before the day before, when he expressed serious about this accusation.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded me that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften that comment, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump, after the fall in the polls, the last disturbance occurred when he was trying to change the focus of his campaign.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had conversations this week about the economy in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to it.
Speaking on Twitter again, she said that Miss Clinton's offers would increase taxes and find her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used his sarcasm defense before.
By the end of July, he explained that following the appearance of a pirate attack on the Russians' e-mails, he said, "Of course, I said it in a cynical way."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and step back where he needs to be.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language that both candidates use, said, "This is a pattern that allows certain messages to react by those who support them to make an" explanation "in some way, depending on the reaction.
But at the same time, he gives these statements on purpose, and he knows it's unclear enough to be filtered from different lenses.
After the polls dropped recently, Mr. Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude instead of softening the air for the general selection crowd.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist survey released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was quite behind Miss Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado and there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump refuses to apologize for the provocative things he usually says, he accuses critics of deflecting his words or not understanding his humor.
However, Mr. Trump's jokes, which have been exposed to much more scrutiny in the last few months of the presidential campaign, make it difficult for the public to support his loyal supporters, as provocative as their comments are.
Former mayor of New York City Rudolph W. Giuliani did his best to defend the island in an interview with CNN on Thursday as one of Mr. Trump's leading supporters.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's doing a legitimate, political criticism."
In a way, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown small organization, and the people who found them lovely were completely wrong, and that was because the soldiers were pulled out of Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to argue that Ms. Clinton's foreign ministry, Obama administration, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East, and caused ISIS to grow.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to accuse the media of twisting every word and being biased against him on Twitter.
"Poor, pathetic," who tried to solve himself, laughed at TV experts and said, "They can't do that!"
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's alibi, saying it was evidence that he was unfit for president.
Once upon a time at the cafe Greenpoint, which can't cope with prices, it's back with us.
In Williamsburg, Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, an old-fashioned place that only works in cash, offered great coffee for 15 years, even though it wasn't connected to Verb Cafe Wi-Fi.
Naturally, he couldn't handle prices at his store in Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store replaced Verb sells soap shaped like Soap Cherie.
Local residents were close by expressing that this was the latest loss of the neanderous city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is evacuated and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is as much a reinventing city as it is a change.
In Greenpoint last November, less than a mile from its original position, a renewed Verb Cafe opened in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit card, but it protects some of its former employees and similar basic air.
Coffee's still good.
At the beginning of the new Verb, Cisco Rodriguez, the former cafe's long-term employee, is also the owner and director of the new place.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
A client said he'd be excited to do it when you offered him funding for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for bagels and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he'd like to offer some different experiences.
He added new supplies.
Pastrami-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, with ingredients such as capers and scrambled onions.
They have brown-rice bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but it offers fresh fruit water.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former regulars had begun to arrive decisively.
He said, "Many of our former clients couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg."
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he didn't stop moving on this road.
Verb said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after closing.
He said, "I noticed that what I love is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now he started drinking coffee again, but he chose the mixture of cheetah with a new plugin instead of regular iced coffee the other day.
Another client, Tom Rosenthal, went to Verb regularly since 2003.
He used to go there before work and order the same order.
He said, "Every day, after a quarter past seven, I would go in without a surprise, and they would prepare my order of butter every day."
The photo, Mr. Rodriguez, said he wanted to make a change and added new materials to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, but sometimes he makes a difference by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to his usual bagel order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he was not upset about the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cold coffee of the cafe.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept that offer."
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents adopted this cafe.
One of the new clients translated the menu to Lehçe, and Mr. Rodriguez said he would soon find a place to display this menu to make his new neighbors feel better.
There are other advantages to the new position.
Local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold-made coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will be expanded by spreading to the adjacent building.
For most clients, even a new Verb is available, where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said it made him feel at home to come in and get coffee.
He said, "I had to smell it."
"A Square Meal" by the Depressant Food of Crisis Time
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at lunch at the Oval Office, right after he sat in the presidential seat.
President Roosevelt, who was fond of his throat, loved his fancy Fifth Avenue food, like goose butter and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu that day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a dry plum pudding for dessert.
Jane Ziegeman said, "This was an act of solidarity with the troubled people about eating."
"This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple who lived in Brooklyn Heights, the food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegeman was describing life in the slums of the Lower East Zone in her book "97 Orchard."
The new book they work with, "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American food during the Great Buhran period.
They also collaborated on the food and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenenberg Sandwich Foundation in Flatiron region since the year the crisis began.
While Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57) chose to sit turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order for meatloaf appropriate for discussion of the crisis-era meals.
Mrs. Ziegeman said, "The salmon were very popular."
He had peanut sauce, liver loaf, dried bean loaf.
These were made of something cheap that spread the material with a material.
Imagine eating you enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he scraped your face.
He said, "Must be sitting in the stomach like a bullet."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the dishes in America were like a buffet.
Women cook for men who work at the farm and serve fresh baked pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In World War I, Americans were sending food to starving Europeans. "A Square Meal" explains the history of how the nation suddenly became a center of abundance.
When Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, he said, "This was a period when food became a central, worrying issue for the Americans."
The new budget regime was equally worrisome: mysterious foods such as salmon and moths have become basic consumption products, according to Mrs. Ziegelman, "moths were a great way to assess the remaining foods" so that cooks could hide an appetite-covered material with cream sauce.
He bought fresh fruit, which was cheaper, dried fruit.
For years, meat found at the center of American food has become a luxurious luxury.
For calories and nutritional value, interesting compounds have been tried and the sense of satisfaction has taken place in front of taste or general cuisine.
While Miss Ziegeman was doing research for her book, including recipes, she prepared onion food in a peanut butter-filled oven.
"This was not a popular contribution to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Mrs. Ziegeman supported it: "That was real."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
In most home economics recipes, it was an emerging feature.
The home economy experts, including the Federal Office for Home Economics, led the country's eating habits from 1923 to 1943, as never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "saved," and proliferated the struggle to turn puzzles into delicious foods, such as carrot cream spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicious bites.
The response to the government's hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's idea of eating cake, is highly appetizing.
While he was singing simple Iowa farmers' meals as a public child, he was eating like a millionaire intellectual he turned into.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat European cuisine tastes like a cucumber-sauce fish."
He was eating his food in a dining room with almost all gold-plated jackets fit for dinner.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to be an example of his stomach, President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake.
According to the book, with Mrs. Roosevelt hiring an undertaker who doesn't care about taste, the White House has not only begun to offer "the saddest foods ever prepared, but also the most depressing dishes."
After the country was back on its feet, most of the way to cook during the crisis has been put aside.
According to Miss Ziegelman, the process of calorie and feeding and science being applied to cooking.
The couple expressed that while writing the book, Miss Ziegeman learned a lot from her mother's eating habits -- for example, she could never throw food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Mrs. Ziegeman told me about her old memories: "It really made people sick."
There was a case of whipped cream doughnuts.
After the dishes were collected in Eisenenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they made at home: the dry plum that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called a stuffed prune," and added that the most frequently applied number was to give these humble recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream; only dry plum, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitantly dived their brown sticky spoon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
He said to his wife, like someone who could be refurbished, "It would be nice to have a little bit of shrunken walnut."
In the fight against Merck for hepatitis C patent, Gilead will receive attorney fees.
According to the US district judge's decision, Gilead Sciences Inc, the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc has earned the right to receive legal fees for the hepatitis C patent case.
After the US judge discovered that Merck had committed a series of misconduct involving perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was reduced to $200 million in compensation for the violation of two Merck patents related to Sovaldi and Harvoni in June.
At Thursday's trial, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to be compensated for the fees made during the trial defence.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 per cent of liver patients, the owner of the market.
The case is based on the 2013 year when Gilead and Merck sued each other to claim ownership of laboratory studies for the active substance of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces have expressed that Membic's control has been completely taken from the Islamic State.
On Friday, group spokesman said the US-sponsored forces have taken full control of the city of Membic, which is north, near the Turkish border, the last Islamic state warriors within the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are in the process of cleaning up the city after a group of militants hiding in the city.
Şanfan Dervis, an alliance with the SDG, told Routers that over 2000 civilians were released from the Membic Military Council.
He said to Routers, "The city is under complete control now, but we are conducting clean-up work."
The Clinton family won 10.75 million dollars in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday that the Democratic candidate and his wife won 10.75 million dollars last year and paid a federal tax at 34.2 per cent in effect.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charity institutions, mostly the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton won about 5.3 million on speech fees, and the former foreign minister said he had made $3m for his book from the State Department.
Clinton's candidate friend, the US Senator, Tim Kaine from Virginia, published a 10-year tax statement with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3 per cent federal taxes.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Unlike that, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses about his previous tax returns and steps back.
Although it doesn't require laws, it's a tradition for US presidential candidates to present tax statements publicly.
Trump and his lawyers, a businessman from New York, said that the reason for the rejection of the Betas is a audit conducted by the IRS.
In connection with the members of the Democratic candidate, the Clinton campaign officer Ian Sams tweeted "You're next."
On Thursday, Trump's special prosecutor, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the inspection is complete.
In 2012, the group criticised Trump, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, saying that this rejection constitutes a number of other links, including its autonomy, its contributions to charity, business agreements and what happened with Russia.
Clinton released an online video on Friday, showing that senior Republicans were pressuring Trump to explain his taxes.
On Thursday, during an economic speech in Michigan, he expressed the problem.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to publish tax returns," he told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid taxes for almost two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, New York Times business columnist shared statements that a series of tax lawyers and accountants might still be going on like this.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton presented a rule offering that would provide at least 30 per cent of taxpayers per year with the name of billionaire investor Warren Buffet.
President Obama supports that offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett to come to Trump and present its tax bill.
Bucket said he was also passing the IRS audit, and Trump was "afraid of voters," not from the tax collection institution.
Clinton published tax statements in his campaign until 2007.
The Clinton family currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid average federal tax at approximately 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton family's statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income came from wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost investment fund, and the Clinton family has stated that interest revenues are 109,000 dollars.

Dust-chili condoms, chestnuts, support the protection of elephants in Tanzania.
The environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw them condoms filled with powdered pepper.
The method was proven effective, and the United States-based Nature Protection Association, which found this idea a few years ago, stepped forward to promote it; it began to train volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-violent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many people have used a spear to defend themselves before.
On Friday, Earth Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we developed the tool set, we have seen that the movement in these communities has changed; they now have more confidence in keeping elephants away from their land without harming elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in one statement.
The first two steps include holding a flashlight and honking the last file.
In case that's not possible, what's called "the red pepper cloud" is being thrown out.
The dust mixed with the soil, the pepper is placed in a condom with a chestnut flare, closing the tip just to keep the fuse open.
When it's burned, the condom opens with an explosion and spits red pepper in the air in dust.
One breath is enough to send elephants in the opposite direction.
The last option is to use a catapult that throws fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish film producer knocked down the hotel in Berlin, which lifted Israel's phone code on the Arabs' request - RT News
A Jewish French film producer revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that the employee suggested "demands" by Arab clients, led to stagnation in the media.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary "Shoah" on genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin with a clear letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel in his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed in Berlin, the capital of new Germany?
It's written, Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel through its own call center.
Film producer reported the situation at the hotel reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was "shocking him."
The hotel secretary said it was taken by "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski-Hotels administration."
The reason why he was under this move caused the filmmaker to get a lot angrier.
According to Lanzmann, most of our guests said they wanted to delete the code of the Arab and Israel.
According to Sudeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described it as "a great shame."
We were horrified by this situation, and it was very surprising.
This is a real shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this is a far greater disgrace.
That doesn't have to be explained.
We're waiting for the hotel to come up with the result. "
The incident has caused a huge reaction in the online environment; people have described it as a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "obeying the so-called demands of Arab clients."
Another shipment stressed that the hotel was located near a synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street and said, "You should be ashamed."
Der Spiegel reported that the hotel quickly dismissed these charges by saying it was a result of "reckless" and apologized to Lanzmann.
Sudeutsche Zeitung said that one of Kempinski's representatives said "There has never been a direct order not to be included in Israel's speed search list."
And now they've added the code.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesters
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to perform a demonstration against government reforms on the public education system.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem started when the police were trying to distribute the students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students joined the show to express their discontent with the plans.
According to the proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo, less than 100 public schools will be closed for savings and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the members of the protest have been seen writing against temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest protest took place a few days after protesters went out in mass to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended by the vote of the country's Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased to 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the removal of sanctions and trade cycle between Moscow and Tehran grew at 70.9 per cent per year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest of Russian companies in the country has been greatly increased, he said.
While new companies are preparing to provide access to the market, Russian companies remain connected to Iran.
Of course, the increased trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co-operation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade cycle between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent, reaching $697 million.
Russia's import from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
This increase in trade has been provided with machine, ground tools and weapons-related instruments, "the envoy said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to arrive in Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic representation in Iran gave Iranian citizens 35,000 visas, mostly for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken. "
At the same time, relatively less Russian visits Iran; this is something the ambassador hopes to change.
"I personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where ancient Persian civilization's monuments are hidden in good condition."
FETÖ cash from İzmir - Economy News
An interesting detail has begun to come into light about the President of the Vavular Group Board, Abdullah Kaluk, and the Board of Directors of the Small Bay Group, Ahmet Kıbay, who was detained because he provided financial support for FETÖ.
Fethullah Gülen, head of FETÖ / PDY terror organization, was determined to send a large amount of money every month with courier, FETÖ and Kafuk's financial sources number 1 and 2 in İzmir.
The money sent to Gülen to avoid the record was not deposited on banks, it was sent through an organization member courier.
Meanwhile, nine people were arrested, including Merziron Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Fatih Altıay, who was sent to court under investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt in Amasia, and seven people were released on probation.
30 grand in cash in 10 years.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call for "lower interest," the banks are on the move.
The banks were proposed to include the campaign transfer launched by the real estate council and later attended by the GYODER.
The proposal to lower the interest rates of housing loans, considered as a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks have moved housing loans to less than 1 per cent.
They had public banks starting the discount.
Given the monthly interest rates that have changed between 1.12 per cent and 1.29 per cent before, the consumer using a 10-year housing loan will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
_
And how much advantage will interest prices give to the people who buy houses?
A person who uses a 10-year loan for 100,000 pounds will give you 30,000 pounds of credit from the fall in interest.
Most of the people who use housing loans choose a 5-10-year payment plan.
The interest rates are expected to be lower in the coming days.
Acquisition sales will also be positive.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 per cent according to the previous year, becoming 1 million 289 grand.
This year, sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million in interest reduction.
GODER President St. Torun: Should be lowered below 9 per cent a year
Public banks going to a interest discount is an important step.
They listened to our president's call and downloaded interest.
However, this rate should be lower than 9% a year.
If this reduction process continues, we intend to extend the 0.70 interest campaign we started for a few months.
Lamb Group YKU Özen Lamb: Our campaign can last three months
The fact that banks join this initiative to bring life to the economy that we limit as a month could bring up the continuation of this historic campaign for at least three to four months.
However, credit rates need to go down to under 9 per cent year-on-year.
With positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity in the housing sector and the real market, it's a pleasure to see that every sector is sacrificing in housing purchases.
Polat Holding SKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step for our president to go to a interest discount on a call to the banks.
Other than that, there are steps to revive the economy in all sectors.
The NGOs campaign, the Central Bank's decision, and all the steps taken in that direction are for the country...
All banks have to put their hands under the rock.
Come to them and join this campaign, with us, on the same path, together, we say, "Let's die for the economy."
5.5 billion dollars in 1.5 years from Sabancı
In the first six months of this year, Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 per cent according to the same period last year and increased its sales by 1 billion 353 million liras and increased by 22 per cent to 17 billion 166 million lire.
Sabancı Holding High Manager (CEO) Victory Survival announced that in the first six months of the year they invested about 5.5 billion pounds in the beginning of 2015.
"As a country, we have been through a difficult turn recently."
"From now on, it is time for more work and production for our country."
Take two years off from Kabatay
Due to the construction of "Kabatal Square Edition, Transferation Centre and the Regeneration of Piers" conducted by İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB), Kabatal vapur docks have been closed to sea traffic for nearly two years.
There will be a modern transfer center on the coast of Kabattaş that will integrate sea, rail system and highway transport.
Traffic will be underground, providing uninterrupted pedestrian flow along the coast.
The tram and futuricular systems will continue to work for a while.
The ring flights will be launched in order to ensure the arrival of citizens, Taksim, Eminön, Beşiktaş.
The interest fell, the house grew
My friend, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same thing.
The interest is dropping, the price of the house is increasing.
The interest is rising, the price of the house is dropping.
He says, "Look, this is what happened again."
His job is about individual loans, so he tells me about his feelings.
The contractors entering the 0.70 interest-rate campaign organised by the Real House say they increase prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there was any truth to it.
There's no shortage of circumstances, there's no more...
In the meantime, I was reminded of a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit of our newspaper a week after the Fethullahist Terror Organization's coup attempt on July 15th.
The boss of a big company...
When I heard the contractor say, "Actually, prices need to be raised by 10 percent," I said, "Are you going to be a coup artist?"
Following the coup attempt, builders launched a major sales campaign with 0.70 interest and 120 months of promise.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we are moving with the spirit of unity and unity to avoid cutting the pace of Turkey.
The banks backed your one-month campaign by downloading interest.
Then no one should get a raise.
And warn them of what they have done.
President Erdoğan has accepted Omar Coach and Ali Coach
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accepted Coach Holding Board President Omar Mehmet Coach and Coach Holding Executive Board Vice President and President Ali Koç.
Erdogan's admission to the press in Presidency has lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDK: Report those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, president of the banking and audit institution (BDDK), has made a statement on President Erdogan's warning of "calling back loans" to banks.
Akben said, "If banks turn the call back on credit to an opportunist due to the conditions of the market, we certainly won't allow it."
We call those who bring this kind of complaint and information to us, 'Name the bank and corporate basis, and apply it to the BDDK complaint line.'
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that when the interest falls, the credit opportunities are extended, we will open a new era in front of both our country and investors and our banks."
As long as we don't allow credit in this period of our country, banks who call back on false excuses have set themselves a line, and I'd like to announce that.
When interest rates were 7-8 per year, banks made money.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
At a meeting in the exhibition of EXPO 2016, professional Hotel Directors Association (POYD) President Ali Kızdağ said that Turkey-Russia relations had entered a positive course before the coup attempt on July 15, and that the plane flights from Russia began and had a certain revival in tourism.
"I expect very positive developments for all sectors in both tourism and agriculture, textile, construction textures," he said, expressing that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting also excites the tourism sector as well as trade sectors between the two countries.
Turkey and Russia have two countries that are very close to each other, traditional relations based on years.
"As sectors on this road opened by two country leaders, I think that if we move too fast, we can close the distance and move towards the targets as soon as possible," he said.
Without the coup attempt, Kırdağ said they had predicted that the number of Russian tourists who came to Turkey would exceed 1 million.
But we lost a month in the time we called the high season, so we're talking about the downsizing of the target.
I still think if the charter flights start, we'll outnumber 500,000.
And the season could be extended to the end of October, even in the middle of November.
In a situation like this, there can be additional flights to New Year's Eve.
I'm guessing this positive air will be considered very well by the Russian people.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
With this acceleration, I hope we can push the 700 grand.
Showing that they are hopeful for the Russian market for 2017, Kırdağ said that if the two countries are united, as well as the Russian economy, the number of Russian tourists will rise above 3 million again next year.
"There are returnations in canceled reservations, new reservations have also begun to be taken," said POYD President Kırdağ, saying with the removal of the public staff's permit.
He said, "We have a hopeful expectation of the feast of sacrifice."
"It would be nice if we could bring 100 or 200,000 people from Iran in 1.2 months," Kırdağ said, saying the removal of the tour ticket ban to travel agencies after the coup attempt.
Refresh the current loan?
First of all, talk to the bank where you get a loan and find out how the new interest conditions affect your credit.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest (usually 1.5-2 per cent of the current fee) from your bank.
If you still have the advantage when you include all the costs, you can apply for low interest credit use.
No breathing for the Lion!
The final champion, Beşiktaş, is aiming to win the Super Cup fight with Galatasaray and enter morale in the new season.
"We must play with tempo and aggressive" in a meeting with the Sun's demands, which set all their plans on victory.
"I'm waiting for a high pass percentage of you and a 90-minute ball check."
The Senol Sun, initially known as Sosa, was unstable about Adriano and Quaresma, who did not intend to drive the players who took their training into the field.
The experienced trainer tried Necip at the stadium during the week, but if Adriano plays on the left-hand wheel, Tosic will serve in the stadium.
The Sun, which will make a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also made his demands run the ball after a long break.
Tolga will explode - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Ozbek answered the questions of media members at the dinner held by the NeF, which sponsored Galatasaray last night, and his transfer also supported the group footballer Tolga Luncci, whose annual fee was discussed.
I DON'T WANT FUTBOLICES TO COVER
"However, football players need to talk about it, not me," Dursun Özbek said, adding that the football team has become much better than last year.
Let me see the teams for two or three weeks, then I can tell you our chance to win.
I'm waiting for an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga in his posture, his physique, this year he'll blow up, everyone will watch with admiration.
The president of Galatasaray stressed that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period, but that they would act if he did not agree with the club, and said, "We were not meant to be loaded so that our opponent could increase prices."
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a master athlete.
If he didn't get along with his club, we'd like to transfer him to Galatasaray.
_
"We wanted to build a room for 13,000 people," Özbek said, saying they will soon start building the hall next to TT Arena.
However, our president said, "Build a room for 15,000 people."
We changed the project.
With the money from Riva, we'll close the bank debt.

"We will share this offer with TFF," he said.

Fired account-book
On June 11, 2015, the FBI sent Pereira, whose two-year signature was signed at the end of the year.
President St. Yıldırım and the board held a meeting, including the club's Financial Co-ordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic extent of the meeting was laid on the table.
According to the deal with UEFA, Yıldırım, who was sensitive to keeping "annual damage" at a level, reportedly received assistance from Yelkovan on financial issues.
Pereira's representatives have been contacted.
His mission has been called to an end.
2-2.5 MILLION ON EURO
Some points still unresolved in financial matters are found, so the official statement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to practice with the team yesterday because there was no official explanation.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, the F.Garden will provide a deal with a number under this statement for evacuation, it was said.
If the FBI pays Pereira's fee in advance, it will end a number between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
Pereira will be paid monthly if she does not comply.
If he makes a deal with a team, this payment will be cut.
Yeah, well, Pereira finally left and the Fenerbahçe fan signed a major revolution.
In the war with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued with a slight injury.
I'm going to be very happy that Vitor Pereira is gone, and I think our administration will go and find worse.
My joy lies in my wolf.

FETÖ leader Gülen's assets have been confiscated
Adana Public Prosecutor's Office for Terrorism-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation has issued a lawsuit against Adana 2 Heavy Court of Criminal Court on 17 suspects, which has been filed against the Court of Adana's Court of Criminal Court on 17 suspects, which has been illegally increased its value in the changes made in the construction plans by individuals and organizations linked to FETÖ / PDY.
In the case of Fethullah Gülen, the number one defendant, being charged with "Excluding the Constitutional Order," the court board issued a warrant to arrest the defendants, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were on the run with Gülen.
However, for the four defendants who have not been caught and have not come to trial, the court has decided to conduct illegal proceedings.
The Adana 2nd Heavy Criminal Court ruled that Fethullah Gülen, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were on the run in order to ensure that the case against them would be finalised, "under the Law of Criminal Procedures (CMK)," decided to seize all assets by the Law of Criminal Accounting (278 / 1). "
Along with this court's decision, they do not move in Turkey, land-sea and air transportation vehicles, they will receive all kinds of rights and rights, precious documents, company shares, safety deposit boxes and bank accounts have been frozen.
Hüseyin Gülar: Gülen's collapse depends on three feet falling
Hüseyin Gülar, who commented on FETÖ's coup attempt, has made dramatic statements.
From the statements of Hüseyin Gülar, the heads of the lines are as follows:
As I thought they were going to take a hit, I wrote in my writings for the last five or six months, "They can attempt but they can't do it in the chain of command."
I didn't know two things; the first one is that it's common and deep on this scale, such as the eight-year officer of the general general general general of gendarmerie, and the relics of the President.
Mr. President, the person who fought the most, who knows how to pay attention to their vows, but the most important thing about them is an unprecedented secrecy.
They're so two-faced.
One of the most important evidence of "This is not what a retired governor like FETÖ can do" is that it's such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA confiscated this person too soon.
In 2014, Mahmut Tağür said that in 1971, they met at Vehbi Coach's house Fuat East and Fethullah Gülen.
The most interested people in these things in that era are the closest relationships between the MIT and the CIA.
The United States paid for our armed forces staff, and then one guy came out of it after they didn't remember.
When do we learn that, 2014?
After this article by Mr. Mahmoud, there was no explanation that denied it.
For example, Fair Orphan, caught on top, didn't he?
Wonder who that is.
The guy went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, came back two days ago.
Fair orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, this needs to be investigated; which one of them went to the United States with an excuse from March 1999, when all the fugitives are going to Fethullah Gülen.
It will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania at some point.
But their real contact with the CIA can be detected from here, especially from people who need to be raised safely to the United States.
It's in the WikiLeaks documents; it's making a laughing association, and it's a joint meeting with the CIA.
Work was done 15 years ago to illustrate those connections with the CIA.
I told you Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works at the Prime Minister works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad thing is, this information fell into the CIA, just like it landed in Pennsylvania.
Gülen's collapse depends on the collapse of three feet; one of which we call a base, which is a friendly ring, and there are some in deep hypnosis, and they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
Three feet, one base support.
The theft of the questions, the theft, the defeats of the slave rights, this base support has been very shaken.
Other two feet; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing to break political support is that Baykal and MHP executives are documented that their tapes are being pulled by FETÖ.
After July 15th, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu used "FETÖ" as well as opened everyone's eyes.
Smiling is such a trickster who says, "I'm not doing it, I'm doing it around."
He says, "Mr. Hussein, these girls are having very different dreams, they send them to me, I forbid them now because it's not right to work with dreams."
A recording of a voice was dropped, and the person who spoke on that audio tape, Barbaros Court: My teacher, they had a dream, double the tweets.
A police martyr in Nusaybin
According to information, the armored car, which was run by police patrol in Saladin Eyyubi, was fired by terrorists with long-shot weapons.
In the first fire, a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists have been neutralized in a conflict against police response.
The wounded police have been removed to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are underway in the area.
Stopped the coup, the TV broadcasts didn't stop.
On the night of July 15th, private television, which had a significant stake in preventing the coup attempt, continued the broadcast through a heroic technical staff in Turksat.
That hero Asim Akkaya...
"I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire that opened from the helicopter," Akkaya said, expressing that they entered resistance psychology under order to cut the broadcast during the reading of the report.
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut the air.
I just turned off the local TV.
Then I let them get away from the building by telling them we had to go to the dish antennae.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
He said, "I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts."
When the coup failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, the Milky Way brought its experts to the TV.
These terrorists were caught by police arriving at the scene three minutes ago.
Akkaya said that when the coup men returned to the building, he understood that TV broadcasts continued on the phone that came to them in about an hour, and that he had come to the nose of death:
I took over the evening shift at 8: 00 that night.
That's where he trusted us.
A friend of mine was on guard for the E-state and electrical system.
When we met for tea around 11: 00, we flew low and the helicopters crossed over.
There were a few other aircraft flying low again around the helicopter.
We saw your lights.
They were probably drones with images.
They were flying past the Helipcopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and since it's the first time I've seen a flight so close, I called the station.
Then there was a movement.
Looking at the news, we found out the bridge was closed.
At the time, our chief of staff instructed friends who weren't on duty at the time of security to come to the building.
We found out that all the TRT feeds were dropped on the way to the station to get information.
The TRT feeds have been shut down for five minutes.
I called the TRT main control, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said the TRT feeds have returned and the memo has begun to be read.
Our deputy director, Halil Greenilgrass, has requested immediate shutdown of TRT broadcasts under the directive of the general director.
Since TRT 3 has made a wide broadcast on the channel, we've started working to stop the broadcast.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say there's an attempt.
Our director's order to cut the TRT has put us in a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut the TRT, then we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter that went down to the station shot everywhere, everyone scattered.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we went back, the soldiers came in from the helicopter.
Some of our friends were captured by soldiers.
So we showed up not to leave them alone.
At the time, I saw them arrest our deputy director and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
'Let's shoot one of them, let them be afraid 'someone said.
Then they let us all in.
Their commander started yelling, "Who's in charge of this place, I won't ask you again."
And when we heard the "let's shoot someone," we thought, "We don't know about the country, but we got an order," cut the TRT. "
So there's a resistance.
At that moment, I felt like I was giving up my own life.
I said, "It's me."
At that moment, I stood up without knowing what to do.
All I could think about at that moment was that my friends from the helicopter were shooting at my friends at the station.
I thought 10 or 15 of your friends were martyrs at the Nizamiye, and when I thought, "They're gonna kill us eventually," I was relieved.
The commander in charge said, "You will cut every broadcast except for the TRT."
We have a system section where we monitor local channels on their way to satellite.
We're moving 80 of the 200 local channels out of this room.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast between them.
If I cut them off and I tell them they're all cut off, at least until then, there'll be backup and outside help.
Or go where he went.
After all, we agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll cut it off."
I cut off one of the local network packages coming out of the antenna.
I cut the power switch to the monitors where we can monitor national channels.
So all the screens would have no signal.
I told her I had to go to the antennae so she could be completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, "Stop there."
He put the gun on my forehead.
'You'll cut them all off except TRT, there won't be any left, I'll shoot one of you eventually, that'll be you. '
So now that I've been through my life, I said, "When she leaves, you'll see them all frozen," and I didn't say anything else.
We went into the station, and I interrupted the local broadcasts.
We've moved on to the other antenna.
At the time, I had a system that would respond to nearly 20 national channels.
When we cut the local channels, about 20 monitors were wasted.
And my Lord helped us, and We did not have any difficulty in answering them, nor did He make them understand.
They believed the answers we gave them.
They didn't push it.
That's a relief.
After they left the antenna, they asked where the traffic was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV publisher," and he said, "Do you have an electrician?"
I said, "There's no electrician after work tonight, if there's a malfunction, the team will be here."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't interrupt the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking about cutting them off to keep the soldiers busy.
They're a little relieved because they think the broadcasts have been cut.
They couldn't think to look at the broadcasts.
Now the band's on hold.
About an hour later, when they turned on TV in the waiting room, they saw A News.
He went in, soldier.
He said, "Sir A News hasn't stopped broadcasting."
We've got eyes on the commander.
He said, "Get up."
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, "There are still ongoing broadcasts."
"There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus," he said.
I said, "They're broadcasting over Cyprus, we can't do anything to them."
And he said, "Then, after we have spoken to one another, he has raised us all up and walked."
The coup squad took a van out of Turksat.
I saw pictures of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water being executed in the seat of that van.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheek.
My friends confirmed you were the same soldier.
They called that soldier 'son' with us.
Probably a soldier.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team in Turksat came from the Shadow.
When the police found out there were helicopters in the area, the guards were being scanned, they went back to the county to get ammunition.
They came back in 40 minutes.
When the police arrived, he couldn't see anyone in the Turkish foreign order.
Only three or four minutes after the police, Akkaya told the so-called experts sent from the Milky Way TV to the building, "They called us to the police teams from inside, we are Turkish personnel, we need to enter immediately."

What I do know is that I haven't really met the Fair Orphan I've known in 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law named Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
He can't live in Turkey like this, nor live in the world.
Let him come and trust Turkish justice.
If he's wrong, he'll pay for it.
He's giving us trouble running away.
Too bad about the police, too bad about the state.
For 20 or 25 days, the police haven't dealt with anything else.
"We need work, not coup," Yıldırım said, saying Turkey does not want to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What are we supposed to do with the coup?"
On the other hand, on July 19th, at 3: 00 p.m., the orphan was lost after leaving his SIR license in Akyaz in the garage of his father-in-law's house.

He saw the emblem in Ergenekon, he killed FETÖ
The Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of FETÖ in the mysterious death of Special Operations Director Behcet Oktay, whose file was closed in 2009, "Suicide."
Former Security Intelligence Agency President Ramadan Akbek, who stayed in the same lobby with Oktay and listened to Oktay under false name as a suspect of the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before he died, is the prime suspect in the investigation.
Some of the munitions seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation are said to have been stolen and buried by the Security FETÖ team from the Special Operations Agency, and that was because Oktay detected it.
Behcet Oktay, who was shot in the head in Ankara on February 25, 2009, was called "suicide."
But there were many questions in the case.
As a result of the legal struggle and evidence by his family and family lawyers, two years later, a murder investigation was launched.
The gun that was said to have been shot by Oktay, the left-handed one, was in his right hand.
Also found fractures to the ribs and contusions on her body.
The case on the murder investigation opened in May 2012.
In the murder case, only the Halil Kesci who was found with him at the time of his death and found traces of gunpowder in his hand was tried.
The cutting trial has finally been acquitted.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor, said he was involved in the death of Oktay, has been sentenced to six months in prison for "taking a crime and deceiving the authorities."
Those SAVCERS, you're welcome.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçin, who called it "suicide," was promoted to Mustafa Stable Supreme Court, who conducted the murder investigation.
The Oktay family wants to investigate the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yıldırım along with these prosecutors.
Behcet Oktay's sister, Sele Oktay, and his brother, Nedik Oktay, have made many demands in the process of trial.
The family said it was impossible for Halil Kesci to kill the specially trained Oktay alone, demanding that the investigation be expanded.
The family said it was covered up by prosecutors Hüseyin Yalçin and Mustafa Dik and Behcet Oktay who wanted to close the file as suicide and to be judged.
While all the demands of the family were rejected, Oktay was heard six days before his death as a member of the Hezbollah Terror Organization by the false name "Abdurrahman Right."
And it was determined that Ramadan Akbek, president of the era's Security Intelligence Agency, was the one who made him listen.
Following this development, the Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office, who reconsidered the Behcet Oktay file, began to examine the finger of the Fethullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The trial against Oktay's illegal rest will begin on September 19th at the Ankara Heavy Criminal Court.
_
The Oktay family, the SABAH, is hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered during the previous demonstration investigation and trial.
"This murder has actually come to the show."
We couldn't detect it.
Before my brother was killed, he said, "They're going to eat me."
I said "Kim."
That's when he pointed to me about FETÖ.
I thought he'd be dismissed.
I never thought of death.
Of course the FETÖ is behind this.
He said, "The administration was in their hands at that time."
The martyr called the young man's family, joined in his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called the family of Democratic martyr Ömer Can Önnez, via the EC Party Sinop MP Nazim Mavis, after speaking to citizens in the presidential Ascension garden during the last night of a break for democratic seizures.
At 1: 30 in the night, Fahrettin Önbek said there was a phone call for his son when they prayed for him, "Our President joined with his prayers."
"I said that our country and its health are important to us," he said.
_
President Erdogan addressed citizens in front of the Presidency Pension the other night.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Küsli after his speech at midnight.
Following the hand of an old aunt who came to the democracy watch, Tayyip Erdogan spoke to the citizens one by one, took care of the children, thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdogan later called Fahrettin Ömer Can Özbek, father of EC Party Sinop MP Nazim Mavis.
"When I said that we prayed for my son and martyrs," Fahrettin Ömer Can, 21, a student of law school at the University of TOBB, said during the night, saying, "Our President also joined with his prayers when I said we prayed for my son."
So I said that our country and its health are very important to us.
"We are so glad that our President called and prayed on the phone," he said.

The traitor who shot the people was protecting the PKK.
Turkey, who has been struggling to end PKK terrorism for over 40 years, began to emerge on the day when Turkey could not destroy its leaders of the organisation.
The FETÖ militants, who infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, worked on four sides to restrain Turkey.
At this point today, there has been serious doubts and evidence that the FETÖ is behind the critical events such as the Hrant Dink Murder, the Uludere incident, the Russian plane's downfall.
_
During the July 15 coup attempt, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's raid on his hotel in Marmaris and the assassination operation was discovered that the record of FETÖ Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezatash was quite extensive.

The intelligence units have also reported that Gökhan Sönmezatesh's record is extensive.
_
As well as leaking intelligence to the PKK, Turkish fighter planes have not hit the targets fully.
The point that the MİT terrorist organisation gave in the Kandil skirts on the PKK's leading staff was alleged to have been targeted by Gökhan Sönmezatesh.
With the coordinates being changed, war planes launched to destroy the PKK's leading staff have shot the targets on the side, and the leaders of the terrorist organization have been determined to survive.
Intelligence survey revealed that Sönmezatash played a key role in both deflecting targets and escaping PKK terrorists from their location before the F-16s took off.

In particular, a comprehensive cleaning process was launched when it was discovered that military students who were not members of the organization were stolen by FETÖ, were sent out of schools by lightning.
With recent exports, about 33,000 officers will remain behind, while cleaning for the general and the admiral will also be done for these officers.
For that, promotion will be frozen especially in the ranks of the lieutenant to the rank of the colonel.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The file on the 37,000 officers has begun to open one by one.
With a 40-year-old study, soldiers from FETÖ will be discovered.
The officers who are not involved with the FETÖ will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETÖ has been cleared, while the officers' promotion will only be brought up after the investigation.
The investigation is conducted together by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Control Board.
As part of the investigation, officers whose file was filed are being investigated by civilians or by finishing the war school, by their rank, by their promotion, their posts, and their commanders.
It will also be investigated by a 40-year-old study of whether or not they are members of the FETÖ.
Any measures will be taken to prevent officers who have no connection to the FETÖ from being negatively affected by the process.
If there is any doubt, that officer will be brought to trial immediately.
Those who have been identified with FETÖ, and those who have information and documents on them, will immediately be cut off from the military.
During all these procedures, while the therphs are frozen, the examination will be deepened.
There will also be necessary measures for the absence of gaps in post-excretions.
Those who were expelled from the TSK and retired by force will be able to return to their jobs with the same autonomy as the members of the security investigation and their circuit mates.

Pehlivanoğlu: FETÖ poisoned the Türkesh
Retired Captain Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, founder and first head of the MHP, said Türkek was poisoned to death and that one of the family co-operated with FETÖ.
"I haven't told anyone until today, but I had to talk to the soldiers who ripped that image out of Muhsin Basicioğlu's helicopter after they saw that the same soldier was in the coup to kill our president," Pehlivanoğlu said from 1977 to 1997.
Here's what Turkesh's bodyguard said:
In 1997, we went to Germany.
Three days before we got here, we had the hood check-up.
The 33-year-old Burduran doctor who made the check up, Fikret, said, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You have nothing."
This doctor died of a heart attack for some reason a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3rd.
My boss went to Amasia.
On the way back, they called me and went to an engagement in Ankara Hilton.
After the engagement, the Turkish driver calls Alparslan "open the back window."
He wouldn't have made me open a window in his life.
When you open the window, there's a hissy sound.
First they did a heart massage at the Çankaya Medical Center, an electrode, but it was over.
We took her to the Bay Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned him in Amasia.
No autopsy on Turkesh.
His ex-wife, Seval Türkech, will have heard my illness and my words, so he went out and said, "The Turk was killed," and so on.
Man makes fath-i build a tomb, he opens a grave.
They said it was a heart attack.
The tomb of Turkesh must be reopened.
Did Alparslan Turkesh get killed?

His wife Fatma Can said that she had learned the prayer of martyrdom in Şevval, but she had enjoined on him that she should establish this prayer.
Fatma Can, who told me that after the prayer, they watched the news on TV at night and learned about the coup attempt, told me:
We got ready and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we got to the bridge, the tank opened fire on us twice.
We took cover, and then when the tank left, we kept walking.
There was a point on the bridge where a big bus stopped.
There was a lot of people there.
We stood there for a while, we waited.
We thought, what should we do when we can't move forward?
Your gang wanted us to go next door.
I'm guessing by the side, we were a sniper, we became an open target, and he was shot there.
And after four hours of prayer, he became a martyr.
He didn't know about the coup.
A wisdom from Allah.
Give, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take
My wife once said, "If I die, I plant a tree that gives me fruit."
I made this wish by planting a plum tree on his grave.

♪ The sky will be the scene of meteor rains ♪
Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu told the AA reporter that Perseid would reach the highest level on Friday (August 12th), which connects Friday (August 13th) to Friday (August 13th).
With thousands of pieces of solar rays and filming, Esenoğlu said that the comet "Swift - Tuttle" had formed a Perseid meteorite rain that would turn into a natural visual shock.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and that it began to reappear in the world from the 1990s.
"We should be interested in watching such a visual feast from space," he said, expressing that the Perseid meteorite rain can be watched in July and August.
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will contribute to getting to know the universe better," he said.
When it's cold, it's red, it's hot, it's white light.
Esenoğlu noted that some of the pieces that were broken during the asteroid shower would fall into the earth the size of lentils:
Perseid temperatures can rise to 2,000 centigrams.
Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseids produce light in red and white when it's cold in the natural environment.

Low-trained, former footballer Erdoğan
It was the winning alliance of the former football player Recep Tayyip Erdogan, led by the undertrained former footballer, Fethullah Gülen, a widely religious entrepreneur, who founded over 1,000 schools, universities and educational institutions from Texas to Taşkkent.
That's the translation of an article that came out of Foreignn Policy last week.
Erdoğan, a college graduate, is a minor and former footballer; Gülen, a elementary school graduate, has been described as a broad entrepreneur, and these and such articles are often in the Western press, where Gülen followers are clearly praised.
After that, they're trying to explain in their "Why is America and / / or Western opposition in Turkey rising?" sentences that start with "Because Erdoğan..."
It is possible to think that analysts who see Turkey's Western opposition as a Bosnian situation in Erdogan's era are unaware of Turkey's history.
According to statistics, the first ten years of Erdogan can be read as a period in which the Western opposition in Turkey has decreased or remained average.
Because in these ten years, he had a very good relationship with the European Union and the United States of America.
Some of the figures such as Erdogan's criticism of Israel and Israel, the EU's inability to establish a clear policy after the massacre of the Assad regime in Syria and leaving Turkey alone in a refugee crisis, and some figures such as the European Parliament President Schulz, "Erdogan is not our fault," and the fact that the European Parliament's representatives, as well as the European Parliament President Schulz, are being held in a state of war against the United States as well as well as the citizens of Turkey, are being held in a state of Syria, and the United States, are in a state of terror.
Let's just say that we lost 247 people in a bloody coup, and we forgot that our so-called ally, the EU countries and the United States, had no support for our democracy until the failure of the coup, that Kerry had first spoken in his first speech, that they were waiting for the construction of peace and stability in Turkey, that they had made no hits on democracy and the elected government.
So, how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including Turkey, have participated in a protest march because 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris, but no president from any Western country, which was allied to Turkey, despite a month after the coup attempt against the tanks for democracy?
What are we going to say about refugees sending low-level representatives to presidents who come in a couple of times a year or high-level representatives?
How are we supposed to go to all the EU and US ambassadors for the sake of breaking the window of the Hurriyet daily and make sure they do not visit the bombed Turkish National Assembly for solidarity?
If it is remembered that the EU is shaking hands with the coup leader Sisi during the first two weeks of the coup coup in Egypt and raising the coup management in Kerry's post-coup visit, is it too unusual for Western countries to express their concern for Turkey's democracy at every opportunity to support Turkey's democratic resistance?
Yet it is enough that 95% of the people see Gülen as responsible for the coup, to be allowed to live freely in the United States, and now it is enough to piss the Turkish people off.
If the background I'm counting upstairs is added to that, I think the rising West / American opposition is clearly unexplainable with Erdogan alone.
Besides, Erdogan didn't even say he thought the U.S. influence was still in the coup...
So the chest was never a threat.
I wonder if they can play the same page after the night of July 15th, when the Gezi fools who despise their own people, who say, "The Ark is a relief," and they don't think like themselves, and they insult the voters as "the ignorant who scratch their bellies."
After seeing how these people had the state and democracy, I wonder if they were looking for answers to the question, "Where were we wrong"?
But the questions that need to be answered are so many?
The officers who served in various stages until yesterday and were given the right to use the state's weapons suddenly accepted the status of "Traitor" and asked for asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we live in and how obsessed with people leads people to behavior that would be considered perversion.
As for the flooded brains, the coup attempt...
Was there any other way to view Turkey's cities more than to resemble Syria's cities for those who participated in this action?
Why would an officer bomb the parliament of his own country?
We probably shouldn't have fallen into the illusion of waiting for reasonable behavior from the brainless minds of the FETÖ.
The other responsible ones, but let's just know that the FETÖ isn't responsible for everything.
The staff, which presented politics as fighting, hatred and hatred, also contributed to the tragedies that have been committed.
And those who presented themselves as "the Moon" have convinced the masses that all kinds of illegal behavior and even immorality are natural.
When the hands of those who hate their own people were given weapons, we saw how they fired at this people.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying something very simple: on the evening of July 15th in Turkey, he gave 250 martyrs to the FETÖ soldiers, the ruins, the servers, and founded more democracy than saving democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after.
There are three changes in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change has prepared two major phenomena: migration from rural to metropolis and moving these galaxies to the center after being held around the cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I stated that this move was through the subway.
I also emphasized that subway is the most important social change element.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution that road and bridge bring to modernization is easier to understand.
The road comes, the economic and social structure changes.
With us, he's changed the political structure.
I've detected this date with bridges thrown over the Straits in Istanbul since before.
Demirel built the Strait Bridge.
That was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued to move in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now changed to the 15th of July martyrs Bridge.
Even their road routes indicate a relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change route you're being followed by.
Demirel and Özal were intended to melt large masses in the center.
It was about adopting the ideology of the center to them.
The EC Party has not made the third bridge for many years.
Because immigration was driving at full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
There's a system that's a little closed in those areas.
Local governments from the EC Party gave people age, work, social status, and they voted for the EC Party.
So they were asked not to melt in the center, but to gain their political consciousness around the environment, and to come to the center as themselves after that.
The formation was related to the ongoing top cover debate (1992-2002) before the EC Party.
These discussions allowed the masses to accept the obligation of conservative, provincial people not to integrate into the center but to stand side by side.
The EC Party acted in the way I stated after 2002, making the masses political, bringing them into politics, maturing them.
After that, now be careful, the construction of the 3rd Bridge is the same time as the democratic struggle on July 15th.
So history and sociology are consistent.
Let me add another dimension to this: the EC Party's move, which I'm talking about, is not limited only to Istanbul bridges.
Something more interesting is that the EC Party is now integrating the surrounding cities into central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, the Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, Çanakkale 1915 Bridge.
Add roads to that.
Turkey will now reach İzmir from Trakya from another route.
You know what that means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say the EC Party will now take Izmir from the outside, which he cannot take from the inside.
Now Bursa, Çanakkale, now the cities of Thracya will become other cradle and social geography.
That's it!
The 15th of July martyrs are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and merry workout in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahçe continued his preparations for the Grasshoppers during his early morning training.

Practice was completed in narrow-range double-goal games.
Fenerbahçe will continue his preparations with his training this evening.
That person who complained to Gülen about Saint Yıldırım...
There are new developments in Operation Pike for Fenerbahçe.
"A name from the sports world has raised his words to Fethullah Gülen about St. Yıldırım himself."
The lightning said, "One day on the plane, this person said," What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen? "
When this person delivered these words to Gülen, Fethullah Gülen also put them on St. Yıldırım.
Why is he obsessed with St. Yıldırım?
The president of Turkey's most popular club, in this mentality, thought it could harm itself.
He used the phrase, "The sesame case was meant to liquidate St. Yıldırım."
Following these words, a statement came from Faik Light, one of the key lawyers of the Shike Case.
The light went to the Anti-Vision program in Habertusk and announced the person who reported St. Yıldırım to Fethullah Gülen, head of FETÖ.
Here are the words of the Faik Light:
St. Yıldırım is saying something to İhsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
On a private plane on the way from Azerbaijan.
Aziz is a man of humor, and when he criticizes someone, he also says it in the words of a dancer.
Those sinking sentences might bleed a little bit.
Some of them can react to those words.
These words are being raised somewhere.
Towers, relics, so many businessmen go there as if they were going to the Hac, Umre, it's not acceptable.
What do they call it, he's criticizing it very heavily.
Of course that's not the only problem.
By the way, there's a football team thing going on.
Some of the players and executives from the Galatasaray Club are directly connected and Hakan thankfully...
Master Muharrem: The subject of style is different
Master Muharrem, president of the Trabzonsport, has extended the hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
"We are on the side of this country with 79 million," he said, expressing that Turkey's issue is the issue of all clubs.
We have to make a strong stand.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETÖ, if it's unfair, I'll stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"However, the subject of the diversion between Trabzonsport and Fenerbahçe is different," he said.
Victims prices have been announced
The black cloud said, "As a union, we have determined the kilogram price of the live sacrifice dance as $18."
"We have also identified the price of the duet as $17, and the living kilogram of the cow we call a second grade," he said.
Noting that animals that would not be victims last year were also being sold, Karabül said that citizens should be careful when they are taking victims:
Especially animals need to be careful with the ear cube.
And it's important that the animal is healthy.
So they can control the vaccine on the animal's passport while our citizens are taking sacrifices.
And from the looks of it, the victim should be alive and alive, and he must have thrown his feathers off.
And you shouldn't have symptoms of saliva or snot on your face.
In the past years, we've seen non-victims being offered and sold.
An animal with a sacrifice needs to be filled with two years old.
And we can tell by looking at the animal's teeth.
A 2-year-old animal has teeth we call a cover.
But animals whose age is smaller don't grow these teeth.
As a picture, the animal may be large, but the cover teeth may not have come out.
The cover teeth are already bigger than the others, so they're immediately noticed.
Rize Airport to sea
In Turkey, the second airport to be built by sea fillings will be Rize Airport.

This is going to cost 600 million lire.

Very striking statements about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam & Partners law firm investigating international illegal activities of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), wrote an article to the US magazine Forbes, sharing information on how the FETÖ was organised.
"Given how Gülen runs about 150 contractual schools in the United States (charter), it will be clear that the organisation has a highly advanced organizational ability underground," said Amsterdam, adding that Fethullah Gülen, head of FETÖ, runs the organization from his Pensylvania mansion.
Amsterdam stressed that seven months ago, he was assigned to investigate companies and schools connected to Gülen by Turkey, stressing that what he has found so far is "shocking."
Amsterdam included these views in his article:
According to the informants, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy with instructions.
These instructions are usually delivered at face-to-face meetings with Gülen in Poconos.
There's a seven-man management group up on the hill.
This group is transferring instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go from here to regional images, country images, country images, urban images, local images in the provinces, neighborhood images, student homes (light houses) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam announced that the organisation has opened 55,000 jobs worldwide, and that it has the largest contract school network in the United States, and that millions of dollars have been given to these schools every year from taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that most of these funds were directed by members of the organisation and transferred to "selected" contractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with these examples:
Magnolia schools in California were caught paying $700,000 for the annual service contract to the company she shared with the same office, which was connected to Gülen.
Amsterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma for another example.
Amsterdam said this school also paid an extra $3.1 million to the owner, and the auditors also found that the management of the school and the owner were one of the same people connected to Gülen.
Noting that there are similar conditions in the 46-branch Harmony schools that hold the largest place in the Gülen network, Amsterdam has noted that software licenses for smaller companies connected to FETÖ have been paid with pens such as curriculum acquiring.
"These examples show that about 28 million dollars of American taxpayers were abused," Amsterdam underlined that it made each other rich within the FETÖ.
"And this is the obvious part of what we've found so far," he said.
It reminded Amsterdam that nothing has ever been done to prevent such events, that the situation has gotten worse in the last period of time, that the Texas Education Agency has begun to investigate irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools are functioning normally in sight, that many employees do not have any information on what kind of corruption they are.
Amsterdam said, "But in fact, these schools work like snow machines for Gülen."
"Smiley later uses enormous amounts of money for political donations to hide his illegal activities," he said.
According to an old American teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam is believed to have held separate meetings, transferred a certain part of their salaries to the organisation, "Gülen members of the Turkish Armed Forces work in similar operations," he said.
Impact incentives have strengthened their positions over the years.
"However, as the army was functioning normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the stage."
Amsterdam finished his article like this:
Political makers in the United States have a question of interest in events after July 15th and 16th, and that's expected.
However, while the two allies are on a diplomatic level, individual authorities must wake up to a series of violations of US laws in Gülen's operations.

We agree on a lot of things.
We agree on a number of issues such as Syria's territorial integrity, border integrity, and the removal of DAEK and other terrorist organisations in Syria, and having a conservative government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we'll keep talking about it the way it always is.
Armistice, Geneva, we agree on continuing negotiations.
It doesn't mean anything unless the majority of the consensus actually brings results.
"The important thing is to get results," he said.
"We went to Moscow to see when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria."
"The purpose of us building these mechanisms is to establish what steps are taken especially in the fight against the DAEF here, and any event must be coordinated to prevent the accident from happening," he said.
"Iran and Turkey are two brothers and sisters."
The arbiters must not decide, so that we can make a deal between ourselves.
I had a little website.
We should be able to make these deals before we go to the board.

He said, "He did what he shouldn't have done to an animal."
Osman O., the wounded uncle, said, "What kind of a citizen who shot these kids?"
It could be an accident, and a person could die in an accident.
But it's brutal for him to grab the wounded and take them to the hospital in the trunk of the car.
We're followers until the end of this.
One of these kids is suffering from death.
The other one's in critical condition.
He's bringing the wounded from Narince to Kahta in the trunk of the car.
God damn it.
Don't let such a wild event happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're going to be plaintiffs, and we're not going to let this go.

Watch out for the kids' habits
Dr. Bilgin Giray, Faculty of Dental Medicine, said the children were relieved by this reflex because they couldn't do the chewing process at their early age.
"Finger absorption is a phenomenon that has been seen from birth to 3 to 4 years old."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The kid who sucks his finger to satisfy his need for breast feeding in his infancy, and after he's 1-5 years old, the mother sucks his finger to take away his breast and relax.
He said, "When he is bored and drowsy, when he is troubled, and when he leaves his mother, he is able to suck his finger."
Assoc stressed that the lack of mother-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child was not developed enough. Dr. Bilgin Giray explained the effects of this behavior to dental health:
Finger-sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shape of the child's dental structure.
The pressure that comes out during the suction is pushed forward, while the teeth below are pushed back.
Which causes the lower jaw to be located behind, disrupting the balance of the palate and dental structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that the speech disorder and closing look aesthetically bad.
"We can protect our children from closing and adding problems before jaw development is complete," Assoc noted at the age of 6-7, when permanent teeth start dating.
"Therefore today, like the children's eyes and hearing controls, the mouth structure must be controlled," he completed his remarks.
New breath in close vision treatment: Trifocal Lensler
Patients after the cataract treatment naturally don't want to use glasses.
For many years, very focused lenses have already been used to solve this problem in our patients.
With trifocal lenses that have been used recently, it has taken a step further to the success of treatment in this area.
The difference between trifocal lenses and other lenses is not only the distance or close distance, but also the ability to provide a clear view in distance.
Treatment of distant, close or distant vision disorders
The distance in vision disorders represents a point that we often use in our daily lives.
For example, the display panel of cars is the distance we call portable computers or the length of 60 to 70 cm.
With trifocal lenses fixing intervals, our patients don't need to use glasses in any way close or far.
Another advantage provided by trifocal lenses is reducing night complaints.
"Trifocal lens treatment for every distance is no different from normal cataract treatment," said Dr. Volkan Hürmeric.
The patients we treat with trifocal treatment are easily monitored by a seven-to-10-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It's an operation that increases the quality of life for people who drive, use computers, love to read, and live a more active life.
You can also apply to the eye disease expert to see if any of the procedures that can be applied to any 18-year-old patient are appropriate for you.
It's not used in varicose cardiovascular surgery!
Varis is a rare disease in recent years.
The fact that genetic intimacy is a primary factor causes long hours, long hours, long-standing jobs, and long-term living heir complaints to increase.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
I have an heir, and questions like what happens if I have a heart attack in the future are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of veins in the leg:
The first leg has a deep vein system called the main road that leads dirty blood to the lungs and collects the actual dirty blood of the leg.
These are called deep femoral ven and floating femoral ven.
The problems in these vessels are more rare, the veins cannot be shut down in their disease, and drug treatments are applied to keep these vessels open.
In the leg, there's a surface vein system that leads dirty blood into the lungs, which we call a side road that combines with a deep vein system in the crotch.
This system is composed of two large and two small phallic valves we call valves.
In all four of these vessels, failure and heir can grow.
Toplarvessels that can be used in heart surgery are superficial vessels called large pure vein.
Without these vessels, there's no harm in the body, so they can be used in heart surgery.
But these vessels need to be healthy to be used in heart surgery.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The surgical removal of the varicose vessels, or the burning of the laser, will reduce the workload of deep vessels and allow the leg to be healthier.
A false belief among the public is that the veins can be used as backup, even if they are hereditary.
The varicose vein is never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
Repository vascular systems that can be used in cardiac surgery are located under the chest cage, around the stomach and around the arm.
So it's impossible to keep the barrel vein waiting to use for the heart and worry about it.

A meaningful message from Uzbek prior to the Super Cup
President Dursun Uzbek of the Galatasaray Sports Club issued a statement prior to the Super Cup Final, which will be played between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.

Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, two-root and two popular clubs of Turkish sports, will face the Super Cup at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday (August 13th).
This game is neither the first nor last game in our two beautiful clubs' competition that has left behind an anchor.
But timing is a very vital encounter.
As we all know, our country has been through a great deal on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization / Parallel State Construction (FETÖ / PDY), which meant our democracy, was overcome by the unity and unity of all communities.
That night, as people, we paid heavy prices.
We gave him martyrs.

This bitter price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of peace, not fighting in this land.
Representatives of Turkish sports that night opposed the coup as a single voice, as a single heart; they all joined democracy together.
In these critical days, we need the unifying properties of sports more than ever.
I wish this match, which coincides with our beloved opponent, Süleyman Seba's 2nd anniversary and the new football season, which is named after the legendary captain of our club, Turgey Sheren, to be the beginning of love and peace in Turkish sports.
At the end of the game, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans will share half of it in front of the bleachers, no matter what the score is, I hope that the winner is our country and Turkish sports.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home while Britain covers gold
While the Great Britain team held their title from London in 2012, the Scottish Callum Skinner ran for victory last night at the Rio racetrack in the men's race.
Glasgowlu, 23-year-old racer, took the lead post adopted by Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and this young man, on his way home with a glorified New Zealand suit, was proud of this legend.
Britain received a shocking victory at the event four years before Hoy took five out of six Olympic gold.
And even though Hoy retired, they reiterated the race World Championship in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was that expert startup Jamie Staff was replaced.
They did it right when Hindens showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had seen the potential that Scot had now achieved, and the British trainers had not given up on Skinner.
Hindens, Kenny and Skinner, who won with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record on the ranking tour, but in the first round, New Zealand reset this record.
And the British triad went to the duel for gold.
Even though Hindens was a little behind on his own tour, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner put up with it.
Most of the transformation that led to Kenny and Skinner holding tempo was this strategy change, using a larger tool to slow him down.
Hoy watched them as the BBC expert commentator, and when they got to the podium, Skinner got caught in Kenny and Hindins' eye.
Glasgowlu, 23-year-old Skinner said, "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and announce my name.
We broke the Olympic record at the final and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindens admitted that after winning a victory with Kenny and Hoy in 2012, he fell deliberately on the track after a bad start.
Then he reacted to that comment, and there was no way to make demands from Britain's opponents.
This time, there was no such problem with an incredible victory.
"With all the Great British flags on the stand, we were as if we were in London."
We're just a team set up three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world racing, so it's really amazing to have won again at the Olympics.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress we've shown in the last five months, we'll have five more days to successfully pass on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of renewing three gold wins in one Olympics is not so impossible.
This will mean that Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoy, was born March 23rd (also born with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), has reached six gold medals and a silver medal.
That means the same level as Hoy.
Kenny's gonna be in the sprint race from now on; it's gonna start today, and it's gonna take three days.
"For now, I'm just enjoying it.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win by yourself, you feel lonely.
"If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given the title of knights."
This is just the event of today's medal, but there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull ranked first in the four-mile team race.
They completed the runway in 3: 51,943.
The world record, set by the winner in London 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and final (22: 42) will be set in the second episode today, and Wiggins will certainly draw all attention to you.
Yesterday, before the ranking tour, the authorities called him to measure his height, and he had a disagreement with the officers.
During the women's event tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record for 4: 13.260.
The Great Britain team is counting on the strong bike team to take over the reins and win many medals during the middle of the Olympic Games.
After a great deal of dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were greatly reduced in Rio.
In the background, there have been many bad developments involving coach Shane Sutton's resignation in April due to gender and bullying charges and the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But on the first night after the races on the track, it shows that the epic reputation for Great Britain to finish in perfect time will be reproven this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the Portland insulation chamber is suspicious.
The future of the Portland aluminum insulate in Victoria, and the work of hundreds of workers, the energy company that provided energy to the facility, fell into uncertainty after one of the facility owners announced the annulment of a supply contract, which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts.
This move was followed by the decision by the Victoria government earlier this year to keep the plant running.
20 years of constant subsidies expired in November.
The job could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland facility by 2000.
Any closure could lead to a direct or indirect risk of about 2,000 jobs.
And since the insulation furnace has consumed about 10% of Victoria's electricity, additional chain effects can also occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the Izabe stove, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland insulate facility is losing money and facing the risk of closing.
These developments were initially followed by speculation over several years, based on the strengthening of Australian dollars and the recent consumption price of the facility.
AGL, which provides energy from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said the great aluminum insulate, expects the three other owners to act to terminate their contracts.
Most of the facility belongs to Alcoa and Alumina's joint initiative, and China's CTIC, Japan's Marubeni Corp companies have smaller shares.
"The AGL is waiting for the Portland facility to continue working, which means that the Izabe stove will continue to demand physical electricity," he said.
The AGL said the contracts were "risk balancing contracts" that had to take effect from November 2016.
Since the contracts are a 12-month period of liberation, they will be completed in 2017.
"Therefore, the AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to 2017 financial years," the energy company said.
The effects that the AGL can be exposed to in the 2018 Financial Year and after potential gain are limited to its adoption of a strong-term contract position for total electricity prices.
The AGL has expressed that their contracts in their accounts have already dropped by 187 million dollars due to the expected "absolution."
The decision on the termination of contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or provide electricity to the Izabe chamber," Alcoa said.
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; this contract was supposed to take effect in November this year, but he hasn't explained why it hasn't been withdrawn from the contract yet.
Analysts are wary that the Portland insulation chamber in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle will be closed due to economic difficulties in the sector.
At the beginning of this week, Stephen Mikkels, head of operations for the AGL, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy.
In case both of these facilities are off the market, [electricity] will cause the demand in the market to drop significantly.
And as a manufacturer, that wouldn't be a good development for us. "

After the cover was announced, the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (trouble-making Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite showworld uncle, Keeping Up, Ryan Seacrest) (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashian-Jenner program) had released a real reality video; in the video, the family had prepared a classic party after forgetting the cover of their sisters.
Although this is almost every single episode of "birthday" of children's television shows (Seacrest 8: 00 in the morning with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit), Kris should somehow include other girls in this presentation.
With this development in Vogue's September number, we are definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's sister Kim may have passed him on the cover of Vogue (shared the cover with his wife Kanye West in April 2014) but the magazine's September cover is a success on its own.
Vogue's September was the most selling number of the year.
With the thickness of the coffee table book more than a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista discovered that the 832-page skin of last year had a commercial content in 615).
The opening of the cover star is a closely monitored process; for the past two years, the images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Among the women on the cover before are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been included in "celebrities who model more than famous models."
The Oscar-winning Dior envoy Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and the next year, the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
However, even in the previous category of Miss Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, it can be said that her surroundings are pretty good.
These celebrities are not a relative of celebrities or reality show stars or young people of the day who know how to shoot good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of them).
These are all women who are legitimate, leading the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, on the cover of last year, had one of the best times of her career with Lemonade's exit.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to the reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Halid and called them "the sluts of time."
When word came out that Jenner was going to be on Vogue's cover, that thought came back to the surface.
But it seems inappropriate to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September edition.
He's literally a supermodel.
He's going to Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
Estee Lauder is giving you a fondutan.
He's selling his own pictures of you and his sisters in pay-per-view applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, maybe he's just on TV on a reality show to see his brother Kourtney and his kids.
Public legal support centers turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for more funding cuts in already-forced operations, more than 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are being turned back from social law support centers.
Three of the five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and non-fair evacuation decisions) are being turned back looking for free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have consumed their events, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal support centers are scheduled to be denied more than 30 per cent of federal financing.
James Farrel, director of the Queensland Support Centre for Public Law Center, has reported that thousands have been rejected every year in the National Commission's last edition report.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision was not withdrawn.
"Queensland's social legal support centers are taking chronic insufficient support, which means that thousands of people can't reach vital services that they need," he said.
People who are in violent relationships, struggling with power and backbreaking forces, families in the process of leaving, and workers who have been dismantled fairly... all face problems with legal dimensions, and according to this report, they cannot reach the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding at 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of unprotected Queenslands are forced to deal with more complicated legal problems without any help.
We urge the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to take back these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the support they need when they face a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal support financing to a national average level.
Now we need to look at social legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment the Palaszczuk government will invest in this important study.
Donald Trump's campaign team was sued after the staff claimed to have pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued for charges that the director of the North Carolina operations has not committed any action after being told that he pulled a gun on a staff while traveling in February.
The case was announced on Wednesday in a case filed by former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the state campaign team.
Bordini said he waited months for him to take care of the situation from the inside, but later he realized it wasn't going to happen.
According to Bordini's complaint, Director, Earl Philip "pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel towards Vincent's kneecaps."
According to the complaint, Bordini found out that at least four other people had the same experience as Phillip after filing a complaint against the leaders of the local and regional campaign.
Bordini complained, "There's no need for weapons to be fired for damage."
The case was opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a move against the crowd in North Carolina, saying that "Second Amendment people" (as they appear to be armed owners and arms supporters) could act in the event of Hillary Clinton's election and choosing her own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media evaluated these words outside the context and did not support violence.
Bordini is asking Phillip for compensation for his complaint, for violation of surveillance, for the campaign team, for assault, battery and mental damage.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not return quickly to the message that asked him to comment.
Their efforts to reach Phillip have been fruitless.
WCCB, a local news activist in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His advisory company, Innovative Consulting Services, has not been called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is conducting a controversial campaign.

I need you to notify the prosecutors.
It's a debt of patriotism.
He said, "Not everyone knows intelligence, not the safety, not the law, but look, the guys are running."
As part of the work done, online denouncing has been launched by the Interior Ministry, the Police Department and the National Intelligence Agency (MİT).
According to this, the citizens will be able to deliver those who serve FETÖ, the organisation activities he knows, the institutions that belong to the organisation to the police and the MIT.
The information of the people who will report by the form submitted to service through the links of www.eg.gov.tr / tip, www.mit.gov.tr / katkki will be kept hidden.
Those who want to report submitted by the Police Department will be able to add documents.

They were inspired by the basement and made the example village in Sivas.
Canköy, a member of SiVAS's Solaova County, was made 'an example village' in co-operation with the Governorship and the philanthropist businessman.
In the village where the roads were paved and floated with parquet stones on their sidewalk, all houses were painted blue and white, as an example of the basement district of Muğla.
The Shadow Governorship has prepared a model village project to increase the image and quality of villages connected to the province.
In this context, the model village was selected as the 66-digit Canköy, 12 kilometers from the county centre.
The roads of the village, which has increased infrastructure and infrastructure services, were paved with parke stone.
The village houses with different colors were painted by the support of the businessman Selahattin Ayan, who owned the Petit Pastas.
The whole village is covered in buildings painted with white and blue colors.
_
"The more modern view of the village was part of our project, all of the houses are one color," Göraova Kasekova Deputy Erkan Jesus Erat said, adding that they were preparing this project to form a role model for other villages.
When we started this project, we looked for an example.
When we went to the basement, we noticed the view of houses with white paint and blue windows.
So we wanted to take a sample of the basement because of the white cleanliness and the positive effect on humans.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in Canköy in white and blue colors.
This work was done by government and philanthropist co-operation.
The project cost about 200,000 lire.
With work, our Canköy in Sivas became a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and the support of our businessmen again.
The Canköy Mukhtar Abdullah Macit, 66, said the village had received a new image with the support of the State's Office.
Macit thanked everyone who had worked hard, saying that being a model village has made themselves and the people of the village very happy.

Controlled entity fund recommissions
Turkey's Heritage Fund, which is expected to enter among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the silent bag of law on objections.
Due to the lack of the control mechanism, the funds have been reassigned, but they have been reinterviewed in the commission without any changes.
"We are certainly opposed to the lack of public assets, pensions from workers, unemployment funds, which will be collected for workers," CHP MP and Commission Commissioner Utku Çakızözer, who evaluated the Turkish Heritage Fund proposal to sozcu.com.tr, which the AKP has brought in, said.
The Turkish Heritage Fund proposed by the government to provide long-term funding for investments and projects was removed from the bag on Tuesday, the opposition said it should also be discussed.
However, the AKP has restored the proposal to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same way today.
Utku Çakırözer, a member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, told CHP concerns and concerns about the proposed law.
"When the formation of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in a bag of legislation, our former Finance Minister, Zeceriya Buzel, who was head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, suggested that it be removed from the law and discussed in detail."
The government, who accepted this view, withdrew the bill.
The bill came back to the commission yesterday in the same way.
"The government seems to insist that it be removed from parliament within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern in this proposal of law is impasse," he said.
"The public-owned assets, pension cuts from workers, income from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, income from privatisation, which is being handed over to a structure that does not have any responsibility," he said.
"But we have a savings deficit."
So the fund will be made up of public resources, people's money.
The total of 100 billion in unemployment funds are planned to transfer $50 billion from the individual pension fund, which has been forced into employees.
"So this funds that will be completely with the public's money must be under public control and not be spent irresponsibly," he said.
Stressing that it is unacceptable to keep a fund of state assets out of parliamentary control, where the resources of the state are collected, in debt, Çakırözer expressed concern and concern about the proposal for the Programme of the Fons:
Business and procedures on gathering, spending, borrowing of such a large public presence cannot be outdated only by the control of independent audit companies.
There must be public control and a transparent structure.
There are no provisions for the rule of the State Fund's control and transparency of the Constitutional institutions.
No restrictions on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will be able to ask how to use this fund.
The goal of the fund is to finance major projects.
There's no need to build an unsupervised fund outside the budget for that.
Why don't you put it in the budget?
And so, naturally, the question comes to mind, "Why is Saisştaş and Parliament running?"
"If such a fund is needed, it can be discussed."
But if the government insists on it, then we have to ensure that international standards are valid in Turkey in other countries where such investment funds are established.
It must be configured in some way that the control and responsibility mechanism are being brought in.
It has to be set up to pay for its own money, which will not have poets on it.
"We are happy that the AKP is listening to our criticism in the Parliament especially after the July 15th coup attempt," Çakırözer underlined his opposition to the legislative proposal.
In this proposal, we hope the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We are opposed to the use of national beings without rules, to transfer them, to the irresponsible of those who use them, to have no public control.
"The wanted Property Fund can only be useful if these concerns are removed," he said.
The proposed law has been discovered that efforts have been made to ensure reconciliation between the AKP and the opposition.
"The confidence we hear about Turkey is the investments we make."
"Our 30 billion-euro investment in the last five years is a sign of the trust we have heard about the future of our country," said Ford Automotive Board President Ali Coach at a meeting in Istanbul.
Coach Holding met with Vice President and Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koç at a meeting with several foreign capital companies, director of the Istanbul Industrial Room (ISO), on "those who trust Turkey, the producers in Turkey."
"Our partners and we are filling it with our investments and actions," Ali Coach said at the meeting, saying, "Our faith and trust in our country is not only verbal."
The $30 billion investment we've made in the last five years is a sign of trust in the future of our country.
In order for Turkey to attract more foreign investments, its indestructible issues are a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in international standards, a qualified labour force and an innovation, entrepreneurship and folding value.
In the last few years, our government has presented the most comprehensive incentives of our Republic history to our industrialists.
"I believe that with these incentives and integrated strategies, we will be able to launch a new" Investment Movement. "
"None of this is just the problem of a single country anymore, but as global players," said Hüseyin Gelis, president and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey Board.
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring those who weren't in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but we must have our horizons open in this area," he said.
"Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell," Shell said.
We believe in Turkey's potential and its future.
At first, we invested in many areas, energy, and we continue to do it.
We thank our president, our Prime Minister, and our ministers for their support for international investors.
There are studies that give confidence to international investors.
"This is in the direction of increasing our country's competitiveness," he said.
"On August 10th, our Global CEO would come to Turkey."
But the journey has been delayed.
That's what we resisted.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made demands for bulletproof cars, protection.
And then when he got here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned happily to his country.
Investment in a country is like marriage.
First of all, if everything goes well, you get engaged and get married by planning long term.
We're married to Turkey, and we have no intention of divorce.
Turned from the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım spoke to businessmen with a televised conference at the Swiss Hotel, held by the Istanbul Industrial Room on "People who trust Turkey, producers in Turkey."
"We must not miss the transition process to the industrial sector in the industrial sector and the industrial sector to the Industrial 4.0," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, expressing Turkey's competitiveness.
"The multiplication value is high, and if we care about the country's locomotive and the 2023 goals, we need to think about the industrial revolution with the IT and technology revolution, and we need to do it," he said.
"We were talking about another Turkey today," Prime Minister Yıldırım added on the night of July 15th, saying, "those who are referring to the future of our country, those who are trying to destroy its democracy, the bastards who are not even afraid to bomb our Gazi Parliament."
We were going to talk about Turkey between the third world countries, where the coup and administration were seized, the national will was eliminated and the world fell from the developing nations.
"Thank God, we have eliminated this trouble with the presence of our nation, our commander-in-chief, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the determination of our government," he said.
Prime Minister Yıldırım added: "We will rise quickly from the impact of this incident and look ahead of us."
It's never true that we live with constant blows.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake Turkey's economy.
Chaos and those waiting for crisis were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are on its feet.
Our banking industry, our financial sector, continues to work in a healthy way.
In 2015, foreign trade deficit appears to have dropped by 25 per cent.
The national income rate of the cari deficit was 5.8 per cent in 2014, while that rate was reduced to 4.5 in 2015.
At the end of this year, we aim to reduce it to 4.
We'll never change our tight stance in public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget was higher than the national income of 130 countries.
We reduced the national income rate of over 11% of the budget deficit to 1.3 per cent in 2015, and we're trying to protect these rates.
In public debt, we are better off than the EU, than most countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector continues to work on a solid ground.
"Our Central Bank did not need to exchange for the market on July 15th, and we have over $121 billion in gross reserves, which are not a reduction in our reserves," he said.
"We are also doing extensive arrangements to save you from your baggage towards the past," Prime Minister Yıldırım said, citing the development of the economy, the growth of production and the creation of new employment areas.
We've made a lot of arrangements and continue to pass through the stock pardon until we've restored the cash and the unpaid tax debt.
"You continue to produce for the country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove obstacles in front of you one by one," he said.

Turkey does not leave the West, it does not give up the European Union
Mehmet Simsek: Turkey does not leave the West, it does not give up the European Union
Deputy Chief Mehmet Simsek, Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlı attended a meeting with Economy Minister Nihat Zeybecci in Istanbul Industry Room (ISO) on "those who trust Turkey, the producers in Turkey."
"On the night of July 15th and after July 15th, I think there are many good results from the developments," Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özli said at the meeting.
The most important of all is the spirit of unity and unity that all Turkey feels deeply at the moment.
The July 15th process showed how strong the Turkish economy has dynamics, and how much society has incorporated democracy.
"For a society that has captured this level in economics and democracy, it is clear that the next process will be better and faster," he said.
_
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said they were having trouble telling the world about the July 15th coup attempt from Faruk Özlı on the stand.
"If 63.4% of the first five sides of my real sector are going to interest, we need to focus on our power."
That's why our president turns around and says it.
With the Reel sector, with the banking system, with the government, politics, after the 15 July civil Turkish democratic revolution, politics will need to get out of the trouble Turkey has shown in unity and unity.
And we welcome the latest developments on that.
"I hope that in the coming period, we will be able to achieve sustainability, continuity, by supporting this competition, which began with the incentives of our president, which began at zero point nine, like the eighties, as economic management."
"We will bring YORAL PAAPORTU, IRACATICIN EMRINA"
"In the coming period, we will be the winners of the world," Nihat Zeybekci said, "We will not leave an ungoing country in the leadership of our president, our Prime Minister, nor leave unstolen doors."
We're not leaving anyone we haven't contacted about boosting our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore this; nor will we be one of the birds in the hand, when we are chasing after the bird in the branch."
"One of the latest decisions is that we have completed his rule in the economy ministry; we will now give our exporter, approximately 17 to 20,000 figures, a privileged green passport representing this country," Zeybekci said later.
"THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FOUNDS"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek quoted Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek as "nightmare" for the coup attempt and the OHAL, which was later declared after July 15, as saying, "But he's behind us, we need to look ahead."
"Of course, those involved in this coup attempt need to be cleared of the state, and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms needed not to face such coup attempts again," he said for two simple reasons.
So as a climate required for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared, and so far, very serious structural reforms have been made.
"While we were doing all this, of course, we acted in democratic principles and law states, and we will continue to do so."
Noting that life has returned to normal in many areas, he stressed that there is no reason for the concern of companies and individuals who have not been involved in the financing of terrorism.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy are strong, because when you look at the origins of recent issues, you will see that this network of betrayal is involved.
"Therefore, the removal of this terrorist organization from the state will strengthen Turkey's democracy," he said.
"Turkey has returned to its original agenda, progress in structural reforms," he said, expressing that the economic foundations are generally intact and that they have returned to normal structural reform agenda without wasting any time.
Structural reforms are already indispensable, because popularity, protection in the world is increasing.
"Turkey can only reform and prepare for the future," he said.
Finally, he stressed that Turkey will not fall out of the West, "Turkey may sometimes be at variance with our Western allies, our friends; but Turkey does not leave the West, it does not give up the European Union," he said.
He jumped out of 25 yards into the sea and...
In Antalya, a 17-year-old Shamil Taiyar Flag was hospitalized when he jumped to sea from a 25-metre-long fayles called "Eagle Hill."
Shamil Tayyar Bayçı, who swam with his friends in the evening on the coast of the consulate, then jumped into the sea from the 25-metre-high cliffs known as "Eagle Hill" under the barrel.
The professional swimmer, Shamil Taiyar Flashman, was hurt by the impact of the water.
Having difficulty moving in the sea, the Flashman has been brought ashore by his friends, who are still professional swimmers, just like him.
Paramedics who arrived at the scene on the report took Shamil Tayyar Bayçı to Antalya Education and Research Hospital in an ambulance following the intervention.
The treatment has been recorded as no vital threat to the Bahiker.
A friend of the Marauder who testified to the police said, "When he jumped off Eagle Hill, his neck got hurt."
He said, "We didn't know this was gonna happen."

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer only renewal and prosperity throughout the country, not only in our local communities and not in London.
I think this will make Heathrow quite attractive, as we've made an incredible effort to benefit all nations and regions from the Games in London 2012.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And by creating opportunities for local communities and companies near Heathrow, we will do it again.
Only 10,000 new interns for our local communities will create 40,000 new jobs and we will not leave unemployed teenagers around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be disgraced throughout the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be seen wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is not only a few people, but a infrastructure project for many.
The expansion leaves an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth and many skills and jobs both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
In Heathrow, we have a great team of T5 (the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row) that has implemented an investment of 11 billion pounds in time for the world's two busiest track and worth of infrastructure in the budget.
Now we're ready to present a third track, supported by a private investment worth 16 billion pounds.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It's time to channel this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow and secure our trade future and create many skills and jobs that Britain would be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the head of the Heathrow Board and the former Treasury Department Trade Secretary
Adblock Plus is like a cat-mouse game about Facebook advertising prevention.
According to one of the companies that does software to block advertising prevention software for online advertising companies, it looks like "cat-mouse game."
On Thursday, Adblock Plus announced that Facebook would block ad blockers from their desktop site only two days later, and released a blog that said its users could update their filters to prevent ads in social networks.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around commercials to make it difficult for advertisers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says he's decoding new codes now.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote, "This is a forward backfight between the open source advertising community and those who are trying to prevent it from being invented, since the moment the ad was invented," and it is possible that Facebook will produce its own solution soon.
The world's largest social media company in this struggle shows how much concern advertising blowers have caused for the sector.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people use advertising blockers globally, which is four times the number of people using software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion-day active users accessing Facebook with mobile devices, mobile commercials now constitute 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to a word, mobile advertising blockers are after Facebook's mobile applications for the social network and the ad blockers on the company table because it's not effective in Instagram.
Since Facebook considers this kind of move worth investing, desktop ads should still be able to provide sufficient income.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that people will update the "advertising choices" vehicle so that they can better control the ads presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming, and that the extracurricular content on the site would prevent part of it.
A Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement, "This doesn't give people a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem."
Advertising blockers are a blunt tool, so we're focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to give control to people.
A woman ran into a Swiss highway; it looks like suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are looking for people who witnessed a couple of cars hitting her on the highway earlier on Thursday in the case that looked like suicide.
The incident occurred Thursday at A1 near Morges in the Vaud canton just after midnight.
Vaud police said that she was lying on the ground in the dark of the night, and a few cars hit her.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman who obviously wanted to kill herself was hit by several vehicles including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police have stated that several of the drivers involved have been interviewed but some have not been identified and have asked them and everyone involved to apply for them.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that "a" reasonable "step has been filed in cases like this."
However, it is not yet known whether drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor needs to identify, "Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both included one person on the highway in the dark), the paper ruled that drivers should not expect a pedestrian to cross the street in the middle of the night.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer who crashed into a man who was on the road near Paynne in August 2014 was found innocent of causing death due to negligence.
The court stated that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and passed out on the road.
The court said that the police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, used the vehicle in a reasonable manner, and that the presence of a man on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable."
Anyone who knows about this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police from phones 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be available to live
According to the forecast of the new NASA climate model, Venus once had conditions for life.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Studies Institute developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to what climate scientists used.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus once hosted similar conditions on Earth with its warm, non-water surface and its atmosphere full of CO2.
Scientists have explained in the past that Venus's low turn speed is thick with the atmosphere layer.
However, the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and could still turn slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although his planet has more dry territory than Earth, he may have once had enough water and protection against geographical variation and rapid vaporization.
The old Venus was also benefiting from a much darker sun by 30%.
"The slow return of Venus in the simulation of the GISS model allowed the daylight to turn towards the sun for almost two months at a time," said the GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news bulletin.
It was heating up the surface, causing the rains to create thick clouds that move like an umbrella protecting the surface from solar warming.
As a result, the average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than the Earth was today.
The model provided Venus with a story similar to the evolution proposed by planetary scientists before.
Although once upon a time, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in a few billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vaporized by ultraviolet radiation.
Hydrogen's run out, and there's a thick atmosphere full of carbon dioxide that only has a deadly greenhouse gas effect, so as we know today, Venus.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysic Studies articles.
Patrick Roy resigned from the Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy resigned as vice president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations on Thursday, saying the team was not allowed to make a decision.
Joe Sakic, vice president of Colorado / general director, approved this development and said the club would start looking for a new trainer immediately.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as vice president of the Colorado Avalanche and hockey operations with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 years old.
I've been thinking a lot about how I can improve this team by giving it the depth it needs and how I can get it to a higher level.
To achieve that, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the company's vision.
He also has to have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
In the current situation, these conditions are not met yet.
Sakic, who recruited Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today."
We thank him for everything he did for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-14.
He won 112 points and got the team to finish the league first, but Colorado was defeated in Minnesota during the first round of the playoff period, and in both years, he missed the post-season games.
Avalanche passed his goal 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and received five points less than necessary for the second Joker field at the Western Conference.
Roy, the goalkeeper on the Honor List, won four Stanley Cup, both for the Montreal Canadiens, both for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to negotiate with the strike suspended
The strike for oil workers in the North Sea has been suspended due to the price, and the main negotiator has started arguing about a new round of talks.
The oil field service company is gradually conducted on platforms in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell against Wood Group.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions have decided to start the process again for the solution to the current dispute," a joint statement said.
In the next few weeks, we will hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new perspective on problems starting next week.
Workers' unions said that this protest has been their first action since 25 years against wage cuts that could reach 30 per cent.
Wood Group cut approximately 9 per cent this year in payments to its contractors in the North Sea due to negative pressure in the market.
After this process of reducing the company's wage, their shipments on the coast were reduced by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will provide the company with the necessary area to pass through the troubled period in the market.
Shell fired thousands of people during the merger with the British energy company BG Group and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in the country by 10: 00.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation that Britain decided to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson will meet with the workers' leaders earlier this week and discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the North Sea and for the minority throughout the country," he said.
Despite the average $7 billion investment in the past five years, new projects in the North Sea are expected to be invested less than 1.4 billion in 2016.
Kepler measured the speed of returning stars in the constellation Ulker
The Kepler space telescope helped astronomers create the most complete catalog for the speed of returning stars in the Ulker constellation.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the team star are spinning at a variable rate and why the rotating times are interested in the formation of the planet.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, said in a news bulletin, "When we compare our results to star clusters, we hope to know more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the past of the solar system."
The ulker team star is 445 light years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation were created 125 million years ago and reached the new level of maturity.
They're spinning at the highest possible speed in their entire lives.
At the speed of the turn of the hill, stars at this stage of maturity form a vast amount of starwind.
As these winds move through the magnetic fields of the stars, it creates a breaking effect on the stars.
As a star grows older, its rotation rate begins to drop.
Kepler measures the speed of each star spinning by monitoring the time between the appearance of visible starspots like sunspots.
The latest rotation speed catalog suggests that larger stars are spinning faster than small stars.
Rebull described the stars as dancers, making the big ones turn on one foot slower than the smaller ones.
"We see that those who turn slowly in the Ulker Ballet are much heavier, and those who turn fast are very light stars."
Since the ulker team star is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare star properties and rotation speeds.
Rebull said, "As young and old of the national team, it provides theoretical models for starbacks in both directions."
We have more to learn about how the speed of the stars return, when and why they fall, and why they leave their dancing shoes in a corner.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the return speed of the Ulker team star in three new articles that will soon be published in Astronomy Magazine.
